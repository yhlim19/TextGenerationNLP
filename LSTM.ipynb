I recall him talking\\r\\nbriefly about fighting the Bolsheviki in Archangel. \"The machine gun\\r\\nbullets trimmed the leaves off the trees, as if it were fall.\" Like most\\r\\nveterans, he had little else to say.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis book mentions his campaign on page 736; \"August 3, 1918.--President\\r\\nWilson announces new policy regarding Russia and agrees to cooperate\\r\\nwith Great Britain, France and Japan in sending forces to Murmansk,\\r\\nArchangel and Vladivostok.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy father\\'s experience seems to be described in the following excerpt\\r\\nfrom the University of Michigan \"The University Record\", April 5, 1999.\\r\\n\"Bentley showcases items from World War I \\'Polar Bears\\'\"; by Joanne\\r\\nNesbit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"During the summer of 1918, the U.S. Army\\'s 85th Division, made up\\r\\nprimarily of men from Michigan and Wisconsin, completed training at Fort\\r\\nCuster in Battle Creek, Mich., and proceeded to England. The 5,000\\r\\ntroops of the division\\'s 339th Infantry and support units realized that\\r\\nthey were not being sent to France to join the great battles on the\\r\\nWestern Front when they were issued Russian weapons and equipment and\\r\\nlectured on life in the Arctic regions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When they reached their destination in early September, 600 miles north\\r\\nof Moscow, the men of the 339th joined an international force commanded\\r\\nby the British that had been sent to northern Russia for purposes that\\r\\nwere never made clear. The Americans were soon spread in small fighting\\r\\nunits across hundreds of miles of the Russian forest fighting the\\r\\nBolsheviks who had taken power in Petrograd and Moscow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The day of the Armistice (Nov. 11) when fighting ceased for other\\r\\nAmerican armies, the allied soldiers were fighting the Bolsheviks said\\r\\nto be led by Trotsky himself. After three days, the allies finally were\\r\\nable to drive off the Bolsheviks. While this fight was a victory for the\\r\\nAmericans, the battle led to the realization that the war was not over\\r\\nfor these men. As the weeks and months passed and more battles were\\r\\nfought, the men began to wonder if they would ever get home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The men of the 339th generally were well equipped with winter clothing\\r\\nduring the winter of 1918-19 while stationed near the Arctic Circle,\\r\\nwhere temperatures reached minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There was little daylight for months at a time. Knowing that the war was\\r\\nover for other American soldiers, the morale of the troops declined\\r\\nthroughout the winter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Families and friends of the men began to clamor for their return.\\r\\nPoliticians unwilling to support an undeclared war against the Russian\\r\\ngovernment joined in their demand. A petition to Congress was\\r\\ncirculated. Several of the British and French units mutinied and refused\\r\\nto continue fighting. In early April, the American troops learned that\\r\\nthey would be withdrawn as soon as the harbor at Archangel was cleared\\r\\nof ice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was not until June of 1919 that the men of the 339th sailed from\\r\\nRussia and adopted the polar bear as their regimental symbol. After a\\r\\nstop in New York, the troops went on to Detroit where they took part in\\r\\na gala July 4 homecoming parade at Belle Isle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe converted text for several chapters is copied from Project\\r\\nGutenberg\\'s eBook 16282, History of the World War, Vol. 3, prepared by\\r\\nJuliet Sutherland, Jennifer Zickerman, and the Project Gutenberg Online\\r\\nDistributed Proofreading Team. This edition has minor differences,\\r\\nmostly additional passages and images.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen considering monetary values listed in the text, one United States\\r\\ndollar in 1918 is equivalent to about thirteen dollars in 2006. One\\r\\nUnited States dollar in 1918 is equivalent to about 5.6 French Francs in\\r\\n1918; one Franc in 1918 is equivalent to about 2.3 dollars in 2006.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor additional insight  into the pilots and air battles of the war read\\r\\n\"The Red Knight of Germany; The Story of Baron von Richthofen, Germany\\'s\\r\\nGreat War Bird\" by  Floyd Gibbons. This book is copyright 1927 and will\\r\\nnot be freely available online until 2022.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the PDf and Doc versions, the following pages contain additional maps\\r\\nthat may assist in understanding some of the references to locations in\\r\\nthe text. The first shows Western France. The second map contains many\\r\\nof the locations of the European battles.  They are adapted from\\r\\nPutnam\\'s Handy Volume Atlas of the World, published by G.P. Putnam\\'s\\r\\nSons, New York and London, 1921.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next two maps from the USMA, West Point, map collection, compare\\r\\nEurope before and after World War I.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, a full map of the European theater has much detail. It should\\r\\nbe scaled up to about 500% for detail viewing. It is derived from a\\r\\nlarger map from Rand, McNally & Company\\'s Indexed Atlas of the World,\\r\\nCopyright 1898.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Western France; Southern England]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Western Front Battle Zone--Eastern France; Southern\\r\\nBelgium; Western Germany]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: WWI Locales; Lens; Cinde; Mons; Douai; Valenciennes;\\r\\nCambri Landrecies; St. Quentin; Sedan; Argonne Forest; Noyon; Chauny;\\r\\nSoissons; Rheims; Verdun; Metz; Chateau-Thierry; St. Mihiel; Paris;\\r\\nSezanne]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Europe Before World War I]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Europe After World War I]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Europe, 1898]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a glossary of unfamiliar (to me) terms and places.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoche\\r\\n  Disparaging term for a German.\\r\\n\\r\\ncamion\\r\\n  Truck or bus.

Written\\r\\nfrankly from the viewpoint of the United States and the Allies, it\\r\\nvisualizes the bloodiest and most destructive conflict of all the ages\\r\\nfrom its remote causes to its glorious conclusion and beneficent\\r\\nresults. The world-shaking rise of new democracies is set forth, and the\\r\\nenormous national and individual sacrifices producing that resurrection\\r\\nof human equality are detailed.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo ideals have been before us in the preparation of this necessary\\r\\nwork. These are simplicity and thoroughness. It is of no avail to\\r\\ndescribe the greatest of human events if the description is so confused\\r\\nthat the reader loses interest. Thoroughness is an historical essential\\r\\nbeyond price. So it is that official documents prepared in many\\r\\ninstances upon the field of battle, and others taken from the files of\\r\\nthe governments at war, are the basis of this work. Maps and photographs\\r\\nof unusual clearness and high authenticity illuminate the text. All that\\r\\nhas gone into war making, into the regeneration of the world, are herein\\r\\nset forth with historical particularity. The stark horrors of Belgium,\\r\\nthe blighting terrors of chemical warfare, the governmental restrictions\\r\\nplaced upon hundreds of millions of civilians, the war sacrifices\\r\\nfalling upon all the civilized peoples of earth, are in these pages.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a book that mankind can well read and treasure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I\\r\\n\\r\\nA WAR FOR INTERNATIONAL FREEDOM\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: The armistice was signed this morning. Everything\\r\\nfor which America fought has been accomplished. The war thus comes to an\\r\\nend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeaking to the Congress and the people of the United States, President\\r\\nWilson made this declaration on November 11, 1918. A few hours before he\\r\\nmade this statement, Germany, the empire of blood and iron, had agreed\\r\\nto an armistice, terms of which were the hardest and most humiliating\\r\\never imposed upon a nation of the first class. It was the end of a war\\r\\nfor which Germany had prepared for generations, a war bred of a\\r\\nphilosophy that Might can take its toll of earth\\'s possessions, of human\\r\\nlives and liberties, when and where it will. That philosophy involved\\r\\nthe cession to imperial Germany of the best years of young German\\r\\nmanhood, the training of German youths to be killers of men. It involved\\r\\nthe creation of a military caste, arrogant beyond all precedent, a caste\\r\\nthat set its strength and pride against the righteousness of democracy,\\r\\nagainst the possession of wealth and bodily comforts, a caste that\\r\\nvisualized itself as part of a power-mad Kaiser\\'s assumption that he and\\r\\nGod were to shape the destinies of earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Marshal Foch, the foremost strategist in the world, representing\\r\\nthe governments of the Allies and the United States, delivered to the\\r\\nemissaries of Germany terms upon which they might surrender, he brought\\r\\nto an end the bloodiest, the most destructive and the most beneficent\\r\\nwar the world has known. It is worthy of note in this connection that\\r\\nthe three great wars in which the United States of America engaged have\\r\\nbeen wars for freedom. The Revolutionary War was for the liberty of the\\r\\ncolonies; the Civil War was waged for the freedom of manhood and for the\\r\\nprinciple of the indissolubility of the Union; the World War, beginning\\r\\n1914, was fought for the right of small nations to self-government and\\r\\nfor the right of every country to the free use of the high seas.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than four million American men were under arms when the conflict\\r\\nended. Of these, more than two million were upon the fields of France\\r\\nand Italy. These were thoroughly trained in the military art. They had\\r\\nproved their right to be considered among the most formidable soldiers\\r\\nthe world has known. Against the brown rock of that host in khaki, the\\r\\nflower of German savagery and courage had broken at Chateau-Thierry.\\r\\nThere the high tide of Prussian militarism, after what had seemed to be\\r\\nan irresistible dash for the destruction of France, spent itself in the\\r\\nbloody froth and spume of bitter defeat. There the Prussian Guard\\r\\nencountered the Marines, the Iron Division and the other heroic\\r\\norganizations of America\\'s new army. There German soldiers who had been\\r\\nhardened and trained under German conscription before the war, and who\\r\\nhad learned new arts in their bloody trade, through their service in the\\r\\nWorld War, met their masters in young Americans taken from the shop, the\\r\\nfield, and the forge, youths who had been sent into battle with a scant\\r\\nsix months\\' intensive training in the art of war. Not only did these\\r\\nAmerican soldiers hold the German onslaught where it was but, in a\\r\\nsudden, fierce, resistless counter-thrust they drove back in defeat and\\r\\nconfusion the Prussian Guard, the Pommeranian Reserves, and smashed the\\r\\nmorale of that German division beyond hope of resurrection.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe news of that exploit sped from the Alps to the North Sea Coast,\\r\\nthrough all the camps of the Allies, with incredible rapidity. \"The\\r\\nAmericans have held the Germans. They can fight,\" ran the message. New\\r\\nlife came into the war-weary ranks of heroic poilus and into the\\r\\nsteel-hard armies of Great Britain. \"The Americans are as good as the\\r\\nbest. There are millions of them, and millions more are coming,\" was\\r\\nheard on every side. The transfusion of American blood came as magic\\r\\ntonic, and from that glorious day there was never a doubt as to the\\r\\nspeedy defeat of Germany. From that day the German retreat dated. The\\r\\narmistice signed on November 11, 1918, was merely the period finishing\\r\\nthe death sentence of German militarism, the first word of which was\\r\\nuttered at Chateau-Thierry.\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany\\'s defiance to the world, her determination to force her will and\\r\\nher \"kultur\" upon the democracies of earth, produced the conflict. She\\r\\ncalled to her aid three sister autocracies: Turkey, a land ruled by the\\r\\nwhims of a long line of moody misanthropic monarchs; Bulgaria, the\\r\\ntraitor nation cast by its Teutonic king into a war in which its people\\r\\nhad no choice and little sympathy; Austria-Hungary, a congeries of races\\r\\nin which a Teutonic minority ruled with an iron scepter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgainst this phalanx of autocracy, twenty-four nations arrayed\\r\\nthemselves. Populations of these twenty-eight warring nations far\\r\\nexceeded the total population of all the remainder of humanity. The\\r\\nconflagration of war literally belted the earth. It consumed the most\\r\\ncivilized of capitals. It raged in the swamps and forests of Africa. To\\r\\nits call came alien peoples speaking words that none but themselves\\r\\ncould translate, wearing garments of exotic cut and hue amid the smart\\r\\ngarbs and sober hues of modern civilization. A twentieth century Babel\\r\\ncame to the fields of France for freedom\\'s sake, and there was born an\\r\\ninternationalism making for the future understanding and peace of the\\r\\nworld.

If we divide the human races into white,\\r\\nyellow, red and black, all four were largely represented. Among the\\r\\nwhite races there were Frenchmen, Italians, Portuguese, English,\\r\\nScottish, Welsh, Irish, Canadians, Australians, South Africans (of both\\r\\nBritish and Dutch descent) New Zealanders; in the American army,\\r\\nprobably every other European nation was represented, with additional\\r\\ncontingents from those already named, so that every branch of the white\\r\\nrace figured in the ethnological total.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were representatives of many Asiatic races, including not only the\\r\\nvolunteers from the native states of India, but elements from the French\\r\\ncolony in Cochin China, with Annam, Cambodia, Tonkin, Laos, and Kwang\\r\\nChau Wan. England and France both contributed many African tribes,\\r\\nincluding Arabs from Algeria and Tunis, Senegalese, Saharans, and many\\r\\nof the South African races. The red races of North America were\\r\\nrepresented in the armies of both Canada and the United States, while\\r\\nthe Maoris, Samoans, and other Polynesian races were likewise\\r\\nrepresented. And as, in the American Army, there were men of German,\\r\\nAustrian, and Hungarian descent, and, in all probability, contingents\\r\\nalso of Bulgarian and Turkish blood, it may be said that Foch commanded\\r\\nan army representing the whole human race, united in defense of the\\r\\nideals of the Allies.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will be seen that more than ten times the number of neutral persons\\r\\nwere engulfed in the maelstrom of war. Millions of these suffered from\\r\\nit during the entire period of the conflict, four years three months and\\r\\nfifteen days, a total of 1,567 days. For almost four years Germany\\r\\nrolled up a record of victories on land and of piracies on and under the\\r\\nseas.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: TERRITORY OCCUPIED BY THE ALLIES UNDER THE ARMISTICE OF\\r\\nNOVEMBER 11, 1918 (East/West: Brussels to Berlin; North South: Keil to\\r\\nBern)]\\r\\n  Dotted area, invaded territory of Belgium, France, Luxembourg and\\r\\n  Alsace-Lorraine to be evacuated in fourteen days; area in small\\r\\n  squares, part of Germany west of the Rhine to be evacuated in\\r\\n  twenty-five days and occupied by Allied and U. S. troops; lightly\\r\\n  shaded area to east of Rhine, neutral zone; black semi-circles\\r\\n  bridge-heads of thirty kilometers radius in the neutral zone to be\\r\\n  occupied by Allied armies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle by little, day after day, piracies dwindled as the murderous\\r\\nsubmarine was mastered and its menace strangled. On the land, the\\r\\nAllies, under the matchless leadership of Marshal Ferdinand Foch and the\\r\\ngenerous co-operation of Americans, British, French and Italians, under\\r\\nthe great Generals Pershing, Haig, Petain and Diaz, wrested the\\r\\ninitiative from von Hindenburg and Ludendorf, late in July, 1918. Then,\\r\\nin one hundred and fifteen days of wonderful strategy and the fiercest\\r\\nfighting the world has ever witnessed, Foch and the Allies closed upon\\r\\nthe Germanic armies the jaws of a steel trap. A series of brilliant\\r\\nmaneuvers dating from the battle of Chateau-Thierry in which the\\r\\nAmericans checked the Teutonic rush, resulted in the defeat and rout on\\r\\nall the fronts of the Teutonic commands.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn that titanic effort, America\\'s share was that of the final deciding\\r\\nfactor. A nation unjustly titled the \"Dollar Nation,\" believed by\\r\\nGermany and by other countries to be soft, selfish and wasteful, became\\r\\nover night hard as tempered steel, self-sacrificing with an altruism\\r\\nthat inspired the world and thrifty beyond all precedent in order that\\r\\nnot only its own armies but the armies of the Allies might be fed and\\r\\nmunitioned.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeading American thought and American action, President Wilson stood out\\r\\nas the prophet of the democracies of the world. Not only did he inspire\\r\\nAmerica and the Allies to a military and naval effort beyond precedent,\\r\\nbut he inspired the civilian populations of the world to extraordinary\\r\\neffort, efforts that eventually won the war. For the decision was gained\\r\\nquite as certainly on the wheat fields of Western America, in the shops\\r\\nand the mines and the homes of America as it was upon the battle-field.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis effort came in response to the following appeal by the President:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThese, then, are the things we must do, and do well, besides\\r\\nfighting--the things without which mere fighting would be fruitless:\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must supply abundant food for ourselves and for our armies and our\\r\\nseamen not only, but also for a large part of the nations with whom we\\r\\nhave now made common cause, in whose support and by whose sides we shall\\r\\nbe fighting;\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must supply ships by the hundreds out of our shipyards to carry to\\r\\nthe other side of the sea, submarines or no submarines, what will every\\r\\nday be needed there; and--\\r\\n\\r\\nAbundant materials out of our fields and our mines and our factories\\r\\nwith which not only to clothe and equip our own forces on land and sea\\r\\nbut also to clothe and support our people for whom the gallant fellows\\r\\nunder arms can no longer work, to help clothe and equip the armies with\\r\\nwhich we are co-operating in Europe, and to keep the looms and\\r\\nmanufactories there in raw material;\\r\\n\\r\\nCoal to keep the fires going in ships at sea and in the furnaces of\\r\\nhundreds of factories across the sea;\\r\\n\\r\\nSteel out of which to make arms and ammunition both here and there;\\r\\n\\r\\nRails for worn-out railways back of the fighting fronts;\\r\\n\\r\\nLocomotives and rolling stock to take the place of those every day going\\r\\nto pieces;\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything with which the people of England and France and Italy and\\r\\nRussia have usually supplied themselves, but cannot now afford the men,\\r\\nthe materials, or the machinery to make.\\r\\n\\r\\nI particularly appeal to the farmers of the South to plant abundant\\r\\nfoodstuffs as well as cotton. They can show their patriotism in no\\r\\nbetter or more convincing way than by resisting the great temptation of\\r\\nthe present price of cotton and helping, helping upon a large scale, to\\r\\nfeed the nation and the peoples everywhere who are fighting for their\\r\\nliberties and for our own. The variety of their crops will be the\\r\\nvisible measure of their comprehension of their national duty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe response was amazing in its enthusiastic and general compliance. No\\r\\nautocracy issuing a ukase could have been obeyed so explicitly. Not only\\r\\ndid the various classes of workers and individuals observe the\\r\\nPresident\\'s suggestions to the letter, but they yielded up individual\\r\\nright after right in order that the war work of the government might be\\r\\nexpedited. Extraordinary powers and functions were granted by the people\\r\\nthrough Congress, and it was not until peace was declared that these\\r\\nrights and powers returned to the people.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese governmental activities ceased functioning after the war:\\r\\nFood administration;\\r\\nFuel administration;\\r\\nEspionage act;\\r\\nWar trade board;\\r\\nAlien property custodian (with extension of time for certain duties);\\r\\nAgricultural stimulation;\\r\\nHousing construction (except for shipbuilders);\\r\\nControl of telegraphs and telephones;\\r\\nExport control.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese functions were extended:\\r\\nControl over railroads: to cease within twenty-one months after the\\r\\nproclamation of peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe War Finance Corporation: to cease to function six months after the\\r\\nwar, with further time for liquidation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Capital Issues Committee: to terminate in six months after the peace\\r\\nproclamation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Aircraft Board: to end in six months after peace was proclaimed; and\\r\\nthe government operation of ships, within five years after the war was\\r\\nofficially ended.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Wilson, generally acclaimed as the leader of the world\\'s\\r\\ndemocracies, phrased for civilization the arguments against autocracy in\\r\\nthe great peace conference after the war. The President headed the\\r\\nAmerican delegation to that conclave of world re-construction. With him\\r\\nas delegates to the conference were Robert Lansing, Secretary of State;\\r\\nHenry White, former Ambassador to France and Italy; Edward M. House and\\r\\nGeneral Tasker H. Bliss.\\r\\n\\r\\nRepresenting American Labor at the International Labor conference held\\r\\nin Paris simultaneously with the Peace Conference were Samuel Gompers,\\r\\npresident of the American Federation of Labor; William Green,\\r\\nsecretary-treasurer of the United Mine Workers of America; John R.\\r\\nAlpine, president of the Plumbers\\' Union; James Duncan, president of the\\r\\nInternational Association of Granite Cutters; Frank Duffy, president of\\r\\nthe United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, and Frank Morrison,\\r\\nsecretary of the American Federation of Labor.\\r\\n\\r\\nEstimating the share of each Allied nation in the great victory, mankind\\r\\nwill conclude that the heaviest cost in proportion to prewar population\\r\\nand treasure was paid by the nations that first felt the shock of war,\\r\\nBelgium, Serbia, Poland and France. All four were the battle-grounds of\\r\\nhuge armies, oscillating in a bloody frenzy over once fertile fields and\\r\\nonce prosperous towns.\\r\\n\\r\\nBelgium, with a population of 8,000,000, had a casualty list of more\\r\\nthan 350,000; France, with its casualties of 4,000,000 out of a\\r\\npopulation (including its colonies) of 90,000,000, is really the martyr\\r\\nnation of the world. Her gallant poilus showed the world how cheerfully\\r\\nmen may die in defense of home and liberty. Huge Russia, including\\r\\nhapless Poland, had a casualty list of 7,000,000 out of its entire\\r\\npopulation of 180,000,000. The United States out of a population of\\r\\n110,000,000 had a casualty list of 236,117 for nineteen months of war;\\r\\nof these 53,169 were killed or died of disease; 179,625 were wounded;\\r\\nand 3,323 prisoners or missing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: KINGS AND CHIEF EXECUTIVES OF THE PRINCIPAL POWERS\\r\\nASSOCIATED AGAINST THE GERMAN ALLIANCE (King George V of England,\\r\\nPresident Raymond of France, President Woodrow Wilson of the United\\r\\nStates, King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy, King Albert I of Belgium)]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph of Clemenceau]\\r\\n  Copyright International Film Service.\\r\\n  THE \"TIGER\" OF FRANCE\\r\\n  George Benjamin Eugene Clemenceau, world-famous Premier of France, who\\r\\n  by his inspiring leadership maintained the magnificent morale of his\\r\\n  countrymen in the face of terrific assaults of the enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: THE RIGHT HONORABLE DAVID LLOYD GEORGE]\\r\\n  British Premier, who headed the coalition cabinet which carried\\r\\n  England through the war to victory.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: KING GEORGE V]\\r\\n  King of Great Britain and Ireland and Emperor of India, who struggled\\r\\n  earnestly to prevent the war, but when Germany attacked Belgium sent\\r\\n  the mighty forces of the British Empire to stop the Hun.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the glory of Great Britain must be recorded the enormous effort made\\r\\nby its people, showing through operations of its army and navy. The\\r\\nBritish Empire, including, the Colonies, had a casualty list of\\r\\n3,049,992 men out of a total population of 440,000,000. Of these 658,665\\r\\nwere killed; 2,032,122 were wounded, and 359,204 were reported missing.\\r\\nIt raised an army of 7,000,000, and fought seven separate foreign\\r\\ncampaigns, in France, Italy, Dardanelles, Mesopotamia, Macedonia, East\\r\\nAfrica and Egypt. It raised its navy personnel from 115,000 to 450,000\\r\\nmen. Co-operating with its allies on the sea, it destroyed approximately\\r\\none hundred and fifty German and Austrian submarines. It aided\\r\\nmaterially the American navy and transport service in sending overseas\\r\\nthe great American army whose coming decided the war. The British navy\\r\\nand transport service during the war made the following record of\\r\\ntransportation and convoy:\\r\\n\\r\\nTwenty million men, 2,000,000 horses, 130,000,000 tons of food,\\r\\n25,000,000 tons of explosives and supplies, 51,000,000 tons of oil and\\r\\nfuels, 500,000 vehicles. In 1917 alone 7,000,000 men, 500,000 animals,\\r\\n200,000 vehicles and 9,500,000 tons of stores were conveyed to the\\r\\nseveral war fronts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German losses were estimated at 1,588,000 killed or died of disease;\\r\\n4,000,000 wounded; and 750,000 prisoners and missing.\\r\\n\\r\\nA tabulation of the estimates of casualties and the money cost of the\\r\\nwar reveals the enormous price paid by humanity to convince a\\r\\nmilitary-mad Germanic caste that Right and not Might must hereafter rule\\r\\nthe world.

Was the cost\\r\\ntoo heavy? Was the price of international liberty paid in human lives\\r\\nand in sacrifices untold too great for the peace that followed?\\r\\n\\r\\nEven the most practical of money changers, the most sentimental\\r\\npacifist, viewing the cost in connection with the liberation of whole\\r\\nnations, with the spread of enlightened liberty through oppressed and\\r\\nbenighted lands, with the destruction of autocracy, of the military\\r\\ncaste, and of Teutonic kultur in its materialistic aspect, must agree\\r\\nthat the blood was well shed, the treasure well spent.\\r\\n\\r\\nMillions of gallant, eager youths learned how to die fearlessly and\\r\\ngloriously. They died to teach vandal nations that nevermore will\\r\\nhumanity permit the exploitation of peoples for militaristic purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Milton, the great philosopher poet, phrased the lesson taught to\\r\\nGermany on the fields of France:\\r\\n\\r\\nThey err who count it glorious to subdue\\r\\nBy conquest far and wide, to overrun\\r\\nLarge countries, and in field great battles win,\\r\\nGreat cities by assault; what do these worthies\\r\\nBut rob and spoil, burn, slaughter, and enslave\\r\\nPeaceable nations, neighboring or remote\\r\\nMade captive, yet deserving freedom more\\r\\nThan those their conquerors, who leave behind\\r\\nNothing but ruin wheresoe\\'er they rove\\r\\nAnd all the flourishing works of peace destroy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WORLD SUDDENLY TURNED UPSIDE DOWN\\r\\n\\r\\nDemoralization, like the black plague of the middle ages, spread in\\r\\nevery direction immediately following the first overt acts of war. Men\\r\\nwho were millionaires at nightfall awoke the next morning to find\\r\\nthemselves bankrupt through depreciation of their stock-holdings.\\r\\nProsperous firms of importers were put out of business. International\\r\\ncommerce was dislocated to an extent unprecedented in history.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe greatest of hardships immediately following the war, however, were\\r\\nvisited upon those who unhappily were caught on their vacations or on\\r\\ntheir business trips within the area affected by the war. Not only men,\\r\\nbut women and children, were subjected to privations of the severest\\r\\ncharacter. Notes which had been negotiable, paper money of every\\r\\ndescription, and even silver currency suddenly became of little value.\\r\\nAmericans living in hotels and pensions facing this sudden shrinkage in\\r\\ntheir money, were compelled to leave the roofs that had sheltered them.\\r\\nThat which was true of Americans was true of all other nationalities, so\\r\\nthat every embassy and the office of every consul became a miniature\\r\\nBabel of excited, distressed humanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sudden seizure of railroads for war purposes in Germany, France,\\r\\nAustria and Russia, cut off thousands of travelers in villages that were\\r\\nalmost inaccessible. Europeans being comparatively close to their homes,\\r\\nwere not in straits as severe as the Americans whose only hope for aid\\r\\nlay in the speedy arrival of American gold. Prices of food soared beyond\\r\\nall precedent and many of these hapless strangers went under. Paris, the\\r\\nbrightest and gayest city in Europe, suddenly became the most somber of\\r\\ndwelling places. No traffic was permitted on the highways at night. No\\r\\nlights were permitted and all the cafes were closed at eight o\\'clock.\\r\\nThe gay capital was placed under iron military rule.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeaports, and especially the pleasure resorts in France, Belgium and\\r\\nEngland, were placed under a military supervision. Visitors were ordered\\r\\nto return to their homes and every resort was shrouded with darkness at\\r\\nnight. The records of those early days are filled with stories of\\r\\ndramatic happenings.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the night of July 31st Jean Leon Jaures, the famous leader of French\\r\\nSocialists, was assassinated while dining in a small restaurant near the\\r\\nParis Bourse. His assassin was Raoul Villein. Jaures had been\\r\\nendeavoring to accomplish a union of French and German Socialists with\\r\\nthe aim of preventing the war. The object of the assassination appeared\\r\\nto have been wholly political.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the same day stock exchanges throughout the United States were\\r\\nclosed, following the example of European stock exchanges. Ship\\r\\ninsurance soared to prohibitive figures. Reservists of the French and\\r\\nGerman armies living outside of their native land were called to the\\r\\ncolors and their homeward rush still further complicated transportation\\r\\nfor civilians. All the countries of Europe clamored for gold. North and\\r\\nSouth America complied with the demand by sending cargoes of the\\r\\nprecious metal overseas. The German ship Kron Prinzessin with a cargo of\\r\\ngold, attempted to make the voyage to Hamburg, but a wireless warning\\r\\nthat Allied cruisers were waiting for it off the Grand Banks of\\r\\nNewfoundland, compelled the big ship to turn back to safety in America.\\r\\n\\r\\nChannel boats bearing American refugees from the Continent to London\\r\\nwere described as floating hells. London was excited over the war and\\r\\nholiday spirit, and overrun with five thousand citizens of the United\\r\\nStates tearfully pleading with the American Ambassador for money for\\r\\ntransportation home or assurances of personal safety.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe condition of the terror-stricken tourists fleeing to the friendly\\r\\nshores of England from Continental countries crowded with soldiers\\r\\ndragging in their wake heavy guns, resulted in an extraordinary\\r\\ngathering of two thousand Americans at a hotel one afternoon and the\\r\\nformation of a preliminary organization to afford relief. Some people\\r\\nwho attended the meeting were already beginning to feel the pinch of\\r\\nwant with little prospects of immediate succor. One man and wife, with\\r\\nfour children, had six cents when he appealed to Ambassador Page after\\r\\nan exciting escape from German territory.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: WHERE THE WORLD WAR BEGAN.

Women hugging newspaper bundles containing\\r\\nexpensive Paris frocks and millinery were herded in third-class\\r\\ncarriages and compelled to stand many hours. They reached London utterly\\r\\nfatigued and unkempt, but mainly cheerful, only to find the hotels\\r\\nchoked with fellow countrymen fortunate to reach there sooner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ambassador was harassed by anxious women and children who asked many\\r\\nabsurd questions which he could not answer. He said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The appeals of these people are most distressing. They are very much\\r\\nexcited, and no small wonder. I regret I have no definite news of the\\r\\nprospects or plans of the government for relief. I have communicated\\r\\ntheir condition to the Department of State and expect a response and\\r\\nassurances of coming aid as soon as possible. That the government will\\r\\nact I have not the slightest doubt. I am confident that Washington will\\r\\ndo everything in her power for relief. How soon, I cannot tell. I have\\r\\nheard many distressing tales during the last forty-eight hours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA crowd filled the Ambassador\\'s office on the first floor of the flat\\r\\nbuilding, in Victoria Street, which was mainly composed of women, school\\r\\nteachers, art students, and other persons doing Europe on a shoestring.\\r\\nMany were entirely out of money and with limited securities, which were\\r\\nnot negotiable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe action of the British Government extending the bank holiday till\\r\\nThursday of that week was discouraging news for the new arrivals from\\r\\nthe Continent, as it was uncertain whether the express and steamship\\r\\ncompanies would open in the morning for the cashing of checks and the\\r\\ndelivery of mail, as was announced the previous Saturday.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoctors J. Riddle Goffe, of New York; Frank F. Simpson, of Pittsburgh;\\r\\nArthur D. Ballon of Vistaburg, Mich., and B. F. Martin, of Chicago,\\r\\nformed themselves into a committee, and asked the co-operation of the\\r\\npress in America to bring about adequate assistance for the marooned\\r\\nAmericans, and to urge the bankers of the United States to insist on\\r\\ntheir letters of credit and travelers\\' checks being honored so far as\\r\\npossible by the agents in Europe upon whom they were drawn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: THE CATHEDRAL OF RHEIMS]\\r\\n  In the first weeks of the war the Germans occupied Rheims, but were\\r\\n  driven out after von Kluck\\'s retreat.

From left to right they are: The Kaiser,\\r\\n  Crown Prince Wilhelm, Princes Eitel Friedrich, Adalbert, August, Oscar\\r\\n  and Joachim.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Martin and Dr. Simpson, who left London on Saturday for Switzerland\\r\\nto fetch back a young American girl, were unable to get beyond Paris,\\r\\nand they returned to London. Everywhere they found trains packed with\\r\\nrefugees whose only object in life apparently was to reach the channel\\r\\nboats, accepting cheerfully the discomforts of those vessels if only\\r\\nable to get out of the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nRev. J. P. Garfield, of Claremore, N. H., gave the following account of\\r\\nhis experiences in Holland:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On sailing from the Hook of Holland near midnight we pulled out just as\\r\\nthe boat train from The Hague arrived. The steamer paused, but as she\\r\\nwas filled to her capacity she later continued on her voyage, leaving\\r\\nfully two hundred persons marooned on the wharf.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Our discomforts while crossing the North Sea were great. Every seat was\\r\\nfilled with sleepers, the cabins were given to women and children. The\\r\\ncrowd, as a rule, was helpful and kindly, the single men carrying the\\r\\nbabies and people lending money to those without funds. Despite the\\r\\nrefugee conditions prevailing it was noticeable that many women on the\\r\\nHook wharf clung tenaciously to bandboxes containing Parisian hats.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTravelers from Cologne said that searchlights were operated from the\\r\\ntops of the hotels all night searching for airplanes, and machine guns\\r\\nwere mounted on the famous Cologne Cathedral. They also reported that\\r\\ntourists were refused hotel accommodations at Frankfort because they\\r\\nwere without cash.\\r\\n\\r\\nMen, women and children sat in the streets all night. The trains were\\r\\nstopped several miles from the German frontier and the passengers,\\r\\nespecially the women and children, suffered great hardship being forced\\r\\nto continue their journey on foot.\\r\\n\\r\\nPassengers arriving at London from Montreal on the Cunard Line steamer\\r\\nAndania, bound for Southampton, reported the vessel was met at sea by a\\r\\nBritish torpedo boat and ordered by wireless to stop. The liner then was\\r\\nled into Plymouth as a matter of precaution against mines. Plymouth was\\r\\nfilled with soldiers and searchlights were seen constantly flashing\\r\\nabout the harbor.\\r\\n\\r\\nOtis B. Kent, an attorney for the Interstate Commerce Commission, of\\r\\nWashington, arrived in London after an exciting journey from Petrograd.\\r\\nUnable to find accommodations at a hotel he slept on the railway station\\r\\nfloor. He said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had been on a trip to Sweden to see the midnight sun. I did not\\r\\nrealize the gravity of the situation until I saw the Russian fleet\\r\\ncleared for action. This was only July 26th, at Kronstadt, where the\\r\\nshipyards were working overtime.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I arrived at the Russian capital on the following day. Enormous\\r\\ndemonstrations were taking place. I was warned to get out and left on\\r\\nthe night of the 28th for Berlin. I saw Russian soldiers drilling at the\\r\\nstations and artillery constantly on the move.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At Berlin I was warned to keep off the streets for fear of being\\r\\nmistaken for an Englishmen. At Hamburg the number of warnings was\\r\\nincreased. Two Russians who refused to rise in a cafe when the German\\r\\nanthem was played were attacked and badly beaten. I also saw two\\r\\nEnglishmen attacked in the street, but they finally were rescued by the\\r\\npolice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There was a harrowing scene when the Hamburg-American Line steamer\\r\\nImperator canceled its sailing. She left stranded three thousand\\r\\npassengers, most of them short of money, and the women wailing. About\\r\\none hundred and fifty of us were given passage in the second class of\\r\\nthe American Line steamship Philadelphia, for which I was offered $400\\r\\nby a speculator.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The journey to Flushing was made in a packed train, its occupants\\r\\nlacking sleep and food. No trouble was encountered on the frontier.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTheodore Hetzler, of the Fifth Avenue Bank, was appointed chairman of\\r\\nthe meeting for preliminary relief of the stranded tourists, and\\r\\ncommittees were named to interview officials of the steamship companies\\r\\nand of the hotels, to search for lost baggage, to make arrangements for\\r\\nthe honoring of all proper checks and notes, and to confer with the\\r\\nmembers of the American embassy.\\r\\n\\r\\nOscar Straus, who arrived from Paris, said that the United States\\r\\nembassy there was working hard to get Americans out of France. Great\\r\\nenthusiasm prevailed at the French capital, he said, owing to the\\r\\nannouncement that the United States Government was considering a plan to\\r\\nsend transports to take Americans home.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following committees were appointed at the meeting:\\r\\n\\r\\nFinance--Theodore Hetzler, Fred I. Kent and James G. Cannon;\\r\\nTransportation--Joseph F. Day, Francis M. Weld and George D. Smith, all\\r\\nof New York; Diplomatic--Oscar S. Straus, Walter L. Fisher and James\\r\\nByrne; Hotels--L. H. Armour, of Chicago, and Thomas J. Shanley, New\\r\\nYork.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe committee established headquarters where Americans might register\\r\\nand obtain assistance. Chandler Anderson, a member of the International\\r\\nClaims Commission, arrived in London from Paris. He said he had been\\r\\nengaged with the work of the commission at Versailles, when he was\\r\\nwarned by the American embassy that he had better leave France. He acted\\r\\npromptly on this advice and the commission was adjourned until after the\\r\\nwar. Mr. Anderson had to leave his baggage behind him because the\\r\\nrailway company would not register it. He said the city of Paris\\r\\npresented a strange contrast to the ordinary animation prevailing there.\\r\\nMost of the shops were closed. There were no taxis in the streets, and\\r\\nonly a few vehicles drawn by horses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe armored cruiser Tennessee, converted for the time being into a\\r\\ntreasure ship, left New York on the night of August 6th, 1914, to carry\\r\\n$7,500,000 in gold to the many thousand Americans who were in want in\\r\\nEuropean countries. Included in the $7,500,000 was $2,500,000\\r\\nappropriated by the government. Private consignments in gold in sums\\r\\nfrom $1,000 to $5,000 were accepted by Colonel Smith, of the army\\r\\nquartermaster\\'s department, who undertook their delivery to Americans in\\r\\nParis and other European ports.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cruiser carried as passengers Ambassador Willard, who returned to\\r\\nhis post at Madrid, and army and naval officers assigned as military\\r\\nobservers in Europe. On the return trip accommodations for 200 Americans\\r\\nwere available.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dreadnaught Florida, after being hastily coaled and provisioned,\\r\\nleft the Brooklyn Navy Yard under sealed orders at 9.30 o\\'clock the\\r\\nmorning of August 6th and proceeded to Tompkinsville, where she dropped\\r\\nanchor near the Tennessee.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Florida was sent to protect the neutrality of American ports and\\r\\nprohibit supplies to belligerent ships. Secretary Daniels ordered her to\\r\\nwatch the port of New York and sent the Mayflower to Hampton Roads.\\r\\nDestroyers guarded ports along the New England coast and those at Lewes,\\r\\nDel., to prevent violations of neutrality at Philadelphia and in that\\r\\nterritory. Any vessel that attempted to sail for a belligerent port\\r\\nwithout clearance papers was boarded by American officials.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Texas and Louisiana, at Vera Cruz and the Minnesota, at Tampico,\\r\\nwere ordered to New York, and Secretary Daniels announced that other\\r\\nAmerican vessels would be ordered north as fast as room could be found\\r\\nfor them in navy yard docks.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt wireless stations, under the censorship ordered by the President, no\\r\\ncode messages were allowed in any circumstances. Messages which might\\r\\nhelp any of the belligerents in any way were barred.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe torpedo-boat destroyer Warrington and the revenue cutter\\r\\nAndroscoggin arrived at Bar Harbor on August 6th, to enforce neutrality\\r\\nregulations and allowed no foreign ships to leave Frenchman\\'s Bay\\r\\nwithout clearance papers. The United States cruiser Milwaukee sailed the\\r\\nsame day from the Puget Sound Navy Yard to form part of the coast patrol\\r\\nto enforce neutrality regulations.\\r\\n\\r\\nArrangements were made in Paris by Myron T. Herrick, the American\\r\\nAmbassador, acting under instructions from Washington, to take over the\\r\\naffairs of the German embassy, while Alexander H. Thackara, the American\\r\\nConsul General, looked after the affairs of the German consulate.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Poincare and the members of the French cabinet later issued a\\r\\njoint proclamation to the French nation in which was the phrase\\r\\n\"mobilization is not war.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe marching of the soldiers in the streets with the English, Russian\\r\\nand French flags flying, the singing of patriotic songs and the shouting\\r\\nof \"On to Berlin!\" were much less remarkable than the general demeanor\\r\\nand cold resolution of most of the people.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe response to the order of mobilization was instant, and the stations\\r\\nof all the railways, particularly those leading to the eastward, were\\r\\ncrowded with reservists. Many women accompanied the men until close to\\r\\nthe stations, where, softly crying, farewells were said. The troop\\r\\ntrains left at frequent intervals. All the automobile busses\\r\\ndisappeared, having been requisitioned by the army to carry meat, the\\r\\ncoachwork of the vehicles being removed and replaced with specially\\r\\ndesigned bodies. A large number of taxicabs, private automobiles and\\r\\nhorses and carts also were taken over by the military for transport\\r\\npurposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wildest enthusiasm was manifested on the boulevards when the news of\\r\\nthe ordering of the mobilization became known. Bodies of men formed into\\r\\nregular companies in ranks ten deep, paraded the streets waving the\\r\\ntricolor and other national emblems and cheering and singing the\\r\\n\"Marseillaise\" and the \"Internationale,\" at the same time throwing their\\r\\nhats in the air. On the sidewalks were many weeping women and children.\\r\\nAll the stores and cafes were deserted.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll foreigners were compelled to leave Paris or France before the end of\\r\\nthe first day of mobilization by train but not by automobile. Time\\r\\ntables were posted on the walls of Paris giving the times of certain\\r\\ntrains on which these people might leave the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican citizens or British subjects were allowed to remain in France,\\r\\nexcept in the regions on the eastern frontier and near certain\\r\\nfortresses, provided they made declaration to the police and obtained a\\r\\nspecial permit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to Italy\\'s situation, Rome was quite calm and the normal aspect made\\r\\ntourists decide that Italy was the safest place. Austria\\'s note to\\r\\nSerbia was issued without consulting Italy. One point of the Triple\\r\\nAlliance provided that no member should take action in the Balkans\\r\\nbefore an agreement with the other allies. Such an agreement did not\\r\\ntake place. The alliance was of defensive, not aggressive, character and\\r\\ncould not force an ally to follow any enterprise taken on the sole\\r\\naccount and without a notice, as such action taken by Austria against\\r\\nSerbia. It was felt even then that Italy would eventually cast its lot\\r\\nwith the Entente Allies.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecretary of the Treasury William G. McAdoo; John Skelton Williams,\\r\\nComptroller of the Currency; Charles S. Hamblin and William P. G.\\r\\nHarding, members of the Federal Reserve Board, went to New York early in\\r\\nAugust, 1914, where they discussed relief measures with a group of\\r\\nleading bankers at what was regarded as the most momentous conference of\\r\\nthe kind held in the country in recent years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New York Clearing House Committee, on August 2d, called a meeting of\\r\\nthe Clearing House Association, to arrange for the immediate issuance of\\r\\nclearing house certificates. Among those at the conference were J. P.\\r\\nMorgan and his partner, Henry P. Davison; Frank A. Vanderlip, president\\r\\nof the National City Bank, and A. Barton Hepburn, chairman of the Chase\\r\\nNational Bank.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III\\r\\n\\r\\nWHY THE WORLD WENT TO WAR\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile it is true that the war was conceived in Berlin, it is none the\\r\\nless true that it was born in the Balkans. It is necessary in order that\\r\\nwe may view with correct perspective the background of the World War,\\r\\nthat we gain some notion of the Balkan States and the complications\\r\\nentering into their relations. These countries have been the adopted\\r\\nchildren of the great European powers during generations of rulers.\\r\\nRussia assumed guardianship of the nations having a preponderance of\\r\\nSlavic blood; Roumania with its Latin consanguinities was close to\\r\\nFrance and Italy; Bulgaria, Greece, and Balkan Turkey were debatable\\r\\nregions wherein the diplomats of the rival nations secured temporary\\r\\nvictories by devious methods.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Balkans have fierce hatreds and have been the site of sudden\\r\\nhistoric wars. At the time of the declaration of the World War, the\\r\\nBalkan nations were living under the provisions of the Treaty of\\r\\nBucharest, dated August 10, 1913. Greece, Roumania, Bulgaria, Serbia and\\r\\nMontenegro were signers, and Turkey acquiesced in its provisions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: PROVISIONS OF THE TREATY OF BUCHAREST, 1913. (Map showing\\r\\nthe Adriatic on the West, the Black Sea on the East, Roumania on the\\r\\nNorth and Crete on the South. Cross hatching show land allocations\\r\\namong Serbia, Montenegro, Greece, Bulgaria and Roumania.)]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe assassination at Sarajevo had sent a convulsive shudder throughout\\r\\nthe Balkans. The reason lay in the century-old antagonism between the\\r\\nSlav and the Teuton. Serbia, Montenegro and Russia had never forgiven\\r\\nAustria for seizing Bosnia and Herzegovina and making these Slavic\\r\\npeople subjects of the Austrian crown. Bulgaria, Roumania and Turkey\\r\\nremained cold at the news of the assassination. German diplomacy was in\\r\\nthe ascendant at these courts and the prospect of war with Germany as\\r\\ntheir great ally presented no terrors for them. The sympathies of the\\r\\npeople of Greece were with Serbia, but the Grecian Court, because the\\r\\nQueen of Greece was the only sister of the German Kaiser, was whole\\r\\nheartedly with Austria. Perhaps at the first the Roumanians were most\\r\\nnearly neutral. They believed strongly that each of the small nations of\\r\\nthe Balkan region as well as all of the small nations that had been\\r\\nabsorbed but had not been digested by Austria, should cut itself from\\r\\nthe leading strings held by the large European powers. There was a\\r\\ndistinct undercurrent, for a federation resembling that of the United\\r\\nStates of America between these peoples. This was expressed most clearly\\r\\nby M. Jonesco, leader of the Liberal party of Roumania and generally\\r\\nrecognized as the ablest statesman of middle Europe. He declared:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I always believed, and still believe, that the Balkan States cannot\\r\\nsecure their future otherwise than by a close understanding among\\r\\nthemselves, whether this understanding shall or shall not take the form\\r\\nof a federation. No one of the Balkan States is strong enough to resist\\r\\nthe pressure from one or another of the European powers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For this reason I am deeply grieved to see in the Balkan coalition of\\r\\n1912 Roumania not invited. If Roumania had taken part in the first one,\\r\\nwe should not have had the second. I did all that was in my power and\\r\\nsucceeded in preventing the war between Roumania and the Balkan League\\r\\nin the winter of 1912-13.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I risked my popularity, and I do not feel sorry for it. I employed all\\r\\nmy efforts to prevent the second Balkan war, which, as is well known,\\r\\nwas profitable to us. I repeatedly told the Bulgarians that they ought\\r\\nnot to enter it because in that case we would enter it too. But I was\\r\\nnot successful in my efforts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"During the second Balkan war I did all in my power to end it as quickly\\r\\nas possible. At the conference at Bucharest I made efforts, as Mr.\\r\\nPashich and Mr. Venizelos know very well, to secure for beaten Bulgaria\\r\\nthe best terms. My object was to obtain a new coalition of all the\\r\\nBalkan States, including Roumania. Had I succeeded in this the situation\\r\\nwould be much better. No reasonable man will deny that the Balkan States\\r\\nare neutralizing each other at the present time, which in itself makes\\r\\nthe whole situation all the more miserable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In October, 1913, when I succeeded in facilitating the conclusion of\\r\\npeace between Greece and Turkey, I was pursuing the same object of the\\r\\nBalkan coalition. On my return from Athens I endeavored, though without\\r\\nsuccess, to put the Greco-Turkish relations on a basis of friendship,\\r\\nbeing convinced that the well-understood interest of both countries lies\\r\\nnot only in friendly relations, but even in an alliance between them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The dissensions that exist between the Balkan States can be settled in\\r\\na friendly way without war. The best moment for this would be after the\\r\\ngeneral war, when the map of Europe will be remade. The Balkan country\\r\\nwhich would start war against another Balkan country would commit, not\\r\\nonly a crime against her own future, but an act of folly as well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The destiny and future of the Balkan States, and of all the small\\r\\nEuropean peoples as well, will not be regulated by fratricidal wars,\\r\\nbut, with this great European struggle, the real object of which is to\\r\\nsettle the question whether Europe shall enter an era of justice, and\\r\\ntherefore happiness for the small peoples, or whether we will face a\\r\\nperiod of oppression more or less gilt-edged. And as I always believed\\r\\nthat wisdom and truth will triumph in the end, I want to believe, too,\\r\\nthat, in spite of the pessimistic news reaching me from the different\\r\\nsides of the Balkan countries, there will be no war among them in order\\r\\nto justify those who do not believe in the vitality of the small\\r\\npeoples.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conference at Rome, April 10, 1918, to settle outstanding questions\\r\\nbetween the Italians and the Slavs of the Adriatic, drew attention to\\r\\nthose Slavonic peoples in Europe who were under non-Slavonic rule. At\\r\\nthe beginning of the war there were three great Slavonic groups in\\r\\nEurope: First, the Russians with the Little Russians, speaking languages\\r\\nnot more different than the dialect of Yorkshire is from the dialect of\\r\\nDevonshire; second, a central group, including the Poles, the Czechs or\\r\\nBohemians, the Moravians, and Slovaks, this group thus being separated\\r\\nunder the four crowns of Russia, Germany, Austria and Hungary; the\\r\\nthird, the southern group, included the Sclavonians, the Croatians, the\\r\\nDalmatians, Bosnians, Herzegovinians, the Slavs, generally called\\r\\nSlovenes, in the western part of Austria, down to Goritzia, and also the\\r\\ntwo independent kingdoms of Montenegro and Serbia.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike the central group, this southern group of Slavs was divided under\\r\\nfour crowns, Hungary, Austria, Montenegro, and Serbia; but, in spite of\\r\\nthe fact that half belong to the Western and half to the Eastern Church,\\r\\nthey are all essentially the same people, though with considerable\\r\\ninfusion of non-Slavonic blood, there being a good deal of Turkish blood\\r\\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina. The languages, however, are practically\\r\\nidentical, formed largely of pure Slavonic materials, and, curiously,\\r\\nmuch more closely connected with the eastern Slav group--Russia and\\r\\nLittle Russia--than with the central group, Polish and Bohemian. A\\r\\nRussian of Moscow will find it much easier to understand a Slovene from\\r\\nGoritzia than a Pole from Warsaw. The Ruthenians in southern Galicia and\\r\\nBukowina, are identical in race and speech with the Little Russians of\\r\\nUkrainia.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the central group, the Poles have generally inclined to Austria,\\r\\nwhich has always supported the Polish landlords of Galicia against the\\r\\nRuthenian peasantry; while the Czechs have been not so much\\r\\nanti-Austrian as anti-German. Indeed, the Hapsburg rulers have again and\\r\\nagain played these Slavs off against their German subjects. It was the\\r\\nSouthern Slav question as affecting Serbia and Austria, that gave the\\r\\npretext for the present war. The central Slav question affecting the\\r\\ndestiny of the Poles--was a bone of contention between Austria and\\r\\nGermany. It is the custom to call the Southern Slavs \"Jugoslavs\" from\\r\\nthe Slav word Yugo, \"south,\" but as this is a concession to German\\r\\ntransliteration, many prefer to write the word \"Yugoslav,\" which\\r\\nrepresents its pronunciation. The South Slav question was created by the\\r\\nincursions of three Asiatic peoples--Huns, Magyars, Turks--who broke up\\r\\nthe originally continuous Slav territory that ran from the White Sea to\\r\\nthe confines of Greece and the Adriatic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map: Austria-Hungary and surrounding nations]\\r\\n  THE MIXTURE OF RACES IN SOUTH CENTRAL EUROPE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph of three soldiers firing artillery.]\\r\\n  Copyright Underwood and Underwood, N.

Out of the hatreds engendered by the domination over the\\r\\nliberty-loving Slavic peoples by an arrogant Teutonic minority grew the\\r\\nassassinations at Sarajevo. These crimes were the expression of hatred\\r\\nnot for the heir apparent of Austria but for the Hapsburg and their\\r\\nGermanic associates.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy a twist of the wheel of fate, the same Slavic peoples whose\\r\\ndetermination to rid themselves of the Teutonic yoke, started the war,\\r\\nalso bore rather more than their share in the swift-moving events that\\r\\ndecided and closed the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nRussia, the dying giant among the great nations, championed the Slavic\\r\\npeoples at the beginning of the war. It entered the conflict in aid of\\r\\nlittle Serbia, but at the end Russia bowed to Germany in the infamous\\r\\npeace treaty at Brest-Litovsk. Thereafter during the last months of the\\r\\nwar Russia was virtually an ally of its ancient enemy, Turkey, the \"Sick\\r\\nMan of Europe,\" and the central German empires. With these allies the\\r\\nBolshevik government of Russia attempted to head off the Czecho-Slovak\\r\\nregiments that had been captured by Russia during its drive into Austria\\r\\nand had been imprisoned in Siberia. After the peace consummated at\\r\\nBrest-Litovsk, these regiments determined to fight on the side of the\\r\\nAllies and endeavored to make their way to the western front.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo war problems were more difficult than those of the Czecho-Slovaks.\\r\\nFew have been handled so masterfully. Surrounded by powerful enemies\\r\\nwhich for centuries have been bent on destroying every trace of Slavic\\r\\nculture, they had learned how to defend themselves against every trick\\r\\nor scheme of the brutal Germans.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Czecho-Slovak plan in Russia was of great value to the Allies all\\r\\nover the world, and was put at their service by Professor Thomas G.\\r\\nMasaryk. He went to Russia when everything was adrift and got hold of\\r\\nBohemian prisoners here and there and organized them into a compact\\r\\nlittle army of 50,000 to 60,000 men. Equipped and fed, he moved them to\\r\\nwhatever point had most power to thoroughly disrupt the German plans.\\r\\nThey did much to check the German army for months. They resolutely\\r\\nrefused to take any part in Russian political affairs, and when it\\r\\nseemed no longer possible to work effectively in Russia this remarkable\\r\\nlittle band started on a journey all round the world to get to the\\r\\nwestern front. They loyally gave up most of their arms under agreement\\r\\nwith Lenine and Trotzky that they might peacefully proceed out of Russia\\r\\nvia Vladivostok.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile they were carrying out their part of the agreement, and well on\\r\\nthe way, they were surprised by telegrams from Lenine and Trotzky to the\\r\\nSoviets in Siberia ordering them to take away their arms and intern\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story of what occurred then was told by two American engineers,\\r\\nEmerson and Hawkins, who, on the way to Ambassador Francis, and not\\r\\nbeing able to reach Vologda, joined a band of four or five thousand. The\\r\\nengineers were with them three months, while they were making it safe\\r\\nalong the lines of the railroad for the rest of the Czecho-Slovaks to\\r\\nget out, and incidentally for Siberians to resume peaceful occupations.\\r\\nThey were also supported by old railway organizations which had stuck\\r\\nbravely to them without wages and which every little while were \"shot\\r\\nup\" by the Bolsheviki.\\r\\n\\r\\nDistress in Russia would have been much more intense had it not been for\\r\\nthe loyalty of the railway men in sticking to their tasks. Some American\\r\\nengineers at Irkutsk, on a peaceful journey out of Russia, on descending\\r\\nfrom the cars were met with a demand to surrender, and shots from\\r\\nmachine guns. Some, fortunately, had kept hand grenades, and with these\\r\\nand a few rifles went straight at the machine guns. Although\\r\\noutnumbered, the attackers took the guns and soon afterward took the\\r\\ntown. The Czecho-Slovaks, in the beginning almost unarmed, went against\\r\\ngreat odds and won for themselves the right to be considered a nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeeing the treachery of Lenine and Trotzky, they went back toward the\\r\\nwest and made things secure for their men left behind. They took town\\r\\nafter town with the arms they first took away from the Bolsheviki and\\r\\nGermans; but in every town they immediately set up a government, with\\r\\nall the elements of normal life. They established police and sanitary\\r\\nsystems, opened hospitals, and had roads repaired, leaving a handful of\\r\\nmen in the midst of enemies to carry on the plans of their leaders.\\r\\nAmerican engineers speaking of the cleanliness of the Czecho-Slovak\\r\\narmy, said that they lived like Spartans.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole story is a remarkable evidence of the struggle of these little\\r\\npeople for self-government.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe emergence of the Czecho-Slovak nation has been one of the most\\r\\nremarkable and noteworthy features of the war. Out of the confusion of\\r\\nthe situation, with the possibility of the resurrection of oppressed\\r\\npeoples, something of the dignity of old Bohemia was comprehended, and\\r\\nit was recognized that the Czechs were to be rescued from Austria and\\r\\nthe Slovaks from Hungary, and united in one country with entire\\r\\nindependence. This was undoubtedly due, in large measure, to the\\r\\nactivities of Professor Masaryk, the president of the National Executive\\r\\nCouncil of the Czecho-Slovaks. His four-year exile in the United States\\r\\nhad the establishment of the new nation as its fruit.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Masaryk called attention to the fact that there is a peculiar\\r\\ndiscrepancy between the number of states in Europe and the number of\\r\\nnationalities--twenty-seven states to seventy nationalities. He\\r\\nexplained, also, that almost all the states are mixed, from the point of\\r\\nnationality. From the west of Europe to the east, this is found to be\\r\\ntrue, and the farther east one goes the more mixed do the states become.\\r\\nAustria is the most mixed of all the states. There is no Austrian\\r\\nlanguage, but there are nine languages, and six smaller nations or\\r\\nremnants of nations. In all of Germany there are eight nationalities\\r\\nbesides the Germans, who have been independent, and who have their own\\r\\nliterature. Turkey is an anomaly, a combination of various nations\\r\\noverthrown and kept down.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the eighteenth century there has been a continuing strong movement\\r\\nfrom each nation to have its own state. Because of the mixed peoples,\\r\\nthere is much confusion. There are Roumanians in Austria, but there is a\\r\\nkingdom of Roumania. There are Southern Slavs, but there are also Serbia\\r\\nand Montenegro. It is natural that the Southern Slavs should want to be\\r\\nunited as one state. So it is with Italy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no justice in Poland being separated in three parts to serve\\r\\nthe dynasties of Prussia, Russia and Austria. The Czecho-Slovaks of\\r\\nAustria and Hungary claimed a union. The national union consists in an\\r\\nendeavor to make the suppressed nations free, to unite them in their own\\r\\nstates, and to readjust the states that exist; to force Austria and\\r\\nPrussia to give up the states that should be free.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the future, said Doctor Masaryk, there are to be sharp ethnological\\r\\nboundaries. The Czecho-Slovaks will guarantee the minorities absolute\\r\\nequality, but they will keep the German part of their country, because\\r\\nthere are many Bohemians in it and they do not trust the Germans.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PLOTTER BEHIND THE SCENES\\r\\n\\r\\nOne factor alone caused the great war. It was not the assassination at\\r\\nSarajevo, not the Slavic ferment of anti-Teutonism in Austria and the\\r\\nBalkans. The only cause of the world\\'s greatest war was the\\r\\ndetermination of the German High Command and the powerful circle\\r\\nsurrounding it that \"Der Tag\" had arrived. The assassination at Sarajevo\\r\\nwas only the peg for the pendant of war. Another peg would have been\\r\\nfound inevitably had not the projection of that assassination presented\\r\\nitself as the excuse.\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany\\'s military machine was ready. A gray-green uniform that at a\\r\\ndistance would fade into misty obscurity had been devised after\\r\\nexhaustive experiments by optical, dye and cloth experts co-operating\\r\\nwith the military high command. These uniforms had been standardized and\\r\\nfitted for the millions of men enrolled in Germany\\'s regular and reserve\\r\\narmies. Rifles, great pyramids of munitions, field kitchens, traveling\\r\\npost-offices, motor lorries, a network of military railways leading to\\r\\nthe French and Belgian border, all these and more had been made ready.\\r\\nGerman soldiers had received instructions which enabled each man at a\\r\\nsignal to go to an appointed place where he found everything in\\r\\nreadiness for his long forced marches into the territory of Germany\\'s\\r\\nneighbors.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than all this, Germany\\'s spy system, the most elaborate and\\r\\nunscrupulous in the history of mankind, had enabled the German High\\r\\nCommand to construct in advance of the declaration of war concrete gun\\r\\nemplacements in Belgium and other invaded territory. The cellars of\\r\\ndwellings and shops rented or owned by German spies were camouflaged\\r\\nconcrete foundations for the great guns of Austria and Germany. These\\r\\nemplacements were in exactly the right position for use against the\\r\\nfortresses of Germany\\'s foes. Advertisements and shop-signs were used by\\r\\nspies as guides for the marching German armies of invasion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Painting of KAISER WILLIAM II.]\\r\\n  Copyright Press Illustrating Service.\\r\\n  KAISER WILLIAM II OF GERMANY\\r\\n  Posterity will regard him as more responsible than any other human\\r\\n  being for the sacrifice of millions of lives in the great war, as a\\r\\n  ruler who might have been beneficent and wise, but attempted to\\r\\n  destroy the liberties of mankind and to raise on their ruins an odious\\r\\n  despotism. To forgive him and to forget his terrible transgressions\\r\\n  would be to condone them.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Men marching past a band.]\\r\\n  Copyright Underwood and Underwood, N, Y.\\r\\n  FRANCIS JOSEPH I OF AUSTRIA, THE \"OLD EMPEROR,\" ON A STATE OCCASION.\\r\\n  Francis Joseph died before the war had settled the fate of the\\r\\n  Hapsburgs. The end came on November 21, 1916, in the sixty-eighth year\\r\\n  of his reign. His life was tragic. He lived to see his brother\\r\\n  executed, his Queen assassinated, and his only son a suicide, with\\r\\n  always before him the specter of the disintegration of his many-raced\\r\\n  empire.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn brief, Germany had planned for war. She was approximately ready for\\r\\nit. Under the shelter of such high-sounding phrases as \"We demand our\\r\\nplace in the sun,\" and \"The seas must be free,\" the German people were\\r\\neducated into the belief that the hour of Germany\\'s destiny was at hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map of Africa.]\\r\\n  GERMANY\\'S POSSESSIONS IN AFRICA PRIOR TO 1914\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGerman psychologists, like other German scientists, had co-operated with\\r\\nthe imperial militaristic government for many years to bring the\\r\\nGermanic mind into a condition of docility. So well did they understand\\r\\nthe mentality and the trends of character of the German people that it\\r\\nwas comparatively easy to impose upon them a militaristic system and\\r\\nphilosophy by which the individual yielded countless personal liberties\\r\\nfor the alleged good of the state. Rigorous and compulsory military\\r\\nservice, unquestioning adherence to the doctrine that might makes right\\r\\nand a cession to \"the All-Highest,\" as the Emperor was styled, of\\r\\nsupreme powers in the state, are some of the sufferances to which the\\r\\nGerman people submitted.\\r\\n\\r\\nGerman propaganda abroad was quite as vigorous as at home, but\\r\\ninfinitely less successful. The German High Command did not expect\\r\\nEngland to enter the war. It counted upon America\\'s neutrality with a\\r\\nleaning toward Germany. It believed that German colonization in South\\r\\nAfrica and South America would incline these vast domains toward\\r\\nfriendship for the Central empires. How mistaken the propagandists and\\r\\npsychologists were events have demonstrated.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was this dream of world-domination by Teutonic kultur that supplied\\r\\nthe motive leading to the world\\'s greatest war. Bosnia, an unwilling\\r\\nprovince of Austria-Hungary, at one time a province of Serbia and\\r\\noverwhelmingly Slavic in its population, had been seething for years\\r\\nwith an anti-Teutonic ferment. The Teutonic court at Vienna, leading the\\r\\nminority Germanic party in Austria-Hungary, had been endeavoring to\\r\\nallay the agitation among the Bosnian Slavs. In pursuance of that\\r\\npolicy, Archduke Francis Ferdinand, heir-presumptive to the thrones of\\r\\nAustria and Hungary, and his morganatic wife, Sophia Chotek, Duchess of\\r\\nHohenberg, on June 28, 1914, visited Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia. On\\r\\nthe morning of that day, while they were being driven through the narrow\\r\\nstreets of the ancient town, a bomb was thrown at them, but they were\\r\\nuninjured. They were driven through the streets again in the afternoon,\\r\\nfor purpose of public display. A student, just out of his \\'teens, one\\r\\nGavrilo Prinzep, attacked the royal party with a magazine pistol and\\r\\nkilled both the Archduke and his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere was the excuse for which Germany had waited. Here was the dawn of\\r\\n\"The Day.\" The Germanic court of Austria asserted that the crime was the\\r\\nresult of a conspiracy, leading directly to the Slavic court of Serbia.\\r\\nThe Serbians in their turn declared that they knew nothing of the\\r\\nassassination. They pointed out the fact that Sophia Chotek was a Slav,\\r\\nand that Francis Ferdinand was more liberal than any other member of the\\r\\nAustrian royal household, and finally, that he, more than any other\\r\\nmember of the Austrian court, understood and respected the Slavic\\r\\ncharacter and aspirations.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt six o\\'clock on the evening of July 23d, Austria sent an ultimatum to\\r\\nSerbia, presenting eleven demands and stipulating that categorical\\r\\nreplies must be delivered before six o\\'clock on the evening of July\\r\\n25th. Although the language in which the ultimatum was couched was\\r\\nhumiliating to Serbia, the answer was duly delivered within the\\r\\nstipulated time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe demands of the Austrian note in brief were as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. The Serbian Government to give formal assurance of its condemnation\\r\\nof Serb propaganda against Austria.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. The next issue of the Serbian \"Official Journal\" was to contain a\\r\\ndeclaration to that effect.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. This declaration to express regret that Serbian officers had taken\\r\\npart in the propaganda.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. The Serbian Government to promise that it would proceed rigorously\\r\\nagainst all guilty of such activity.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. This declaration to be at once communicated by the King of Serbia to\\r\\nhis army, and to be published in the official bulletin as an order of\\r\\nthe day.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. All anti-Austrian publications in Serbia to be suppressed.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. The Serbian political party known as the \"National Union\" to be\\r\\nsuppressed, and its means of propaganda to be confiscated.\\r\\n\\r\\n8. All anti-Austrian teaching in the schools of Serbia to be suppressed.\\r\\n\\r\\n9. All officers, civil and military, who might be designated by Austria\\r\\nas guilty of anti-Austrian propaganda to be dismissed by the Serbian\\r\\nGovernment.\\r\\n\\r\\n10. Austrian agents to co-operate with the Serbian Government in\\r\\nsuppressing all anti-Austrian propaganda, and to take part in the\\r\\njudicial proceedings conducted in Serbia against those charged with\\r\\ncomplicity in the crime at Sarajevo.\\r\\n\\r\\n11. Serbia to explain to Austria the meaning of anti-Austrian utterances\\r\\nof Serbian officials at home and abroad, since the assassination.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the first and second demands Serbia unhesitatingly assented. To the\\r\\nthird demand, Serbia assented, although no evidence was given to show\\r\\nthat Serbian officers had taken part in the propaganda.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Serbian Government assented to the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and\\r\\neighth demands also.\\r\\n\\r\\nExtraordinary as was the ninth demand, which would allow the Austrian\\r\\nGovernment to proscribe Serbian officials, so eager for peace and\\r\\nfriendship was the Serbian Government that it assented to it, with the\\r\\nstipulation that the Austrian Government should offer some proof of the\\r\\nguilt of the proscribed officers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tenth demand, which in effect allowed Austrian agents to control the\\r\\npolice and courts of Serbia, it was not possible for Serbia to accept\\r\\nwithout abrogating her sovereignty. However, it was not unconditionally\\r\\nrejected, but the Serbian Government asked that it be made the subject\\r\\nof further discussion, or be referred to arbitration. The Serbian\\r\\nGovernment assented to the eleventh demand, on the condition that if the\\r\\nexplanations which would be given concerning the alleged anti-Austrian\\r\\nutterances of Serbian officials would not prove satisfactory to the\\r\\nAustrian Government, the matter should be submitted to mediation or\\r\\narbitration.\\r\\n\\r\\nBehind the threat conveyed in the Austrian ultimatum was the menacing\\r\\nfigure of militant Germany. The veil that had hitherto concealed the\\r\\nhands that worked the string, was removed when Germany, under the\\r\\npretense of localizing the quarrel to Serbian and Austrian soil,\\r\\ninterrogated France and England, asking them to prevent Russia from\\r\\ndefending Serbia in the event of an attack by Austria upon the Serbs.\\r\\nEngland and France promptly refused to participate in a tragedy which\\r\\nwould deliver Serbia to Austria as Bosnia had been delivered. Russia,\\r\\nbound by race and creed to Serbia, read into the ultimatum of Teutonic\\r\\nkultur a determination for warfare. Mobilization of the Russian forces\\r\\nalong the Austrian frontier was arranged, when it was seen that Serbia\\'s\\r\\npacific reply to Austria\\'s demands would be contemptuously disregarded\\r\\nby Germany and Austria.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the days that intervened between the issuance of the ultimatum\\r\\nand the actual declaration of war by Germany against Russia on Saturday,\\r\\nAugust 1st, various sincere efforts were made to stave off the\\r\\nworld-shaking catastrophe. Arranged chronologically, these events may\\r\\nthus be summarized: Russia, on July 24th, formally asked Austria if she\\r\\nintended to annex Serbian territory by way of reprisal for the\\r\\nassassination at Sarajevo. On the same day Austria replied that it had\\r\\nno present intention to make such annexation. Russia then requested an\\r\\nextension of the forty-eight-hour time-limit named in the ultimatum.\\r\\n\\r\\nAustria, on the morning of Saturday, July 25th, refused Russia\\'s request\\r\\nfor an extension of the period named in the ultimatum. On the same day,\\r\\nthe newspapers published in Petrograd printed an official note issued by\\r\\nthe Russian Government warning Europe generally that Russia would not\\r\\nremain indifferent to the fate of Serbia. These newspapers also printed\\r\\nthe appeal of the Serbian Crown Prince to the Czar dated on the\\r\\npreceding day, urging that Russia come to the rescue of the menaced\\r\\nSerbs. Serbia\\'s peaceful reply surrendering on all points except one,\\r\\nand agreeing to submit that to arbitration, was sent late in the\\r\\nafternoon of the same day, and that night Austria declared the reply to\\r\\nbe unsatisfactory and withdrew its minister from Belgrade.\\r\\n\\r\\nEngland commenced its attempts at pacification on the following day,\\r\\nSunday, July 26th. Sir Edward Grey spent the entire Sabbath in the\\r\\nForeign Office and personally conducted the correspondence that was\\r\\ncalculated to bring the dispute to a peaceful conclusion. He did not\\r\\nreckon, however, with a Germany determined upon war, a Germany whose\\r\\nmanufacturers, ship-owners and Junkers had combined with its militarists\\r\\nto achieve \"Germany\\'s place in the sun\" even though the world would be\\r\\nstained in the blood of the most frightful war this earth has ever\\r\\nknown. Realization of this fact did not come to Sir Edward Grey until\\r\\nhis negotiations with Germany and with Austria-Hungary had proceeded for\\r\\nsome time. His first suggestion was that the dispute between Russia and\\r\\nAustria be committed to the arbitration of Great Britain, France, Italy\\r\\nand Germany. Russia accepted this but Germany and Austria rejected it.\\r\\nRussia had previously suggested that the dispute be settled by a\\r\\nconference between the diplomatic heads at Vienna and Petrograd. This\\r\\nalso was refused by Austria.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Edward Grey renewed his efforts on Monday, July 27th, with an\\r\\ninvitation to Germany to present suggestions of its own, looking toward\\r\\na settlement. This note was never answered. Germany took the position\\r\\nthat its proposition to compel Russia to stand aside while Austria\\r\\npunished Serbia had been rejected by England and France and it had\\r\\nnothing further to propose.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring all this period of negotiation the German Foreign Office, to all\\r\\noutward appearances at least, had been acting independently of the\\r\\nKaiser, who was in Norway on a vacation trip. He returned to Potsdam on\\r\\nthe night of Sunday, July 26th. On Monday morning the Czar of Russia\\r\\nreceived a personal message from the Kaiser, urging Russia to stand\\r\\naside that Serbia might be punished. The Czar immediately replied with\\r\\nthe suggestion that the whole matter be submitted to The Hague. No reply\\r\\nof any kind was ever made to this proposal by Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: THE GERMAN CONFEDERATION IN 1815 (Map: Baltic Sea on the\\r\\nNorth, Adriatic Sea on the South, Eastern France and Belgium on the\\r\\nWest, Poland on the East.)]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll suggestions and negotiations looking forward to peace were brought\\r\\nto a tragic end on the following day, Tuesday, July 28th, when Austria\\r\\ndeclared war on Serbia, having speedily mobilized troops at strategic\\r\\npoints on the Serbian border. Russian mobilization, which had been\\r\\nproceeding only in a tentative way, on the Austrian border, now became\\r\\ngeneral, and on July 30th, mobilization of the entire Russian army was\\r\\nproclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany\\'s effort to exclude England from the war began on Thursday, July\\r\\n29th. A note, sounding Sir Edward Grey on the question of British\\r\\nneutrality in the event of war was received, and a curt refusal to\\r\\ncommit the British Empire to such a proposal was the reply. Sir Edward\\r\\nGrey, in a last determined effort to avoid a world-war, suggested to\\r\\nGermany, Austria, Serbia and Russia that the military operations\\r\\ncommenced by Austria should be recognized as merely a punitive\\r\\nexpedition. He further suggested that when a point in Serbian territory\\r\\npreviously fixed upon should have been reached, Austria would halt and\\r\\nwould submit her further action to arbitration in the conference of the\\r\\nPowers. Russia and Serbia agreed unreservedly to this proposition.\\r\\nAustria gave a half-hearted assent to the principle involved. Germany\\r\\nmade no reply.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe die was cast for war on the following day, July 31st, when Germany\\r\\nmade a dictatorial and arrogant demand upon Russia that mobilization of\\r\\nthat nation\\'s military forces be stopped within twelve hours. Russia\\r\\nmade no reply, and on Saturday, August 1st, Germany set the world aflame\\r\\nwith the dread of war\\'s horror by her declaration of war upon Russia.\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany\\'s responsibility for this monumental crime against the peace of\\r\\nthe world is eternally fixed upon her, not only by these outward and\\r\\nvisible acts and negotiations, not only by her years of patient\\r\\npreparation for the war into which she plunged the world. The\\r\\nresponsibility is fastened upon her forever by the revelations of her\\r\\nown ambassador to England during this fateful period. Prince Lichnowsky,\\r\\nin a remarkable communication which was given to the world, laid bare\\r\\nthe machinations of the German High Command and its advisers. He was a\\r\\nguest of the Kaiser at Kiel on board the Imperial yacht Meteor when the\\r\\nmessage was received informing the Kaiser of the assassination at\\r\\nSarajevo. His story continues:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing unacquainted with the Vienna viewpoint and what was going on\\r\\nthere, I attached no very far-reaching significance to the event; but,\\r\\nlooking back, I could feel sure that in the Austrian aristocracy a\\r\\nfeeling of relief outweighed all others. His Majesty regretted that his\\r\\nefforts to win over the Archduke to his ideas had thus been frustrated\\r\\nby the Archduke\\'s assassination.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went on to Berlin and saw the Chancellor, von Bethmann-Hollweg. I told\\r\\nhim that I regarded our foreign situation as very satisfactory as it was\\r\\na long time indeed since we had stood so well with England. And in\\r\\nFrance there was a pacifist cabinet. Herr von Bethmann-Hollweg did not\\r\\nseem to share my optimism.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe complained of the Russian armaments. I tried to tranquilize him with\\r\\nthe argument that it was not to Russia\\'s interest to attack us, and that\\r\\nsuch an attack would never have English or French support, as both\\r\\ncountries wanted peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went from him to Dr. Zimmermann (the under Secretary) who was acting\\r\\nfor Herr von Jagow (the Foreign Secretary), and learned from him that\\r\\nRussia was about to call up nine hundred thousand new troops. His words\\r\\nunmistakably denoted ill-humor against Russia, who, he said, stood\\r\\neverywhere in our way. In addition, there were questions of commercial\\r\\npolicy that had to be settled. That General von Moltke was urging war\\r\\nwas, of course, not told to me. I learned, however, that Herr von\\r\\nTschirschky (the German Ambassador in Vienna) had been reproved because\\r\\nhe said that he had advised Vienna to show moderation toward Serbia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPrince Lichnowsky went to his summer home in Silesia, quite unaware of the\\r\\nimpending crisis. He continues:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I returned from Silesia on my way to London, I stopped only a few\\r\\nhours in Berlin, where I heard that Austria intended to proceed against\\r\\nSerbia so as to bring to an end an unbearable state of affairs.\\r\\nUnfortunately, I failed at the moment to gauge the significance of the\\r\\nnews. I thought that once more it would come to nothing; that even if\\r\\nRussia acted threateningly, the matter could soon be settled. I now\\r\\nregret that I did not stay in Berlin and declare there and then that I\\r\\nwould have no hand in such a policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a meeting in Potsdam, as early as July 5th, between the German\\r\\nand Austrian authorities, at which meeting war was decided on. Prince\\r\\nLichnowsky says:\\r\\n\\r\\nI learned afterwards that at the decisive discussion at Potsdam on July\\r\\n5th the Austrian demand had met with the unconditional approval of all\\r\\nthe personages in authority; it was even added that no harm would be\\r\\ndone if war with Russia did come out of it. It was so stated at least in\\r\\nthe Austrian report received at London by Count Mensdorff (the Austrian\\r\\nAmbassador to England).\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this point I received instructions to endeavor to bring the English\\r\\npress to a friendly attitude in case Austria should deal the death-blow\\r\\nto \"Greater-Serbian\" hopes. I was to use all my influence to prevent\\r\\npublic opinion in England from taking a stand against Austria. I\\r\\nremembered England\\'s attitude during the Bosnian annexation crisis, when\\r\\npublic opinion showed itself in sympathy with the Serbian claims to\\r\\nBosnia; I recalled also the benevolent promotion of nationalist hopes\\r\\nthat went on in the days of Lord Byron and Garibaldi; and on these and\\r\\nother grounds I thought it extremely unlikely that English public\\r\\nopinion would support a punitive expedition against the Archduke\\'s\\r\\nmurderers. I thus felt it my duty to enter an urgent warning against the\\r\\nwhole project, which I characterized as venturesome and dangerous, I\\r\\nrecommended that counsels of moderation he given Austria, as I did not\\r\\nbelieve that the conflict could be localized (that is to say, it could\\r\\nnot be limited to a war between Austria and Serbia).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photographs of Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg and Prince\\r\\nMaximilian.]\\r\\n  Photos from International Film Service.\\r\\n  THE GERMAN CHANCELLORS\\r\\n  On the right is Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg who is held responsible\\r\\n  in large measure for bringing on the war.

THE DEPOSED RULERS OF\\r\\n  AUSTRIA-HUNGARY The ex-Emperor Charles and his wife, the ex-Empress\\r\\n  Zita, in deep conversation with Hungarian leaders who are explaining\\r\\n  the distressing situation confronting the country.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHerr von Jagow answered me that Russia was not prepared; that there\\r\\nwould be more or less of a rumpus; but that the more firmly we stood by\\r\\nAustria, the more surely would Russia give way. Austria was already\\r\\nblaming us for flabbiness and we could not flinch. On the other hand,\\r\\nRussian sentiment was growing more unfriendly all the time, and we must\\r\\nsimply take the risk. I subsequently learned that this attitude was\\r\\nbased on advices from Count Pourtales (the German Ambassador in\\r\\nPetrograd), that Russia would not stir under any circumstances;\\r\\ninformation which prompted us to spur Count Berchtold on in his course.\\r\\nOn learning the attitude of the German Government I looked for salvation\\r\\nthrough English mediation, knowing that Sir Edward Grey\\'s influence in\\r\\nPetrograd could be used in the cause of peace. I, therefore, availed\\r\\nmyself of my friendly relations with the Minister to ask him\\r\\nconfidentially to advise moderation in Russia in case Austria demanded\\r\\nsatisfaction from the Serbians, as it seemed likely she would.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe English press was quiet at first, and friendly to Austria, the\\r\\nassassination being generally condemned. By degrees, however, more and\\r\\nmore voices made themselves heard, in the sense that, however necessary\\r\\nit might be to take cognizance of the crime, any exploitation of it for\\r\\npolitical ends was unjustifiable. Moderation was enjoined upon Austria.\\r\\nWhen the ultimatum came out, all the papers, with the exception of the\\r\\nStandard, were unanimous in condemning it. The whole world, outside of\\r\\nBerlin and Vienna, realized that it meant war, and a world war too. The\\r\\nEnglish fleet, which happened to have been holding a naval review, was\\r\\nnot demobilized.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British Government labored to make the Serbian reply conciliatory,\\r\\nand \"the Serbian answer was in keeping with the British efforts.\" Sir\\r\\nEdward Grey then proposed his plan of mediation upon the two points\\r\\nwhich Serbia had not wholly conceded. Prince Lichnowsky writes:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nM. Cambon (for France), Marquis Imperiali (for Italy), and I were to\\r\\nmeet, with Sir Edward in the chair, and it would have been easy to work\\r\\nout a formula for the debated points, which had to do with the\\r\\nco-operation of imperial and royal officials in the inquiries to be\\r\\nconducted at Belgrade. By the exercise of good will everything could\\r\\nhave been settled in one or two sittings, and the mere acceptance of the\\r\\nBritish proposal would have relieved the strain and further improved our\\r\\nrelations with England. I seconded this plan with all my energies. In\\r\\nvain. I was told (by Berlin) that it would be against the dignity of\\r\\nAustria. Of course, all that was needed was one hint from Berlin to\\r\\nCount Berchtold (the Austrian Foreign Minister); he would have satisfied\\r\\nhimself with a diplomatic triumph and rested on the Serbian answer. That\\r\\nhint was never given. On the contrary, pressure was brought in favor of\\r\\nwar....\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter our refusal Sir Edward asked us to come forward with our proposal.\\r\\nWe insisted on war. No other answer could I get (from Berlin) than that\\r\\nit was a colossal condescension on the part of Austria not to\\r\\ncontemplate any acquisition of territory. Sir Edward justly pointed out\\r\\nthat one could reduce a country to vassalage without acquiring\\r\\nterritory; that Russia would see this, and regard it as a humiliation\\r\\nnot to be put up with. The impression grew stronger and stronger that we\\r\\nwere bent on war. Otherwise our attitude toward a question in which we\\r\\nwere not directly concerned was incomprehensible. The insistent requests\\r\\nand well-defined declarations of M. Sasanof, the Czar\\'s positively\\r\\nhumble telegrams, Sir Edward\\'s repeated proposals, the warnings of\\r\\nMarquis San Guiliano and of Bollati, my own pressing admonitions were\\r\\nall of no avail. Berlin remained inflexible--Serbia must be slaughtered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, on the 29th, Sir Edward decided upon his well-known warning. I\\r\\ntold him I had always reported (to Berlin) that we should have to reckon\\r\\nwith English opposition if it came to a war with France. Time and again\\r\\nthe Minister said to me, \"If war breaks out it will be the greatest\\r\\ncatastrophe the world has ever seen.\" And now events moved rapidly.\\r\\nCount Berchtold at last decided to come around, having up to that point\\r\\nplayed the role of \"Strong man\" under guidance of Berlin. Thereupon we\\r\\n(in answer to Russia\\'s mobilization) sent our ultimatum and declaration\\r\\nof war--after Russia had spent a whole week in fruitless negotiation and\\r\\nwaiting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus ended my mission in London. It had suffered shipwreck, not on the\\r\\nwiles of the Briton but on the wiles of our own policy. Were not those\\r\\nright who saw that the German people was pervaded with the spirit of\\r\\nTreitschke and Bernhardi, which glorifies war as an end instead of\\r\\nholding it in abhorrence as an evil thing? Properly speaking militarism\\r\\nis a school for the people and an instrument to further political ends.\\r\\nBut in the patriarchal absolutism of a military monarchy, militarism\\r\\nexploits politics to further its own ends, and can create a situation\\r\\nwhich a democracy freed from junkerdom would not tolerate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is what our enemies think; that is what they are bound to think\\r\\nwhen they see that in spite of capitalistic industrialism, and in spite\\r\\nof socialistic organizations, the living, as Nietzsche said, are still\\r\\nruled by the dead. The democratization of Germany, the first war aim\\r\\nproposed by our enemies, will become a reality.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the frank statement of a great German statesman made long before\\r\\nGermany received its knock-out blow. It was written when Germany was\\r\\nsweeping all before it on land, and when the U-boat was at the height of\\r\\nits murderous powers on the high seas. No one in nor out of Germany has\\r\\ncontroverted any of its statements and it will forever remain as one of\\r\\nthe counts in the indictment against Germany and the sole cause of the\\r\\nworld\\'s greatest misery, the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerica\\'s outstanding authority on matters of international conduct,\\r\\nformer Secretary of State Elihu Root declared that the World War was a\\r\\nmighty and all-embracing struggle between two conflicting principles of\\r\\nhuman right and human duty; it was a conflict between the divine right\\r\\nof kings to govern mankind through armies and nobles, and the right of\\r\\nthe peoples of the earth who toil and endure and aspire to govern\\r\\nthemselves by law under justice, and in the freedom of individual\\r\\nmanhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the declaration of war against Russia by Germany, events marched\\r\\nrapidly and inevitably toward the general conflagration. Germany\\'s most\\r\\nstrenuous efforts were directed toward keeping England out of the\\r\\nconflict. We have seen in the revelations of Prince Lichnowsky how eager\\r\\nwas England to divert Germany\\'s murderous purpose. There are some\\r\\ndetails, however, required to fill in the diplomatic picture.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Poincare, of the French Republic, on July 30th, asked the\\r\\nBritish Ambassador in Paris for an assurance of British support. On the\\r\\nfollowing day he addressed a similar letter to King George of England.\\r\\nBoth requests were qualifiedly refused on the ground that England wished\\r\\nto be free to continue negotiations with Germany for the purpose of\\r\\naverting the war. In the meantime, the German Government addressed a\\r\\nnote to England offering guarantees for Belgian integrity, providing\\r\\nBelgium did not side with France, offering to respect the neutrality of\\r\\nHolland and giving assurance that no French territory in Europe would be\\r\\nannexed if Germany won the war. Sir Edward Grey described this as a\\r\\n\"shameful proposal,\" and rejected it on July 30th.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 31st England sent a note to France and Germany asking for a\\r\\nstatement of purpose concerning Belgian neutrality. France immediately\\r\\nannounced that it would respect the treaty of 1839 and its reaffirmation\\r\\nin 1870 guaranteeing Belgium\\'s neutrality. This treaty was entered into\\r\\nby Germany, England, France, Austria and Russia. Germany\\'s reply on\\r\\nAugust 1st was a proposal that she would respect the neutrality of\\r\\nBelgium if England would stay out of the war. This was promptly\\r\\ndeclined. On August 2d the British cabinet agreed that if the German\\r\\nfleet attempted to attack the coast of France the British fleet would\\r\\nintervene. Germany, the next day, sent a note agreeing to refrain from\\r\\nnaval attacks on France provided England would remain neutral, but\\r\\ndeclined to commit herself as to the neutrality of Belgium. Before this,\\r\\nhowever, on August 2d, Germany had announced to Belgium its intention to\\r\\nenter Belgium for the purpose of attacking France. The Belgian Minister\\r\\nin London made an appeal to the British Foreign Office and was informed\\r\\nthat invasion of Belgium by Germany would be followed by England\\'s\\r\\ndeclaration of war. Monday, August 3d, was signalized by Belgium\\'s\\r\\ndeclaration of its neutrality and its firm purpose to defend its soil\\r\\nagainst invasion by France, England, Germany or any other nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe actual invasion of Belgium commenced on the morning of August 4th,\\r\\nwhen twelve regiments of Uhlans crossed the frontier near Vise, and came\\r\\nin contact with a Belgian force driving it back upon Liege. King Albert\\r\\nof Belgium promptly appealed to England, Russia and France for aid in\\r\\nrepelling the invader. England sent an ultimatum to Germany fixing\\r\\nmidnight of August 4th as the time for expiration of the ultimatum. This\\r\\ndemanded that satisfactory assurances be furnished immediately that\\r\\nGermany would respect the neutrality of Belgium. No reply was made by\\r\\nGermany and England\\'s declaration of war followed.\\r\\n\\r\\nChancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg, of the German Empire, wrote Germany\\'s\\r\\ninfamy into history when, in a formal statement, he acknowledged that\\r\\nthe invasion of Belgium was \"a wrong that we will try to make good again\\r\\nas soon as our military ends have been reached.\" To Sir Edward Vochen,\\r\\nBritish Ambassador to Germany, he addressed the inquiry: \"Is it the\\r\\npurpose of your country to make war upon Germany for the sake of a scrap\\r\\nof paper?\" The treaty of 1839-1870 guaranteeing Belgium\\'s neutrality was\\r\\nthe scrap of paper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photographs]\\r\\n  KING ALBERT I,  QUEEN ELIZABETH, THE HEROIC RULERS OF BELGIUM\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph showing bombed out shells of buildings.

The records of the German Foreign Office prove that fact. The\\r\\nreason for this lay in the long line of powerful fortresses along the\\r\\nline that divides France from Germany and the sparsely spaced and\\r\\ncomparatively out-of-date forts on the border between Germany and\\r\\nBelgium. True, there was a treaty guaranteeing the inviolability of\\r\\nBelgian territory to which Germany was a signatory party. Some of the\\r\\nclauses of that treaty were:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle 9. Belgium, within the limits traced in conformity with the\\r\\nprinciples laid down in the present preliminaries, shall form a\\r\\nperpetually neutral state. The five powers (England, France, Austria,\\r\\nPrussia and Russia), without wishing to intervene in the internal\\r\\naffairs of Belgium, guarantee her that perpetual neutrality as well as\\r\\nthe integrity and inviolability of her territory in the limits mentioned\\r\\nin the present article.\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle 10. By just reciprocity Belgium shall be held to observe this\\r\\nsame neutrality toward all the other states and to make no attack on\\r\\ntheir internal or external tranquillity while always preserving the\\r\\nright to defend herself against any foreign aggression.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis agreement was followed on January 23, 1839, by a definitive treaty,\\r\\naccepted by Belgium and by the Netherlands, which treaty regulates\\r\\nBelgium\\'s neutrality as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle 7. Belgium, within the limits defined in Articles 1, 2 and 4\\r\\nshall form an independent and perpetually neutral state. She is\\r\\nobligated to preserve this neutrality against all the other states.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo convert this solemn covenant into a \"scrap of paper\" it was necessary\\r\\nthat Germany should find an excuse for tearing it to pieces. There was\\r\\nabsolutely no provocation in sight, but that did not deter the German\\r\\nHigh Command. That august body with no information whatever to afford an\\r\\nexcuse, alleged in a formal note to the Belgian Government that the\\r\\nFrench army intended to invade Germany through Belgian territory. This\\r\\nhypocritical and mendacious note and Belgium\\'s vigorous reply follow:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNote handed in on August 2, 1914, at 7 o\\'clock P. M., by Herr von\\r\\nBelow-Saleske, German Minister, to M. Davignon, Belgian Minister for\\r\\nForeign Affairs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBRUSSELS, 2d August, 1914.\\r\\nIMPERIAL GERMAN LEGATION IN BELGIUM\\r\\n(Highly confidential)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German Government has received reliable information according to\\r\\nwhich the French forces intend to march on the Meuse, by way of Givet\\r\\nand Namur. This information leaves no doubt as to the intention of\\r\\nFrance of marching on Germany through Belgian territory. The Imperial\\r\\nGovernment cannot avoid the fear that Belgium, in spite of its best\\r\\nwill, will be in no position to repulse such a largely developed French\\r\\nmarch without aid. In this fact there is sufficient certainty of a\\r\\nthreat directed against Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is an imperative duty for the preservation of Germany to forestall\\r\\nthis attack of the enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German Government would feel keen regret if Belgium should regard as\\r\\nan act of hostility against herself the fact that the measures of the\\r\\nenemies of Germany oblige her on her part to violate Belgian territory.\\r\\nIn order to dissipate any misunderstanding the German Government\\r\\ndeclares as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Germany does not contemplate any act of hostility against Belgium. If\\r\\nBelgium consents in the war about to commence to take up an attitude of\\r\\nfriendly neutrality toward Germany, the German Government on its part\\r\\nundertakes, on the declaration of peace, to guarantee the kingdom and\\r\\nits possessions in their whole extent.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Germany undertakes under the conditions laid down to evacuate Belgian\\r\\nterritory as soon as peace is concluded.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. If Belgium preserves a friendly attitude, Germany is prepared, in\\r\\nagreement with the authorities of the Belgian Government, to buy against\\r\\ncash all that is required by her troops, and to give indemnity for the\\r\\ndamages caused in Belgium.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. If Belgium behaves in a hostile manner toward the German troops, and\\r\\nin particular raises difficulties against their advance by the\\r\\nopposition of the fortifications of the Meuse, or by destroying roads,\\r\\nrailways, tunnels, or other engineering works, Germany will be compelled\\r\\nto consider Belgium as an enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this case Germany will take no engagements toward Belgium, but she\\r\\nwill leave the later settlement of relations of the two states toward\\r\\none another to the decision of arms. The German Government has a\\r\\njustified hope that this contingency will not arise and that the Belgian\\r\\nGovernment will know how to take suitable measures to hinder its taking\\r\\nplace. In this case the friendly relations which unite the two\\r\\nneighboring states will become closer and more lasting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE REPLY BY BELGIUM\\r\\nNote handed in by M. Davignon, Minister for Foreign Affairs, to Herr von\\r\\nBelow-Saleske, German Minister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBRUSSELS, 3d August, 1914.\\r\\n(7 o\\'clock in the morning.)\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the note of the 2d August, 1914, the German Government has made known\\r\\nthat according to certain intelligence the French forces intend to march\\r\\non the Meuse via Givet and Namur and that Belgium, in spite of her\\r\\ngood-will, would not be able without help to beat off an advance of the\\r\\nFrench troops.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German Government felt it to be its duty to forestall this attack\\r\\nand to violate Belgian territory. Under these conditions Germany\\r\\nproposes to the King\\'s Government to take up a friendly attitude, and\\r\\nundertakes at the moment of peace to guarantee the integrity of the\\r\\nkingdom and of her possessions in their whole extent. The note adds that\\r\\nif Belgium raises difficulties to the forward march of the German troops\\r\\nGermany will be compelled to consider her as an enemy and to leave the\\r\\nlater settlement of the two states toward one another to the decision of\\r\\narms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis note caused profound and painful surprise to the King\\'s Government.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe intentions which it attributed to France are in contradiction with\\r\\nthe express declarations which were made to us on the 1st of August, in\\r\\nthe name of the government of the republic.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, if, contrary to our expectation, a violation of Belgian\\r\\nneutrality were to be committed by France, Belgium would fulfil all her\\r\\ninternational duties and her army would offer the most vigorous\\r\\nopposition to the invader.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe treaties of 1839, confirmed by the treaties of 1870, establish the\\r\\nindependence and the neutrality of Belgium under the guarantee of the\\r\\npowers, and particularly of the Government of his Majesty the King of\\r\\nPrussia.\\r\\n\\r\\nBelgium has always been faithful to her international obligations; she\\r\\nhas fulfilled her duties in a spirit of loyal impartiality; she has\\r\\nneglected no effort to maintain her neutrality or to make it respected.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attempt against her independence with which the German Government\\r\\nthreatens her would constitute a flagrant violation of international\\r\\nlaw. No strategic interest justifies the violation of that law.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Belgian Government would, by accepting the propositions which are\\r\\nnotified to her, sacrifice the honor of the nation while at the same\\r\\ntime betraying her duties toward Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nConscious of the part Belgium has played for more than eighty years in\\r\\nthe civilization of the world, she refuses to believe that the\\r\\nindependence of Belgium can be preserved only at the expense of the\\r\\nviolation of her neutrality.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf this hope were disappointed the Belgian Government has firmly\\r\\nresolved to repulse by every means in her power any attack upon her\\r\\nrights.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German attack upon Belgium and France came with terrible force and\\r\\nsuddenness. Twenty-four army corps, divided into three armies clad in a\\r\\nspecially designed and colored gray-green uniform, swept in three mighty\\r\\nstreams over the German borders with their objective the heart of\\r\\nFrance. The Army of the Meuse was given the route through Liege, Namur\\r\\nand Maubeuge. The Army of the Moselle violated the Duchy of Luxemburg,\\r\\nwhich, under a treaty guaranteeing its independence and neutrality, was\\r\\nnot permitted to maintain an army. Germany was a signatory party to this\\r\\ntreaty also. The Army of the Rhine cut through the Vosges Mountains and\\r\\nits route lay between the French cities of Nancy and Toul.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe heroic defense of the Belgian army at Liege against the Army of the\\r\\nMeuse delayed the operation of Germany\\'s plans and in all probability\\r\\nsaved Paris. It was the first of many similar disappointments and checks\\r\\nthat Germany encountered during the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe defense of Liege continued for ten heroic days. Within that interval\\r\\nthe first British Expeditionary Forces were landed in France and\\r\\nBelgium, the French army was mobilized to full strength. The little\\r\\nBelgian army falling back northward on Antwerp, Louvain and Brussels,\\r\\nthreatened the German flank and approximately 200,000 German soldiers\\r\\nwere compelled to remain in the conquered section of Belgium to garrison\\r\\nit effectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiege fortifications were the design of the celebrated strategist\\r\\nBrialmont. They consisted of twelve isolated fortresses which had been\\r\\npermitted to become out of repair. No field works of any kind connected\\r\\nthem and they were without provision for defense against encircling\\r\\ntactics and against modern artillery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe huge 42-centimeter guns, the first of Germany\\'s terrible surprises,\\r\\nwere brought into action against these forts, and their concrete and\\r\\narmored steel turrets were cracked as walnuts are cracked between the\\r\\njaws of a nut-cracker. The Army of the Meuse then made its way like a\\r\\ngray-green cloud of poison gas through Belgium. A cavalry screen of\\r\\ncrack Uhlan regiments preceded it, and it made no halt worthy of note\\r\\nuntil it confronted the Belgian army on the line running from Louvain to\\r\\nNamur. The Belgians were forced back before Louvain on August 20th, the\\r\\nBelgian Government removed the capital from Brussels to Antwerp, and the\\r\\nGerman hosts entered evacuated Brussels.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this advance of the Army of the Meuse, strong French detachments\\r\\ninvaded German soil, pouring into Alsace through the Belfort Gap. Brief\\r\\nsuccesses attended the bold stroke. Mulhausen was captured and the\\r\\nMetz-Strassburg Railroad was cut in several places. The French suffered\\r\\na defeat almost immediately following this first flush of victory, both\\r\\nin Alsace and in Lorraine, where a French detachment had engaged with\\r\\nthe Army of the Moselle. The French army thereupon retreated to the\\r\\nstrong line of forts and earthworks defending the border between France\\r\\nand Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\nEngland\\'s first expeditionary force landed at Ostend, Calais and Dunkirk\\r\\non August 7th. It was dubbed England\\'s \"contemptible little army\" by the\\r\\nGerman General Staff. That name was seized upon gladly by England as a\\r\\nspur to volunteering. It brought to the surface national pride and a\\r\\nfierce determination to compel Germany to recognize and to reckon with\\r\\nthe \"contemptible little army.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe contact between the French, Belgian and British forces was speedily\\r\\nestablished and something like concerted resistance to the advance of\\r\\nthe enemy was made possible. The German army, however, followed by a\\r\\nhuge equipment of motor kitchens, munition trains, and other motor\\r\\ntransport evidencing great care in preparation for the movement, swept\\r\\nresistlessly forward until it encountered the French and British on a\\r\\nline running from Mons to Charleroi.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British army was assigned to a position between two French armies.\\r\\nBy some miscalculation, the French army that was to have taken its\\r\\nposition on the British left, never appeared. The French army on the\\r\\nright was attacked and defeated at Charleroi, falling back in some\\r\\nconfusion. The German Army of the Moselle co-operating with the Army of\\r\\nthe Meuse then attacked the British and French, and a great flanking\\r\\nmovement by the German joint commands developed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was directed mainly at the British under command of Sir John\\r\\nFrench. There followed a retreat that for sheer heroism and dogged\\r\\ndetermination has become one of the great battles of all time. The\\r\\nBritish, outflanked and outnumbered three to one, fought and marched\\r\\nwithout cessation for six days and nights. Time after time envelopment\\r\\nand disaster threatened them, but with a determination that would not be\\r\\nbeaten they fought off the best that Germany could send against them,\\r\\nmaintained contact with the French army on their right, and delayed the\\r\\nGerman advance so effectively that a complete disarrangement of all the\\r\\nGerman plans ensued. This was the second great disappointment to\\r\\nGermany. It made possible the victory of the Marne and the victorious\\r\\npeace of 1918. The story of that immortal retreat is best told in the\\r\\nwords of Sir John French, transmitting the report of this encounter to\\r\\nthe British War Office:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The transport of the troops from England both by sea and by rail was\\r\\neffected in the best order and without a check. Each unit arrived at its\\r\\ndestination well within the scheduled time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The concentration was practically complete on the evening of Friday,\\r\\nthe 21st ultimo, and I was able to make dispositions to move the force\\r\\nduring Saturday, the 22d, to positions I considered most favorable from\\r\\nwhich to commence operations which the French commander-in-chief,\\r\\nGeneral Joffre, requested me to undertake in pursuance of his plans in\\r\\nprosecution of the campaign.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The line taken up extended along the line of the canal from Conde on\\r\\nthe west, through Mons and Binche on the east. This line was taken up as\\r\\nfollows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From Conde to Mons, inclusive, was assigned to the Second Corps, and to\\r\\nthe right of the Second Corps from Mons the First Corps was posted. The\\r\\nFifth Cavalry Brigade was placed at Binche.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the absence of my Third Army Corps I desired to keep the cavalry\\r\\ndivisions as much as possible as a reserve to act on my outer flank, or\\r\\nmove in support of any threatened part of the line. The forward\\r\\nreconnoissance was intrusted to Brig.-Gen. Sir Philip Chetwode, with the\\r\\nFifth Cavalry Brigade, but I directed General Allenby to send forward a\\r\\nfew squadrons to assist in this work.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"During the 22d and 23d these advanced squadrons did some excellent\\r\\nwork, some of them penetrating as far as Soignies, and several\\r\\nencounters took place in which our troops showed to great advantage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"2. At 6 A. M., on August 23d, I assembled the commanders of the First\\r\\nand Second Corps and cavalry division at a point close to the position\\r\\nand explained the general situation of the Allies, and what I understood\\r\\nto be General Joffre\\'s plan. I discussed with them at some length the\\r\\nimmediate situation in front of us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From information I received from French headquarters I understood that\\r\\nlittle more than one, or at most two, of the enemy\\'s army corps, with\\r\\nperhaps one cavalry division, were in front of my position; and I was\\r\\naware of no attempted outflanking movement by the enemy. I was confirmed\\r\\nin this opinion by the fact that my patrols encountered no undue\\r\\nopposition in their reconnoitering operations. The observations of my\\r\\nairplanes seemed to bear out this estimate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About 3 P. M. on Sunday, the 23d, reports began coming in to the effect\\r\\nthat the enemy was commencing an attack on the Mons line, apparently in\\r\\nsome strength, but that the right of the position from Mons and Bray was\\r\\nbeing particularly threatened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The commander of the First Corps had pushed his flank back to some high\\r\\nground south of Bray, and the Fifth Cavalry Brigade evacuated Binche,\\r\\nmoving slightly south; the enemy thereupon occupied Binche.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The right of the Third Division, under General Hamilton, was at Mons,\\r\\nwhich formed a somewhat dangerous salient; and I directed the commander\\r\\nof the Second Corps to be careful not to keep the troops on this salient\\r\\ntoo long, but, if threatened seriously, to draw back the center behind\\r\\nMons. This was done before dark. In the meantime, about 5 P. M., I\\r\\nreceived a most unexpected message from General Joffre by telegraph,\\r\\ntelling me that at least three German corps, viz., a reserve corps, the\\r\\nFourth Corps and the Ninth Corps, were moving on my position in front,\\r\\nand that the Second Corps was engaged in a turning movement from the\\r\\ndirection of Tournay. He also informed me that the two reserve French\\r\\ndivisions and the Fifth French army on my right were retiring, the\\r\\nGermans having on the previous day gained possession of the passages of\\r\\nthe Sambre, between Charleroi and Namur.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"3. In view of the possibility of my being driven from the Mons\\r\\nposition, I had previously ordered a position in rear to be\\r\\nreconnoitered. This position rested on the fortress of Maubeuge on the\\r\\nright and extended west to Jenlain, southeast to Valenciennes, on the\\r\\nleft. The position was reported difficult to hold, because standing\\r\\ncrops and buildings made the placing of trenches very difficult and\\r\\nlimited the field of fire in many important localities. It nevertheless\\r\\nafforded a few good artillery positions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When the news of the retirement of the French and the heavy German\\r\\nthreatening on my front reached me, I endeavored to confirm it by\\r\\nairplane reconnoissance; and as a result of this I determined to effect\\r\\na retirement to the Maubeuge position at daybreak on the 24th.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A certain amount of fighting continued along the whole line throughout\\r\\nthe night and at daybreak on the 24th the Second Division from the\\r\\nneighborhood of Harmignies made a powerful demonstration as if to retake\\r\\nBinche. This was supported by the artillery of both the First and Second\\r\\nDivisions, while the First Division took up a supporting position in the\\r\\nneighborhood of Peissant. Under cover of this demonstration the Second\\r\\nCorps retired on the line Dour-Quarouble-Frameries. The Third Division\\r\\non the right of the corps suffered considerable loss in this operation\\r\\nfrom the enemy, who had retaken Mons.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Second Corps halted on this line, where they partially intrenched\\r\\nthemselves, enabling Sir Douglas Haig with the First Corps gradually to\\r\\nwithdraw to the new position; and he effected this without much further\\r\\nloss, reaching the line Bavai-Maubeuge about 7 P. M. Toward midday the\\r\\nenemy appeared to be directing his principal effort against our left.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had previously ordered General Allenby with the cavalry to act\\r\\nvigorously in advance of my left front and endeavor to take the pressure\\r\\noff.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About 7.30 A. M. General Allenby received a message from Sir Charles\\r\\nFerguson, commanding the Fifth Division, saying that he was very hard\\r\\npressed and in urgent need of support. On receipt of this message\\r\\nGeneral Allenby drew in the cavalry and endeavored to bring direct\\r\\nsupport to the Fifth Division.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"During the course of this operation General De Lisle, of the Second\\r\\nCavalry Brigade, thought he saw a good opportunity to paralyze the\\r\\nfurther advance of the enemy\\'s infantry by making a mounted attack on\\r\\nhis flank. He formed up and advanced for this purpose, but was held up\\r\\nby wire about five hundred yards from his objective, and the Ninth\\r\\nLancers and the Eighteenth Hussars suffered severely in the retirement\\r\\nof the brigade.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Nineteenth Infantry Brigade, which had been guarding the line of\\r\\ncommunications, was brought up by rail to Valenciennes on the 22d and\\r\\n23d. On the morning of the 24th they were moved out to a position south\\r\\nof Quarouble to support the left flank of the Second Corps.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With the assistance of the cavalry Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien was enabled\\r\\nto effect his retreat to a new position; although, having two corps of\\r\\nthe enemy on his front and one threatening his flank, he suffered great\\r\\nlosses in doing so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At nightfall the position was occupied by the Second Corps to the west\\r\\nof Bavai, the First Corps to the right. The right was protected by the\\r\\nFortress of Maubeuge, the left by the Nineteenth Brigade in position\\r\\nbetween Jenlain and Bry, and the cavalry on the outer flank.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"4. The French were still retiring, and I had no support except such as\\r\\nwas afforded by the Fortress of Maubeuge; and the determined attempts of\\r\\nthe enemy to get round my left flank assured me that it was his\\r\\nintention to hem me against that place and surround me. I felt that not\\r\\na moment must be lost in retiring to another position.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had every reason to believe that the enemy\\'s forces were somewhat\\r\\nexhausted and I knew that they had suffered heavy losses. I hoped,\\r\\ntherefore, that his pursuit would not be too vigorous to prevent me\\r\\neffecting my object.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The operation, however, was full of danger and difficulty, not only\\r\\nowing to the very superior force in my front, but also to the exhaustion\\r\\nof the troops.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The retirement was recommenced in the early morning of the 25th to a\\r\\nposition in the neighborhood of Le Cateau, and rearguards were ordered\\r\\nto be clear of the Maubeuge-Bavai-Eih Road by 5.30 A. M.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Two cavalry brigades, with the divisional cavalry of the Second Corps,\\r\\ncovered the movement of the Second Corps. The remainder of the cavalry\\r\\ndivision, with the Nineteenth Brigade, the whole under the command of\\r\\nGeneral Allenby, covered the west flank.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Fourth Division commenced its detrainment at Le Cateau on Sunday,\\r\\nthe 23d, and by the morning of the 25th eleven battalions and a brigade\\r\\nof artillery with divisional staff were available for service.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I ordered General Snow to move out to take up a position with his right\\r\\nsouth of Solesmes, his left resting on the Cambrai-LeCateau Road south\\r\\nof La Chaprie. In this position the division tendered great help to the\\r\\neffective retirement of the Second and First Corps to the new position.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Although the troops had been ordered to occupy the Cambrai-Le\\r\\nCateau-Landrecies position, and the ground had, during the 25th, been\\r\\npartially prepared and intrenched, I had grave doubts, owing to the\\r\\ninformation I had received as to the accumulating strength of the enemy\\r\\nagainst me--as to the wisdom of standing there to fight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Having regard to the continued retirement of the French on my right, my\\r\\nexposed left flank, the tendency of the enemy\\'s western corps (II) to\\r\\nenvelop me, and, more than all, the exhausted condition of the troops, I\\r\\ndetermined to make a great effort to continue the retreat until I could\\r\\nput some substantial obstacle, such as the Somme or the Oise, between my\\r\\ntroops and the enemy, and afford the former some opportunity of rest and\\r\\nreorganization. Orders were, therefore, sent to the corps commanders to\\r\\ncontinue their retreat as soon as they possibly could toward the general\\r\\nline Vermand-St. Quentin-Ribemont.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The cavalry under General Allenby, were ordered to cover the\\r\\nretirement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Throughout the 25th and far into the evening, the First Corps continued\\r\\nits march on Landrecies, following the road along the eastern border of\\r\\nthe Foret de Mormal, and arrived at Landrecies about 10 o\\'clock. I had\\r\\nintended that the corps should come further west so as to fill up the\\r\\ngap between Le Cateau and Landrecies, but the men were exhausted and\\r\\ncould not get further in without rest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The enemy, however, would not allow them this rest, and about 9.30 P.\\r\\nM. a report was received that the Fourth Guards Brigade in Landrecies\\r\\nwas heavily attacked by troops of the Ninth German Army Corps, who were\\r\\ncoming through the forest on the north of the town. This brigade fought\\r\\nmost gallantly, and caused the enemy to suffer tremendous loss in\\r\\nissuing from the forest into the narrow streets of the town. This loss\\r\\nhas been estimated from reliable sources at from 700 to 1,000. At the\\r\\nsame time information reached me from Sir Douglas Haig that his First\\r\\nDivision was also heavily engaged south and east of Maroilles. I sent\\r\\nurgent messages to the commander of the two French reserve divisions on\\r\\nmy right to come up to the assistance of the First Corps, which they\\r\\neventually did. Partly owing to this assistance, but mainly to the\\r\\nskilful manner in which Sir Douglas Haig extricated his corps from an\\r\\nexceptionally difficult position in the darkness of the night, they were\\r\\nable at dawn to resume their march south toward Wassigny on Guise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By about 6 P. M. the Second Corps had got into position with their\\r\\nright on Le Cateau, their left in the neighborhood of Caudry, and the\\r\\nline of defense was continued thence by the Fourth Division toward\\r\\nSeranvillers, the left being thrown back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"During the fighting on the 24th and 25th the cavalry became a good deal\\r\\nscattered, but by the early morning of the 26th, General Allenby had\\r\\nsucceeded in concentrating two brigades to the south of Cambrai.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Fourth Division was placed under the orders of the general officer\\r\\ncommanding the Second Army Corps.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the 24th the French Cavalry Corps, consisting of three divisions\\r\\nunder General Sordet, had been in billets north of Avesnes. On my way\\r\\nback from Bavai, which was my \\'Poste de Commandement\\' during the\\r\\nfighting of the 23d and 24th, I visited General Sordet, and earnestly\\r\\nrequested his co-operation and support. He promised to obtain sanction\\r\\nfrom his army commander to act on my left flank, but said that his\\r\\nhorses were too tired to move before the next day. Although he rendered\\r\\nme valuable assistance later on in the course of the retirement, he was\\r\\nunable, for the reasons given, to afford me any support on the most\\r\\ncritical day of all, viz., the 26th.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At daybreak it became apparent that the enemy was throwing the bulk of\\r\\nhis strength against the left of the position occupied by the Second\\r\\nCorps and the Fourth Division.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At this time the guns of four German army corps were in position\\r\\nagainst them, and Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien reported to me that he judged\\r\\nit impossible to continue his retirement at daybreak (as ordered) in\\r\\nface of such an attack.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I sent him orders to use his utmost endeavors to break off the action\\r\\nand retire at the earliest possible moment, as it was impossible for me\\r\\nto send him any support, the First Corps being at the moment incapable\\r\\nof movement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The French Cavalry Corps, under General Sordet, was coming up on our\\r\\nleft rear early in the morning, and I sent an urgent message to him to\\r\\ndo his utmost to come up and support the retirement of my left flank;\\r\\nbut owing to the fatigue of his horses he found himself unable to\\r\\nintervene in any way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There had been no time to intrench the position properly, but the\\r\\ntroops showed a magnificent front to the terrible fire which confronted\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The artillery, although outmatched by at least four to one, made a\\r\\nsplendid fight, and inflicted heavy losses on their opponents.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At length it became apparent that, if complete annihilation was to be\\r\\navoided, a retirement must be attempted; and the order was given to\\r\\ncommence it about 3.30 P. M. The movement was covered with the most\\r\\ndevoted intrepidity and determination by the artillery, which had itself\\r\\nsuffered heavily, and the fine work done by the cavalry in the further\\r\\nretreat from the position assisted materially in the final completion of\\r\\nthis most difficult and dangerous operation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fortunately the enemy had himself suffered too heavily to engage in an\\r\\nenergetic pursuit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot close the brief account of this glorious stand of the British\\r\\ntroops without putting on record my deep appreciation of the valuable\\r\\nservices rendered by Gen. Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say without hesitation that the saving of the left wing of the army\\r\\nunder my command on the morning of the 26th of August, could never have\\r\\nbeen accomplished unless a commander of rare and unusual coolness,\\r\\nintrepidity, and determination had been present to personally conduct\\r\\nthe operation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The retreat was continued far into the night of the 26th and through\\r\\nthe 27th and 28th, on which date the troops halted on the line\\r\\nNoyon-Chauny-LaFere, having then thrown off the weight of the enemy\\'s\\r\\npursuit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the 27th and 28th I was much indebted to General Sordet and the\\r\\nFrench Cavalry Division which he commands for materially assisting my\\r\\nretirement and successfully driving back some of the enemy on Cambrai.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This closes the period covering the heavy fighting which commenced at\\r\\nMons on Sunday afternoon, 23d August, and which really constituted a\\r\\nfour days\\' battle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is impossible for me to speak too highly of the skill evinced by the\\r\\ntwo general officers commanding army corps; the self-sacrificing and\\r\\ndevoted exertions of their staffs; the direction of the troops by\\r\\ndivisional, brigade, and regimental leaders; the command of the smaller\\r\\nunits by their officers; and the magnificent fighting spirit displayed\\r\\nby non-commissioned officers and men.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish particularly to bring to your Lordship\\'s notice the admirable\\r\\nwork done by the Royal Flying Corps under Sir David Henderson. Their\\r\\nskill, energy, and perseverance have been beyond all praise. They have\\r\\nfurnished me with the most complete and accurate information, which has\\r\\nbeen of incalculable value in the conduct of the operations. Fired at\\r\\nconstantly both by friend and foe, and not hesitating to fly in every\\r\\nkind of weather, they have remained undaunted throughout.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Further, by actually fighting in the air, they have succeeded in\\r\\ndestroying five of the enemy\\'s machines.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe combined French and British armies, including the forces that had\\r\\nretreated from Alsace and Lorraine, gave way with increasing\\r\\nstubbornness before von Kluck. That German general disregarding the\\r\\nfortresses surrounding Paris, swung southward to make a junction with\\r\\nthe Army of the Crown Prince of Germany advancing through the Vosges\\r\\nMountains. General Manoury\\'s army opposed the German advance on the\\r\\nentrenched line of Paris. General Gallieni commanding the garrison of\\r\\nParis, was ready with a novel mobile transport consisting of taxicabs\\r\\nand fast trucks. The total number of soldiers in the French and British\\r\\narmies now outnumbered those in the German armies opposed to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Joffre, in supreme command of the French, had chosen the\\r\\nbattleground.

As the tide of barbarity swept forward into\\r\\nNorthern France, stories of the horrors filtered through the close web\\r\\nof German censorship. There were denials at first by German\\r\\npropagandists. In the face of truth furnished by thousands of witnesses,\\r\\nthe denials faded away.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat caused these atrocities? Were they the spontaneous expression of\\r\\ndormant brutishness in German soldiers? Were they a sudden reversion of\\r\\nan entire nation to bestiality?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe answer is that the private soldier as an individual was not\\r\\nresponsible. The carnage, the rapine, the wholesale desolation was an\\r\\nintegral part of the German policy of schrecklichkeit or frightfulness.\\r\\nThis policy was laid down by Germany as part of its imperial war code.\\r\\nIn 1902 Germany issued a new war manual entitled \"Kriegsbrauch im\\r\\nLandkriege.\" In it is written this cold-blooded declaration:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll measures which conduce to the attainment of the object of war are\\r\\npermissible and these may be summarized in the two ideas of violence and\\r\\ncunning. What is permissible includes every means of war without which\\r\\nthe object of the war cannot be attained. All means which modern\\r\\ninvention affords, including the fullest, most dangerous, and most\\r\\nmassive means of destruction, may be utilized.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBrand Whitlock, United States Minister to Belgium, in a formal report to\\r\\nthe State Department, made this statement concerning Germany\\'s policy in\\r\\npermitting these outrages:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All these deliberate organized massacres of civilians, all these\\r\\nmurders and outrages, the violation of women, the killing of children,\\r\\nwanton destruction, burning, looting and pillage, and whole towns\\r\\ndestroyed, were acts for which no possible military necessity can be\\r\\npleaded. They were wilfully committed as part of a deliberately prepared\\r\\nand scientifically organized policy of terrorism.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Painting]\\r\\n  From a Painting by F.

The\\r\\nfirst document comes in the form of a cable sent from the Belgian\\r\\nMinister of Foreign Affairs under date of August 8,1914:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On Tuesday evening a body of German troops who had been driven back\\r\\nretired in disorder upon the town of Louvain. Germans who were guarding\\r\\nthe town thought that the retiring troops were Belgians and fired upon\\r\\nthem. In order to excuse this mistake the Germans, in spite of the most\\r\\nenergetic denials on the part of the authorities, pretended that\\r\\nBelgians had fired on the Germans, although all the inhabitants,\\r\\nincluding policemen, had been disarmed for more than a week. Without any\\r\\nexamination and without listening to any protest the commanding officer\\r\\nannounced that the town would be immediately destroyed. All inhabitants\\r\\nhad to leave their homes at once; some were made prisoners; women and\\r\\nchildren were put into a train of which the destination was unknown;\\r\\nsoldiers with fire bombs set fire to the different quarters of the town;\\r\\nthe splendid Church of St. Pierre, the markets, the university and its\\r\\nscientific establishments, were given to the flames, and it is probable\\r\\nthat the Hotel de Ville, this celebrated jewel of Gothic art, will also\\r\\nhave disappeared in the disaster. Several notabilities were shot at\\r\\nsight. Thus a town of 40,000 inhabitants, which, since the fifteenth\\r\\ncentury, has been the intellectual and scientific capital of the Low\\r\\nCountries is a heap of ashes. Americans, many of whom have followed the\\r\\ncourse at this illustrious alma mater and have there received such\\r\\ncordial hospitality, cannot remain insensible to this outrage on the\\r\\nrights of humanity and civilization which is unprecedented in history.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMinister Whitlock made the following report on the same outrage:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A violent fusillade broke out simultaneously at various points in the\\r\\ncity (Louvain), notably at the Porte de Bruxelles, Porte de Tirlemont,\\r\\nRue Leopold, Rue Marie-Therese, Rue des Joyeuses Entrees. German\\r\\nsoldiers were firing at random in every street and in every direction.\\r\\nLater fires broke out everywhere, notably in the University building,\\r\\nthe Library, in the old Church of St. Peter, in the Place du Peuple, in\\r\\nthe Rue de la Station, in the Boulevard de Tirlemont, and in the\\r\\nChaussee de Tirlemont. On the orders of their chiefs, the German\\r\\nsoldiers would break open the houses and set fire to them, shooting on\\r\\nthe inhabitants who tried to leave their dwellings. Many persons who\\r\\ntook refuge in their cellars were burned to death. The German soldiers\\r\\nwere equipped with apparatus for the purpose of firing dwellings,\\r\\nincendiary pastils, machines for spraying petroleum, etc. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Major von Manteuffel (of the German forces) sent for Alderman Schmidt.\\r\\nUpon the latter\\'s arrival, the major declared that hostages were to be\\r\\nheld, as sedition had just broken out. He asked Father Parijs, Mr.\\r\\nSchmidt, and Mgr. Coenraedts, First Vice-Rector of the University, who\\r\\nwas being held as a hostage, to make proclamations to the inhabitants\\r\\nexhorting them to be calm and menacing them with a fine of twenty\\r\\nmillion francs, the destruction of the city and the hanging of the\\r\\nhostages, if they created disturbance. Surrounded by about thirty\\r\\nsoldiers and a few officers, Major Manteuffel, Father Parijs, Mr.\\r\\nSchmidt and Mgr. Coenraedts left in the direction of the station, and\\r\\nthe alderman, in French, and the priest, in Flemish, made proclamations\\r\\nat the street corners.. . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Near the statue of Juste-Lipse, a Dr. Berghausen, a German surgeon, in\\r\\na highly excited condition, ran to meet the delegation. He shouted that\\r\\na German soldier had just been killed by a shot fired from the house of\\r\\nMr. David Fishbach. Addressing the soldiers, Dr. Berghausen said: \\'The\\r\\nblood of the entire population of Louvain is not worth a drop of the\\r\\nblood of a German soldier!\\' Then one of the soldiers threw into the\\r\\ninterior of the house of Mr. Fishbach one of the pastils which the\\r\\nGerman soldiers carried and immediately the house flared up. It\\r\\ncontained paintings of a high value. The old coachman, Joseph\\r\\nVandermosten, who had re-entered the house to try to save the life of\\r\\nhis master, did not return. His body was found the next day amidst the\\r\\nruins. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Germans made the usual claim that the civil population had fired\\r\\nupon them and that it was necessary to take these measures, i. e., burn\\r\\nthe churches, the library and other public monuments, burn and pillage\\r\\nhouses, driving out and murdering the inhabitants, sacking the city in\\r\\norder to punish and to spread terror among the people, and General von\\r\\nLuttwitz had told me that it was reported that the son of the\\r\\nburgomaster had shot one of their generals. But the burgomaster of\\r\\nLouvain had no son and no officer was shot at Louvain. The story of a\\r\\ngeneral shot by the son of a burgomaster was a repetition of a tragedy\\r\\nthat had occurred at Aerschot, on the 19th, where the fifteen-year-old\\r\\nson of the burgomaster had been killed by a firing squad, not because he\\r\\nhad shot a general, but because an officer had been shot, probably by\\r\\nBelgian soldiers retreating through the town. The story of this tragedy\\r\\nis told by the boy\\'s mother, under oath, before the Belgian Commission,\\r\\nand is so simple, so touching, so convincing in its verisimilitude, that\\r\\nI attach a copy of it in extenso to this report. It seems to afford an\\r\\naltogether typical example of what went on all over the stricken land\\r\\nduring those days of terror. (In other places it was the daughter of the\\r\\nburgomaster who was said to have shot a general.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The following facts may be noted: From the avowal of Prussian officers\\r\\nthemselves, there was not one single victim, among their men at the\\r\\nbarracks of St. Martin, Louvain, where it was claimed that the first\\r\\nshot had been fired from a house situated in front of the Caserne. This\\r\\nwould appear to be impossible had the civilians fired upon them point\\r\\nblank from across the street. It was said that when certain houses near\\r\\nthe barracks were burning, numerous explosions occurred, revealing the\\r\\npresence of cartridges; but these houses were drinking houses much\\r\\nfrequented by German soldiers. It was said that Spanish students shot\\r\\nfrom the schools in the Rue de la Station, but Father Catala, rector of\\r\\nthe school, affirms that the schools were empty. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If it was necessary, for whatever reason, to do what was done at Vise,\\r\\nat Dinant, at Aerschot, at Louvain, and in a hundred other towns that\\r\\nwere sacked, pillaged and burned, where masses were shot down because\\r\\ncivilians had fired on German troops, and if it was necessary to do this\\r\\non a scale never before witnessed in history, one might not unreasonably\\r\\nassume that the alleged firing by civilians was done on a scale, if not\\r\\nso thoroughly organized, at least somewhat in proportion to the rage of\\r\\ndestruction that punished it. And hence it would seem to be a simple\\r\\nmatter to produce at least convincing evidence that civilians had fired\\r\\non the soldiers; but there is no testimony to that effect beyond that of\\r\\nthe soldiers who merely assert it: Man hat geschossen. If there were no\\r\\nmore firing on soldiers by civilians in Belgium than is proved by the\\r\\nGerman testimony, it was not enough to justify the burning of the\\r\\nsmallest of the towns that was overtaken by that fate. And there is not\\r\\na scintilla of evidence of organized bands of francs-tireurs, such as\\r\\nwere found in the war of 1870.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder date of September 12, 1917, Minister Whitlock, in a report to the\\r\\nState Department of the United States, made the following summary: \"As\\r\\none studies the evidence at hand, one is struck at the outset by the\\r\\nfact so general that it must exclude the hypothesis of coincidence, and\\r\\nthat is that these wholesale massacres followed immediately upon some\\r\\ncheck, some reverse, that the German army had sustained. The German army\\r\\nwas checked by the guns of the forts to the east of Liege, and the\\r\\nhorrors of Vise, Verviers, Bligny, Battice, Hervy and twenty villages\\r\\nfollow. When they entered Liege, they burned the houses along two\\r\\nstreets and killed many persons, five or six Spaniards among them.\\r\\nChecked before Namur they sacked Andenne, Bouvignies, and Champignon,\\r\\nand when they took Namur they burned one hundred and fifty houses.\\r\\nCompelled to give battle to the French army in the Belgian Ardennes they\\r\\nravaged the beautiful valley of the Semois; the complete destruction of\\r\\nthe village of Rossignlo and the extermination of its entire male\\r\\npopulation took place there. Checked again by the French on the Meuse,\\r\\nthe awful carnage of Dinant results. Held on the Sambre by the French,\\r\\nthey burn one hundred houses at Charleroi and enact the appalling\\r\\ntragedy of Tamines. At Mons, the English hold them, and after that all\\r\\nover the Borinage there is a systematic destruction, pillage and murder.\\r\\nThe Belgian army drive them back from Malines and Louvain is doomed. The\\r\\nBelgian army failing back and fighting in retreat took refuge in the\\r\\nforts of Antwerp, and the burning and sack of Hougaerde, Wavre,\\r\\nOttignies, Grimde, Neerlinter, Weert, St. George, Shaffen and Aerschot\\r\\nfollow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Painting: Three soldiers in a bombed out shack, one on a\\r\\ntelephone.]\\r\\n  AN OBSERVATION POST\\r\\n  Watching the effect of gun fire from a sand-bagged ruin near the\\r\\n  German lines.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph of King and soldiers parading on horses.]\\r\\n  Photo by Trans-Atlantic News Service\\r\\n  KING ALBERT AT THE HEAD OF THE HEROIC SOLDIERS OF BELGIUM\\r\\n  It is universally agreed that the Belgian monarch was no figurehead\\r\\n  general but a real leader of his troops.

The gunners are endeavoring to pull the gun out with ropes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Belgian troops inflicted serious losses on the Germans in the South\\r\\nof the Province of Limbourg, and the towns of Lummen, Bilsen, and\\r\\nLanaeken are partially destroyed. Antwerp held out for two months, and\\r\\nall about its outer line of fortifications there was blood and fire,\\r\\nnumerous villages were sacked and burned and the whole town of Termonde\\r\\nwas destroyed. During the battles of September the village of\\r\\nBoortmeerbeek near Malines, occupied by the Germans, was retaken by the\\r\\nBelgians, and when the Germans entered it again they burned forty\\r\\nhouses. Three times occupied by the Belgians and retaken by the Germans\\r\\nBoortmeerbeek was three times punished in the same way. That is to say,\\r\\neverywhere the German army met with a defeat it took it out, as we say\\r\\nin America, on the civil population. And that is the explanation of the\\r\\nGerman atrocities in Belgium.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA committee of the highest honor and responsibility was appointed by the\\r\\nBritish Government to investigate the whole subject of atrocities in\\r\\nBelgium and Northern France. Its chairman was the Rt. Hon. Viscount\\r\\nJames Bryce, formerly British Ambassador to the United States. Its other\\r\\nmembers were the Rt. Hon. Sir Frederick Pollock, the Rt. Hon. Sir Edward\\r\\nClark, Sir Alfred Hopkinson, Mr. H. A. L. Fisher, Vice-Chancellor of the\\r\\nUniversity of Sheffield, Mr. Harold Cox and Sir Kenelm E. Digby.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe report of the commission bears upon its face the stamp of\\r\\npainstaking search for truth, substantiates every statement made by\\r\\nMinister Whitlock and makes known many horrible instances of cruelty and\\r\\nbarbarity. It makes the following deductions as having been proved\\r\\nbeyond question:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. That there were in many parts of Belgium deliberate and\\r\\nsystematically organized massacres of the civil population, accompanied\\r\\nby many isolated murders and other outrages.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. That in the conduct of the war generally innocent civilians, both men\\r\\nand women, were murdered in large numbers, women violated, and children\\r\\nmurdered.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. That looting, house burning, and the wanton destruction of property\\r\\nwere ordered and countenanced by the officers of the German army, that\\r\\nelaborate provision had been made for systematic incendiarism at the\\r\\nvery outbreak of the war, and that the burnings and destruction were\\r\\nfrequent where no military necessity could be alleged, being, indeed,\\r\\npart of a system of general terrorization.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. That the rules and usages of war were frequently broken, particularly\\r\\nby the using of civilians, including women and children, as a shield for\\r\\nadvancing forces exposed to fire, to a less degree by killing the\\r\\nwounded and prisoners and in the frequent abuse of the Red Cross and the\\r\\nwhite flag.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bryce Commission\\'s report on the destruction of Dinant is an example of\\r\\ntestimony laid before them. It follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A clear statement of the outrages at Dinant, which many travelers will\\r\\nrecall as a singularly picturesque town on the Meuse, is given by one\\r\\nwitness, who says that the Germans began burning houses in the Rue St.\\r\\nJacques on the 21st of August, and that every house in the street was\\r\\nburned. On the following day an engagement took place between the French\\r\\nand the Germans, and the witness spent the whole day in the cellar of a\\r\\nbank with his wife and children. On the morning of the 23d, about 5\\r\\no\\'clock, firing ceased, and almost immediately afterward a party of\\r\\nGermans came to the house. They rang the bell and began to batter at the\\r\\ndoor and windows. The witness\\' wife went to the door and two or three\\r\\nGermans came in. The family were ordered out into the street. There they\\r\\nfound another family, and the two families were driven with their hands\\r\\nabove their heads along the Rue Grande. All the houses in the street\\r\\nwere burning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The party was eventually put into a forge where there were a number of\\r\\nother prisoners, about a hundred in all, and were kept there from 11 A.\\r\\nM. till 2 P. M. They were then taken to the prison. There they were\\r\\nassembled in a courtyard and searched. No arms were found. They were\\r\\nthen passed through into the prison itself and put into cells. The\\r\\nwitness and his wife were separated from each other. During the next\\r\\nhour the witness heard rifle shots continually and noticed in the corner\\r\\nof a courtyard leading off the row of cells the body of a young man with\\r\\na mantle thrown over it. He recognized the mantle as having belonged to\\r\\nhis wife. The witness\\' daughter was allowed to go out to see what had\\r\\nhappened to her mother, and the witness himself was allowed to go across\\r\\nthe courtyard half an hour afterward for the same purpose. He found his\\r\\nwife lying on the floor in a room. She had bullet wounds in four places\\r\\nbut was alive and told her husband to return to the children and he did\\r\\nso.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About 5 o\\'clock in the evening, he saw the Germans bringing out all the\\r\\nyoung and middle-aged men from the cells, and ranging their prisoners,\\r\\nto the number of forty, in three rows in the middle of the courtyard.\\r\\nAbout twenty Germans were drawn up opposite, but before anything was\\r\\ndone there was a tremendous fusillade from some point near the prison\\r\\nand the civilians were hurried back to their cells. Half an hour later\\r\\nthe same forty men were brought back into the courtyard. Almost\\r\\nimmediately there was a second fusillade and they were driven back to\\r\\nthe cells again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About 7 o\\'clock the witness and other prisoners were brought out of\\r\\ntheir cells and marched out of the prison. They went between two lines\\r\\nof troops to Roche Bayard, about a kilometer away. An hour later the\\r\\nwomen and children were separated and the prisoners were brought back to\\r\\nDinant passing the prison on their way. Just outside the prison, the\\r\\nwitness saw three lines of bodies which he recognized as being those of\\r\\nhis neighbors. They were nearly all dead, but he noticed movement in\\r\\nsome of them. There were about one hundred and twenty bodies. The\\r\\nprisoners were then taken up to the top of a hill outside Dinant and\\r\\ncompelled to stay there till 8 o\\'clock in the morning. On the following\\r\\nday they were put into cattle trucks and taken thence to Coblenz. For\\r\\nthree months they remained prisoners in Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Unarmed civilians were killed in masses at other places near the\\r\\nprison. About ninety bodies were seen lying on the top of one another in\\r\\na grass square opposite the convent. A witness asked a German officer\\r\\nwhy her husband had been shot, and he told her that it was because two\\r\\nof her sons had been in the civil guard and had shot at the Germans. As\\r\\na matter of fact, one of her sons was at that time in Liege and the\\r\\nother in Brussels. It is stated that besides the ninety corpses referred\\r\\nto above, sixty corpses of civilians were recovered from a hole in the\\r\\nbrewery yard and that forty-eight bodies of women and children were\\r\\nfound in a garden. The town was systematically set on fire by hand\\r\\ngrenades. Another witness saw a little girl of seven, one of whose legs\\r\\nwas broken and the other injured by a bayonet. We have no reason to\\r\\nbelieve that the civilian population of Dinant gave any provocation, or\\r\\nthat any other defense can be put forward to justify the treatment\\r\\ninflicted upon its citizens.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bryce Commission reports the outrages in a number of Belgian\\r\\nvillages in this terse fashion:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In Hofstade a number of houses had been set on fire and many corpses\\r\\nwere seen, some in houses, some in back yards, and some in the streets.\\r\\nTwo witnesses speak of having seen the body of a young man pierced by\\r\\nbayonet thrusts with the wrists cut also. On a side road the corpse of a\\r\\ncivilian was seen on his doorstep with a bayonet wound in his stomach\\r\\nand by his side the dead body of a boy of five or six with his hands\\r\\nnearly severed. The corpses of a woman and boy were seen at the\\r\\nblacksmith\\'s. They had been killed with the bayonet. In a cafe, a young\\r\\nman, also killed with the bayonet, was holding his hands together as if\\r\\nin the attitude of supplication.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the garden of a house in the main street, bodies of two women were\\r\\nobserved, and in another house, the body of a boy of sixteen with two\\r\\nbayonet wounds in the chest. In Sempst a similar condition of affairs\\r\\nexisted. Houses were burning and in some of them were the charred\\r\\nremains of civilians. In a bicycle shop a witness saw the burned corpse\\r\\nof a man. Other witnesses speak of this incident. Another civilian,\\r\\nunarmed, was shot as he was running away. As will be remembered, all the\\r\\narms had been given up some time before by the order of the burgomaster.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At Weerde four corpses of civilians were lying in the road. It was said\\r\\nthat these men had fired upon the German soldiers; but this is denied.\\r\\nThe arms had been given up long before. Two children were killed in the\\r\\nvillage of Weerde, quite wantonly as they were standing in the road with\\r\\ntheir mother. They were three or four years old and were killed with the\\r\\nbayonet. A small barn burning close by formed a convenient means of\\r\\ngetting rid of bodies. They were thrown into the flames from the\\r\\nbayonets. It is right to add that no commissioned officer was present at\\r\\nthe time. At Eppeghem, on August 25th, a pregnant woman who had been\\r\\nwounded with a bayonet was discovered in the convent. She was dying. On\\r\\nthe road six dead bodies of laborers were seen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At Boortmeerbeek a German soldier was seen to fire three times at a\\r\\nlittle girl five years old. Having failed to hit her, he subsequently\\r\\nbayoneted her. He was killed with the butt end of a rifle by a Belgian\\r\\nsoldier who had seen him commit this murder from a distance. At Herent\\r\\nthe charred body of a civilian was found in a butcher\\'s shop, and in a\\r\\nhandcart twenty yards away was the dead body of a laborer. Two eye\\r\\nwitnesses relate that a German soldier shot a civilian and stabbed him\\r\\nwith a bayonet as he lay. He then made one of these witnesses, a\\r\\ncivilian prisoner, smell the blood on the bayonet. At Haecht the bodies\\r\\nof ten civilians were seen lying in a row by a brewery wall. In a\\r\\nlaborer\\'s house, which had been broken up, the mutilated corpse of a\\r\\nwoman of thirty to thirty-five was discovered.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nConcerning the treatment of women and children in general, the report\\r\\ncontinues: \"The evidence shows that the German authorities, when\\r\\ncarrying out a policy of systematic arson and plunder in selected\\r\\ndistricts, usually drew some distinction between the adult male\\r\\npopulation on the one hand and the women and children on the other. It\\r\\nwas a frequent practice to set apart the adult males of the condemned\\r\\ndistrict with a view to the execution of a suitable number--preferably\\r\\nof the younger and more vigorous--and to reserve the women and children\\r\\nfor milder treatment. The depositions, however, present many instances\\r\\nof calculated cruelty, often going the length of murder, toward the\\r\\nwomen and children of the condemned area.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At Dinant sixty women and children were confined in the cellar of a\\r\\nconvent from Sunday morning till the following Friday, August 28th,\\r\\nsleeping on the ground, for there were no beds, with nothing to drink\\r\\nduring the whole period, and given no food until Wednesday, when\\r\\nsomebody threw into the cellar two sticks of macaroni and a carrot for\\r\\neach prisoner. In other cases the women and children were marched for\\r\\nlong distances along roads, as, for instance, the march of the women\\r\\nfrom Louvain to Tirlemont, August 28th, the laggards pricked on by the\\r\\nattendant Uhlans. A lady complains of having been brutally kicked by\\r\\nprivates. Others were struck at with the butt end of rifles. At Louvain,\\r\\nat Liege, at Aerschot, at Malines, at Montigny, at Andenne, and\\r\\nelsewhere, there is evidence that the troops were not restrained from\\r\\ndrunkenness, and drunken soldiers cannot be trusted to observe the rules\\r\\nor decencies of war, least of all when they are called upon to execute a\\r\\npreordained plan of arson and pillage. From the very first women were\\r\\nnot safe. At Liege women and children were chased about the streets by\\r\\nsoldiers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Witnesses recount how a great crowd of men, women and children from\\r\\nAerschot were marched to Louvain, and then suddenly exposed to a fire\\r\\nfrom a mitrailleuse and rifles. \\'We were all placed,\\' recounts a\\r\\nsufferer, \\'in Station Street, Louvain, and the German soldiers fired on\\r\\nus. I saw the corpses of some women in the street. I fell down, and a\\r\\nwoman who had been shot fell on top of me.\\' Women and children suddenly\\r\\nturned out into the streets, and, compelled to witness the destruction\\r\\nof their homes by fire, provided a sad spectacle to such as were sober\\r\\nenough to see.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A humane German officer, witnessing the ruin of Aerschot, exclaimed in\\r\\ndisgust: \\'I am a father myself, and I cannot bear this. It is not war\\r\\nbut butchery.\\' Officers as well as men succumbed to the temptation of\\r\\ndrink, with results which may be illustrated by an incident which\\r\\noccurred at Campenhout. In this village there was a certain well-to-do\\r\\nmerchant (name given) who had a cellar of good champagne. On the\\r\\nafternoon of the 14th or 15th of August three German cavalry officers\\r\\nentered the house and demanded champagne. Having drunk ten bottles and\\r\\ninvited five or six officers and three or four private soldiers to join\\r\\nthem, they continued their carouse, and then called for the master and\\r\\nmistress of the house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Immediately my mistress came in,\\' says the valet de chambre, \\'one of\\r\\nthe officers who was sitting on the floor got up, and, putting a\\r\\nrevolver to my mistress\\' temple, shot her dead. The officer was\\r\\nobviously drunk. The other officers continued to drink and sing, and\\r\\nthey did not pay any great attention to the killing of my mistress. The\\r\\nofficer who shot my mistress then told my master to dig a grave and bury\\r\\nmy mistress. My master and the officer went into the garden, the officer\\r\\nthreatening my master with a pistol. My master was then forced to dig\\r\\nthe grave and to bury my mistress in it. I cannot say for what reason\\r\\nthey killed my mistress. The officer who did it was singing all the\\r\\ntime.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the evidence before us there are cases tending to show that\\r\\naggravated crimes against women were sometimes severely punished. One\\r\\nwitness reports that a young girl who was being pursued by a drunken\\r\\nsoldier at Louvain appealed to a German officer, and that the offender\\r\\nwas then and there shot. Another describes how an officer of the\\r\\nThirty-second Regiment of the Line was led out to execution for the\\r\\nviolation of two young girls, but reprieved at the request or with the\\r\\nconsent of the girls\\' mother. These instances are sufficient to show\\r\\nthat the maltreatment of women was no part of the military scheme of the\\r\\ninvaders, however much it may appear to have been the inevitable result\\r\\nof the system of terror deliberately adopted in certain regions. Indeed,\\r\\nso much is avowed. \\'I asked the commander why we had been spared,\\' says\\r\\na lady in Louvain, who deposes to having suffered much brutal treatment\\r\\nduring the sack. He said: \\'We will not hurt you any more. Stay in\\r\\nLouvain. All is finished.\\' It was Saturday, August 29th, and the reign\\r\\nof terror was over.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Germans used men, women and children of Belgium as screens for\\r\\nadvancing infantry, as is shown in the following: Outside Fort Fleron,\\r\\nnear Liege, men and children were marched in front of the Germans to\\r\\nprevent the Belgian soldiers from firing. The progress of the Germans\\r\\nthrough Mons was marked by many incidents of this character. Thus, on\\r\\nAugust 22d, half a dozen Belgian colliers returning from work were\\r\\nmarching in front of some German troops who were pursuing the English,\\r\\nand in the opinion of the witnesses, they must have been placed there\\r\\nintentionally. An English officer describes how he caused a barricade to\\r\\nbe erected in a main thoroughfare leading out of Mons, when the Germans,\\r\\nin order to reach a crossroad in the rear, fetched civilians out of the\\r\\nhouses on each side of the main road and compelled them to hold up white\\r\\nflags and act as cover.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Another British officer who saw this incident is convinced that the\\r\\nGermans were acting deliberately for the purpose of protecting\\r\\nthemselves from the fire of the British troops. Apart from this\\r\\nprotection, the Germans could not have advanced, as the street was\\r\\nstraight and commanded by the British rifle fire at a range of 700 or\\r\\n800 yards. Several British soldiers also speak of this incident, and\\r\\ntheir story is confirmed by a Flemish witness in a side street.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French Government also appointed a commission, headed by M. Georges\\r\\nPayelle. This body made an investigation of outrages committed by German\\r\\nofficers and soldiers in Northern France. Its report showed conditions\\r\\nthat outstripped in horror the war tactics of savages. It makes the\\r\\nfollowing accusations:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In Rebais, two English cavalrymen who were surprised and wounded in\\r\\nthis commune were finished off with gunshots by the Germans when they\\r\\nwere dismounted and when one of them had thrown up his hands, showing\\r\\nthus that he was unarmed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the department of the Marne, as everywhere else, the German troops\\r\\ngave themselves up to general pillage, which was carried out always\\r\\nunder similar conditions and with the complicity of their leaders. The\\r\\nCommunes of Heiltz-le-Maurupt, Suippes, Marfaux, Fromentieres and\\r\\nEsternay suffered especially in this way. Everything which the invader\\r\\ncould carry off from the houses was placed on motor lorries and\\r\\nvehicles. At Suippes, in particular, they carried off in this way a\\r\\nquantity of different objects, among these sewing machines and toys. A\\r\\ngreat many villages, as well as important country towns, were burned\\r\\nwithout any reason whatever. Without doubt, these crimes were committed\\r\\nby order, as German detachments arrived in the neighborhood with their\\r\\ntorches, their grenades, and their usual outfit for arson.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At Marfaux nineteen private houses were burned. Of the Commune of\\r\\nGlannes practically nothing remains. At Somme-Tourbe the entire village\\r\\nhas been destroyed, with the exception of the Mairie, the church and two\\r\\nprivate buildings. At Auve nearly the whole town has been destroyed. At\\r\\nEtrepy sixty-three families out of seventy are homeless. At Huiron all\\r\\nof the houses, with the exception of five have been burned. At\\r\\nSermaize-les-Bains only about forty houses out of 900 remain. At\\r\\nBignicourt-sur-Saultz thirty houses out of thirty-three are in ruins.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At Suippes, the big market town which has been practically burned out,\\r\\nGerman soldiers carrying straw and cans of petrol have been seen in the\\r\\nstreets. While the mayor\\'s house was burning, six sentinels with fixed\\r\\nbayonets were under orders to forbid anyone to approach and to prevent\\r\\nany help being given.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All this destruction by arson, which only represents a small proportion\\r\\nof the acts of the same kind in the Department of Seine-et-Marne, was\\r\\naccomplished without the least tendency to rebellion or the smallest act\\r\\nof resistance being recorded against the inhabitants of the localities\\r\\nwhich are today more or less completely destroyed. In some villages the\\r\\nGermans, before setting fire to them made one of their soldiers fire a\\r\\nshot from his rifle so as to be able to pretend afterward that the\\r\\ncivilian population had attacked them, an allegation which is all the\\r\\nmore absurd since at the time when the enemy arrived, the only\\r\\ninhabitants left were old men, sick persons, or people absolutely\\r\\nwithout any means of aggression.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Painting]\\r\\n  THE HORRORS OF GERMAN RULE IN FRANCE\\r\\n  Forcibly removing French civilians from Lille to German labor\\r\\n  colonies.

In the\\r\\nmajority of the communes hostages have been taken away; many of them\\r\\nhave not returned. At Sermaize-les-Bains, the Germans carried off about\\r\\none hundred and fifty people, some of whom were decked out with helmets\\r\\nand coats and compelled, thus equipped, to mount guard over the bridges.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At Bignicourt-sur-Saultz thirty men and forty-five women and children\\r\\nwere obliged to leave with a detachment. One of the men--a certain Emile\\r\\nPierre--has not returned nor sent any news of himself. At Corfelix, M.\\r\\nJacqet, who was carried off on the 7th of September with eleven of his\\r\\nfellow-citizens, was found five hundred meters from the village with a\\r\\nbullet in his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At Champuis, the cure, his maid-servant, and four other inhabitants who\\r\\nwere taken away on the same day as the hostages of Corfelix had not\\r\\nreturned at the time of our visit to the place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At the same place an old man of seventy, named Jacquemin, was tied down\\r\\nin his bed by an officer and left in this state without food for three\\r\\ndays. He died a little time after. At Vert-la-Gravelle a farm hand was\\r\\nkilled. He was struck on the head with a bottle and his chest was run\\r\\nthrough with a lance. The garde champetre Brulefer of le Gault-la-Foret\\r\\nwas murdered at Maclaunay, where he had been taken by the Germans. His\\r\\nbody was found with his head shattered and a wound on his chest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At Champguyon, a commune which has been fired, a certain Verdier was\\r\\nkilled in his father-in-law\\'s house.

It must have been consumed in the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At Sermaize, the roadmaker, Brocard, was placed among a number of\\r\\nhostages. Just at the moment when he was being arrested with his son,\\r\\nhis wife and his daughter-in-law in a state of panic rushed to throw\\r\\nthemselves into the Saulx. The old man was able to free himself for a\\r\\nmoment and ran in all haste after them and made several attempts to save\\r\\nthem, but the Germans dragged him away pitilessly, leaving the two\\r\\nwretched women struggling in the river. When Brocard and his son were\\r\\nrestored to liberty, four days afterward, and found the bodies, they\\r\\ndiscovered that their wives had both received bullet wounds in the head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At Triaucourt the Germans gave themselves up to the worst excesses.\\r\\nAngered doubtless by the remark which an officer had addressed to a\\r\\nsoldier, against whom a young girl of nineteen, Mlle. Helene Proces, had\\r\\nmade complaint of on account of the indecent treatment to which she had\\r\\nbeen subjected, they burned the village and made a systematic massacre\\r\\nof the inhabitants. They began by setting fire to the house of an\\r\\ninoffensive householder, M. Jules Gand, and by shooting this unfortunate\\r\\nman as he was leaving his house to escape the flames. Then they\\r\\ndispersed among the houses in the streets, firing off their rifles on\\r\\nevery side. A young man, seventeen years, Georges Lecourtier, who tried\\r\\nto escape, was shot. M. Alfred Lallemand suffered the same fate. He was\\r\\npursued into the kitchen of his fellow-citizen Tautelier, and murdered\\r\\nthere, while Tautelier received three bullets in his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fearing, not without reason, for their lives, Mlle. Proces, her mother\\r\\nand her grandmother of seventy-one and her old aunt of eighty-one, tried\\r\\nto cross the trellis which separates their garden from a neighboring\\r\\nproperty with the help of a ladder. The young girl alone was able to\\r\\nreach the other side and to avoid death by hiding in the cabbages. As\\r\\nfor the other women, they were struck down by rifle shots. The village\\r\\ncure collected the brains of the aunt on the ground on which they were\\r\\nstrewn and had the bodies carried into Proces\\' house. During the\\r\\nfollowing night, the Germans played the piano near the bodies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"While the carnage raged, the fire rapidly spread and devoured\\r\\nthirty-five houses. An old man of seventy and a child of two months\\r\\nperished in the flames. M. Igier, who was trying to save his cattle, was\\r\\npursued for 300 meters by soldiers, who fired at him ceaselessly.

Autocracy was destroyed by Foch\\r\\nat the second battle of the Marne, in July, 1918.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis in a nutshell embraces the dramatic opening and closing episodes of\\r\\nthe World War on the soil of France. Bracketed between these two\\r\\nglorious victories were the agonies of martyred France, the deaths and\\r\\nlife-long cripplings of millions of men, the up-rooting of arrogant\\r\\nmilitarism, the liberation of captive nations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first battle of the Marne was wholly a French operation. The British\\r\\nwere close at hand, but had no share in the victory. Generals Gallieni\\r\\nand Manoury, acting under instructions from Marshal Joffre, were driven\\r\\nby automobile to the headquarters of the British commander, Sir John\\r\\nFrench, in the village of Melun. They explained in detail General\\r\\nJoffre\\'s plan of attack upon the advancing German army. An urgent\\r\\nrequest was made that the British army halt its retreat, face about, and\\r\\nattack the two corps of von Kluck\\'s army then confronting the British.\\r\\nSimultaneously with this attack General Manoury\\'s forces were to fall\\r\\nupon the flank and the rear guard of von Kluck along the River Ourcq.\\r\\nThis operation was planned for the next day, September 5th. Sir John\\r\\nFrench replied that he could not get his tired army in readiness for\\r\\nbattle within forty-eight hours. This would delay the British attack in\\r\\nall probability until September 7th.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoffre\\'s plan of battle, however, would admit of no delay. The case was\\r\\nurgent; there was grave danger of a union between the great forces\\r\\nheaded by the Crown Prince and those under von Kluck. He resolved to go\\r\\nahead without the British, and ordered Manoury to strike as had been\\r\\nplanned.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe fixed as an extreme limit for the movement of retreat, which was\\r\\nstill going on, the line of Bray-sur-Seine, Nogent-sur-Seine,\\r\\nArcis-sur-Aube, Vitry-le-Francois, and the region to the north of\\r\\nBar-le-Duc. This line might be reached if the troops were compelled to\\r\\ngo back so far. They would attack before reaching it, as soon as there\\r\\nwas a possibility of bringing about an offensive disposition, permitting\\r\\nthe co-operation of the whole of the French forces. On September 5 it\\r\\nappeared that this desired situation existed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph]\\r\\n  Copyright Underwood and Underwood, N.Y.\\r\\n  GENERAL PERSHING AND MARSHAL JOFFRE\\r\\n  The Commander-in-Chief of the American Expeditionary Forces chatting\\r\\n  with the veteran Marshal of France, the hero of the first battle of\\r\\n  the Marne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph]\\r\\n  MARSHAL FERDINAND FOCH, GENERALISSIMO OF THE ALLIED ARMIES\\r\\n  No leader could command greater confidence than the brilliant\\r\\n  strategist to whom was mainly due the great victory of the Marne in\\r\\n  the first autumn of the war. He also directed the French offensive on\\r\\n  the Somme in 1916 and in November, 1917, he was chosen as the French\\r\\n  representative and subsequently chairman of the Central Military\\r\\n  Committee appointed to assist the Supreme Allied War Council. Marshal\\r\\n  Foch was formerly for five years lecturer on strategy and tactics at\\r\\n  the Ecole de Guerre. At the close of the war he said to the Allied\\r\\n  armies: \"You have won the greatest battle in history and saved the\\r\\n  most sacred cause--the liberty of the world,\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map; Paris in the lower left corner, showing various\\r\\nbattle lines Eastward to Luxumburg.]\\r\\n  THE FIRST GERMAN DASH FOR PARIS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe First German army, carrying audacity to temerity, had continued its\\r\\nendeavor to envelop the French left, had crossed the Grand Morin, and\\r\\nreached the region of Chauffry, to the south of Rebais and of Esternay.\\r\\nIt aimed then at cutting Joffre off from Paris, in order to begin the\\r\\ninvestment of the capital.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Second army had its head on the line Champaubert, Etoges, Bergeres,\\r\\nand Vertus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Third and Fourth armies reached to Chalons-sur-Marne and\\r\\nBussy-le-Repos. The Fifth army was advancing on one side and the other\\r\\nfrom the Argonne as far as Triacourt-les-Islettes and Juivecourt. The\\r\\nSixth and Seventh armies were attacking more to the east.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French left army had been able to occupy the line Sezanne,\\r\\nVillers-St. Georges and Courchamps. This was precisely the disposition\\r\\nwhich the General-in-Chief had wished to see achieved. On the 4th he\\r\\ndecided to take advantage of it, and ordered all the armies to hold\\r\\nthemselves ready. He had taken from his right two new army corps, two\\r\\ndivisions of infantry, and two divisions of cavalry, which were\\r\\ndistributed between his left and his center.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the evening of the 5th he addressed to all the commanders of armies a\\r\\nmessage ordering them to attack.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The hour has come,\" he wrote, \"to advance at all costs, and to die\\r\\nwhere you stand rather than give way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIf one examines the map, it will be seen that by his inflection toward\\r\\nMeaux and Coulommiers General von Kluck was exposing his right to the\\r\\noffensive action of the French left. This is the starting point of the\\r\\nvictory of the Marne.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the evening of September 5th the French left army had reached the\\r\\nfront Penchard-Saint-Souflet-Ver. On the 6th and 7th it continued its\\r\\nattacks vigorously with the Ourcq as objective. On the evening of the\\r\\n7th it was some kilometers from the Ourcq, on the front\\r\\nChambry-Marcilly-Lisieux-Acy-en-Multien. On the 8th, the Germans, who\\r\\nhad in great haste reinforced their right by bringing their Second and\\r\\nFourth army corps back to the north, obtained some successes by attacks\\r\\nof extreme violence. But in spite of this pressure the French held their\\r\\nground. In a brilliant action they took three standards, and being\\r\\nreinforced prepared a new attack for the 10th. At the moment that this\\r\\nattack was about to begin the enemy was already in retreat toward the\\r\\nnorth. The attack became a pursuit, and on the 12th the French\\r\\nestablished themselves on the Aisne.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy did the German forces which were confronting the French, and on the\\r\\nevening before attacking so furiously, retreat on the morning of the\\r\\n10th? Because in bringing back on the 6th several army corps from the\\r\\nsouth to the north to face the French left, the enemy had exposed his\\r\\nleft to the attacks of the now rested British, who had immediately faced\\r\\naround toward the north, and to those of the French armies which were\\r\\nprolonging the English lines to the right. This is what the French\\r\\ncommand had sought to bring about. This is what happened on September\\r\\n8th and allowed the development and rehabilitation which it was to\\r\\neffect.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 6th the British army set out from the line Rozcy-Lagny and that\\r\\nevening reached the southward bank of the Grand Morin. On the 7th and\\r\\n8th it continued its march, and on the 9th had debouched to the north of\\r\\nthe Marne below Chauteau-Thierry--the town that was to become famous\\r\\nfor the American stand in 1918--taking in flank the German forces which\\r\\non that day were opposing, on the Ourcq, the French left army. Then it\\r\\nwas that these forces began to retreat, while the British army, going in\\r\\npursuit and capturing seven guns and many prisoners, reached the Aisne\\r\\nbetween Soissons and Longueval.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe role of the French army, which was operating to the right of the\\r\\nBritish army, was threefold. It had to support the British attacking on\\r\\nits left. It had on its right to support the center, which, from\\r\\nSeptember 7th, had been subjected to a German attack of great violence.\\r\\nFinally, its mission was to throw back the three active army corps and\\r\\nthe reserve corps which faced it.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 7th, it made a leap forward, and on the following days reached\\r\\nand crossed the Marne, seizing, after desperate fighting, guns,\\r\\nhowitzers, mitrailleuses, and a million cartridges. On the 12th it\\r\\nestablished itself on the north edge of the Montagne-de-Reime in contact\\r\\nwith the French center, which for its part had just forced the enemy to\\r\\nretreat in haste.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French center consisted of a new army created on August 29th and of\\r\\none of those which at the beginning of the campaign had been engaged in\\r\\nBelgian Luxemburg. The first had retreated, on August 29th to September\\r\\n5th, from the Aisne to the north of the Marne and occupied the general\\r\\nfront Sezanne-Mailly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second, more to the east, had drawn back to the south of the line\\r\\nHumbauville-Chateau-Beauchamp-Bignicourt-Blesmes-Maurupt-le-Montoy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe enemy, in view of his right being arrested and the defeat of his\\r\\nenveloping movement, made a desperate effort from the 7th to the 19th to\\r\\npierce the French center to the west and to the east of\\r\\nFere-Champenoise. On the 8th he succeeded in forcing back the right of\\r\\nthe new French army, which retired as far as Gouragancon. On the 9th, at\\r\\n6 o\\'clock in the morning, there was a further retreat to the south of\\r\\nthat village, while on the left the other army corps also had to go back\\r\\nto the line Allemant-Connantre.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite this retreat General Foch, commanding the army of the center,\\r\\nordered a general offensive for the same day. With the Morocco division,\\r\\nwhose behavior was heroic, he met a furious assault of the Germans on\\r\\nhis left toward the marshes of Saint Gond. Then, with the divisions\\r\\nwhich had just victoriously overcome the attacks of the enemy to the\\r\\nnorth of Sezanne, and with the whole of his left army corps, he made a\\r\\nflanking attack in the evening of the 9th upon the German forces, and\\r\\nnotably the guard, which had thrown back his right army corps. The\\r\\nenemy, taken by surprise by this bold maneuver, did not resist, and beat\\r\\na hasty retreat. This marked Foch as the most daring and brilliant\\r\\nstrategist of the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 11th the French crossed the Marne between Tours-sur-Marne and\\r\\nSarry, driving the Germans in front of them in disorder. On the 12th\\r\\nthey were in contact with the enemy to the north of the Camp de Chalons.\\r\\nThe reserve army of the center, acting on the right of the one just\\r\\nreferred to, had been intrusted with the mission during the 7th, 8th,\\r\\nand 9th of disengaging its neighbor, and it was only on the 10th that\\r\\nbeing reinforced by an army corps from the east, it was able to make its\\r\\naction effectively felt. On the 11th the Germans retired. But,\\r\\nperceiving their danger, they fought desperately, with enormous\\r\\nexpenditure of projectiles, behind strong intrenchments. On the 12th the\\r\\nresult had none the less been attained, and the two French center armies\\r\\nwere solidly established on the ground gained.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the right of these two armies were three others. They had orders to\\r\\ncover themselves to the north and to debouch toward the west on the\\r\\nflank of the enemy, which was operating to the west of the Argonne. But\\r\\na wide interval in which the Germans were in force separated them from\\r\\nthe French center. The attack took place, nevertheless, with very\\r\\nbrilliant success for the French artillery, which destroyed eleven\\r\\nbatteries of the Sixteenth German army corps.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 10th inst., the Eighth and Fifteenth German army corps\\r\\ncounter-attacked, but were repulsed. On the 11th French progress\\r\\ncontinued with new successes, and on the 12th the French were able to\\r\\nface round toward the north in expectation of the near and inevitable\\r\\nretreat of the enemy, which, in fact, took place from the 13th.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe withdrawal of the mass of the German force involved also that of the\\r\\nleft. From the 12th onward the forces of the enemy operating between\\r\\nNancy and the Vosges retreated in a hurry before the two French armies\\r\\nof the East, which immediately occupied the positions that the enemy had\\r\\nevacuated. The offensive of the French right had thus prepared and\\r\\nconsolidated in the most useful way the result secured by the left and\\r\\ncenter.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was this seven days\\' battle, in which more than two millions of men\\r\\nwere engaged. Each army gained ground step by step, opening the road to\\r\\nits neighbor, supported at once by it, taking in flank the adversary\\r\\nwhich the day before it had attacked in front, the efforts of one\\r\\narticulating closely with those of the other, a perfect unity of\\r\\nintention and method animating the supreme command.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo give this victory all its meaning it is necessary to add that it was\\r\\ngained by troops which for two weeks had been retreating, and which,\\r\\nwhen the order for the offensive was given, were found to be as ardent\\r\\nas on the first day. It has also to be said that these troops had to\\r\\nmeet the whole Germany army. Under their pressure the German retreat at\\r\\ncertain times had the appearance of a rout.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of the fatigue of the poilus, in spite of the power of the\\r\\nGerman heavy artillery, the French took colors, guns, mitrailleuses,\\r\\nshells, and thousands of prisoners. One German corps lost almost the\\r\\nwhole of its artillery.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn that great battle the spectacular rush of General Gallieni\\'s army\\r\\ndefending Paris, was one of the dramatic surprises that decided the\\r\\nissue. In that stroke Gallieni sent his entire force forty miles to\\r\\nattack the right wing of the German army. In this gigantic maneuver\\r\\nevery motor car in Paris was utilized, and the flying force of Gallieni\\r\\nbecame the \"Army in Taxicabs,\" a name that will live as long as France\\r\\nexists.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Clergerie, Chief of Staff to Gallieni told the story for\\r\\nposterity. He said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From August 26, 1914, the German armies had been descending upon Paris\\r\\nby forced marches. On September 1st they were only three days\\' march\\r\\nfrom the advanced line of the intrenched camp, which the garrison were\\r\\nlaboring desperately to put into condition for defense. It was necessary\\r\\nto cover with trenches a circuit of 110 miles, install siege guns,\\r\\nassure the coming of supplies for them over narrow-gauge railways,\\r\\nassemble the food and provisions of all kinds necessary for a city of\\r\\n4,000,000 inhabitants.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But on September 3d, the intelligence service, which was working\\r\\nperfectly, stated, about the middle of the day, that the German columns,\\r\\nafter heading straight for Paris, were swerving toward the southeast and\\r\\nseemed to wish to avoid the fortified camp.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"General Gallieni and I then had one of those long conferences which\\r\\ndenoted grave events; they usually lasted from two to five minutes at\\r\\nmost. The fact is that the military government of Paris did little\\r\\ntalking--it acted. The conference reached this conclusion: \\'If they do\\r\\nnot come to us, we will go to them with all the force we can muster.\\'\\r\\nNothing remained but to make the necessary preparations. The first thing\\r\\nto do was not to give the alarm to the enemy. General Manoury\\'s army\\r\\nimmediately received orders to lie low and avoid any engagement that was\\r\\nnot absolutely necessary.\" Then care was taken to reinforce it by every\\r\\nmeans. All was ready at the designated time.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the night of September 3d, knowing that the enemy would have to leave\\r\\nonly a rear guard on one bank of the Ourcq, General Gallieni and General\\r\\nClergerie decided to march against that rear guard, to drive it back\\r\\nwith all the weight of the Manoury army, to cut the enemy\\'s\\r\\ncommunications, and take full advantage of his hazardous situation.\\r\\nImmediately the following order was addressed to General Manoury:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of the movement of the German armies, which seem to be slipping\\r\\nin before our front to the southeast, I intend to send your army to\\r\\nattack them in the flank, that is to say, in an easterly direction. I\\r\\nwill indicate your line of march as soon as I learn that of the British\\r\\narmy. But make your arrangements now so that your troops shall be ready\\r\\nto march this afternoon and to begin a general movement east of the\\r\\nintrenched camp tomorrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt ten in the morning a consultation was held by Generals Gallieni,\\r\\nClergerie, and Manoury, and the details of the plan of operations were\\r\\nimmediately decided. General Joffre gave permission to attack and\\r\\nannounced that he would himself take the offensive on the 6th. On the\\r\\n5th, at noon, the army from Paris fired the first shot; the battle of\\r\\nthe Ourcq, a preface to the Marne, had begun.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Clergerie then told what a precious purveyor of information he\\r\\nhad found in General von der Marwitz, cavalry commander of the German\\r\\nfirst army, who made intemperate use of the wireless telegraph and did\\r\\nnot even take the trouble to put into cipher his dispatches, of which\\r\\nthe Eiffel Tower made a careful collection. \"In the evening of September\\r\\n9th,\" he said, \"an officer of the intelligence corps brought me a\\r\\ndispatch from this same Marwitz couched in something like these terms:\\r\\n\\'Tell me exactly where you are and what you are doing. Hurry up, because\\r\\nXXX.\\' The officer was greatly embarrassed to interpret those three X\\'s.\\r\\nAdopting the language of the poilu, I said to him, \\'Translate it, \"I am\\r\\ngoing to bolt.\"\\' True enough, next day we found on the site of the\\r\\nGerman batteries, which had been precipitately evacuated, stacks of\\r\\nmunitions; while by the roadside we came upon motors abandoned for the\\r\\nslightest breakdown, and near Betz almost the entire outfit of a field\\r\\nbakery, with a great store of flour and dough half-kneaded. Paris and\\r\\nFrance were saved.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Von Kluck could not get over his astonishment. He has tried to explain\\r\\nit by saying he was unlucky, for out of a hundred governors not one\\r\\nwould have acted as Gallieni did, throwing his whole available force\\r\\nnearly forty miles from his stronghold. It was downright imprudence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VIII\\r\\n\\r\\nJAPAN IN THE WAR\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 15, 1914, the Empire of Japan issued an ultimatum to Germany.\\r\\nShe demanded the evacuation of Tsing-tau, the disarming of the warships\\r\\nthere and the handing over of the territory to Japan for ultimate\\r\\nreversion to China. The time limit for her reply was set at 12 o\\'clock,\\r\\nAugust 24th. To this ultimatum Germany made no reply, and at 2.30 P. M.,\\r\\nAugust 23d, the German Ambassador was handed his passports and war was\\r\\ndeclared.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason for the action of Japan was simple. She was bound by treaty\\r\\nto Great Britain to come to her aid in any war in which Great Britain\\r\\nmight be involved. On August 4th a note was received from Great Britain\\r\\nrequesting Japan to safeguard British shipping in the Far East. Japan\\r\\nreplied that she could not guarantee the safety of British shipping so\\r\\nlong as Germany was in occupation of the Chinese province of Tsing-tau.\\r\\nShe suggested in turn that England agree to allow her to remove this\\r\\nGerman menace. The British Government agreed, on the condition that\\r\\nTsing-tau be subsequently returned to China.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Japanese Government in taking this stand was acting with courage and\\r\\nwith loyalty. Toward individual Germans she entertained no animosity.\\r\\nShe had the highest respect for German scholarship and German military\\r\\nscience. She had been sending her young men to German seats of learning,\\r\\nand had based the reorganization of her army upon the German military\\r\\nsystem. But she did not believe that a treaty was a mere \"scrap of\\r\\npaper,\" and was determined to fulfill her obligations in the treaty with\\r\\nEngland.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems to have been the opinion of the highest Japanese military\\r\\nauthorities that Germany would win the war. Japan\\'s statesmen, however,\\r\\nbelieved that Germany was a menace to both China and Japan and had\\r\\nlively recollections of her unfriendly attitude in connection with the\\r\\nChino-Japanese war and in the period that followed. Germany had been\\r\\nplaying the same game in China that she had played in the Mediterranean\\r\\nand which had ultimately brought about the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chino-Japanese war had been a great Japanese triumph. One of Japan\\'s\\r\\ngreatest victories had been the capture of Port Arthur, but the joy\\r\\ncaused in Japan had not ended before it was turned into mourning because\\r\\nof German interference. Germany had then compelled Japan to quit Port\\r\\nArthur, and to hand over that great fort to Russia so that she herself\\r\\nmight take Kiao-chau without Russia\\'s objection.\\r\\n\\r\\nJapan had never forgotten or forgiven. The German seizure of Kiao-chau\\r\\nhad led to the Russian occupation of Port Arthur, the British occupation\\r\\nof Wei-hai-wei and French occupation of Kwan-chow Bay. The vultures were\\r\\nswooping down on defenseless China. This had led to the Boxer\\r\\ndisturbance of 1910, where again the Kaiser had interfered.\\r\\n\\r\\nJapan, who recognized that her interests and safety were closely allied\\r\\nwith the preservation of the territorial integrity of China, had\\r\\nproposed to the powers that she be permitted to send her troops to the\\r\\nrescue of the beleaguered foreigners, but this proposition was refused\\r\\non account of German suspicion of Japan\\'s motives. Later on, during the\\r\\nRusso-Japanese war, Russia was assisted in many ways by the German\\r\\nGovernment.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, the popular sympathy with the Japanese was strongly with\\r\\nthe Allies. It was the Kaiser who started the cry of the \"yellow peril,\"\\r\\nwhich had deeply hurt Japanese pride. Yet, even with this strong\\r\\nfeeling, it was remarkable that Japan was willing to ally herself with\\r\\nRussia. She knew very well that after all the greatest danger to her\\r\\nliberties lay across the Japan Sea. Russian autocracy, with its\\r\\nmilitarism, its religious intolerance, its discriminating policy against\\r\\nforeign interests in commerce and trade, was the natural opponent of\\r\\nliberal Japan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe immediate object of Japan in joining hands with England was to\\r\\ndestroy the German menace in the Pacific. Before she delivered her\\r\\nultimatum the Germans had been active; ignoring the rights of Japan\\r\\nwhile she was still neutral they had captured a Russian steamer within\\r\\nJapanese jurisdiction, as well as a number of British merchant vessels,\\r\\nand even a few Japanese ships had been intercepted by German cruisers.\\r\\nThis was the disturbance to general peace in the Far East, which had\\r\\nprompted England to request Japan\\'s assistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nJapan, when she entered the war, was at least twice as strong as when\\r\\nshe began the war with Russia. She had an army of one million men, and a\\r\\nnavy double the size of that which she had possessed when the Treaty of\\r\\nPortsmouth was signed. As soon as war was declared she proceeded to act.\\r\\nA portion of her fleet was directed against the German forces in the\\r\\nPacific, one squadron occupying Jaluit, the seat of government of the\\r\\nMarshall Islands, on October 3d, but her main forces were directed\\r\\nagainst the fortress of Tsing-tau.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Germans had taken great pride in Tsing-tau, and had made every\\r\\neffort to make it a model colony as well as an impregnable fortress.\\r\\nThey had built costly water works, fine streets and fine public\\r\\nbuildings. They had been making great preparations for a state of siege,\\r\\nalthough it was not expected that they would be able to hold out for a\\r\\nlong time. There were hardly more than five thousand soldiers in the\\r\\nfortress, and in the harbor but four small gunboats and an Austrian\\r\\ncruiser, the Kaiserin Elizabeth. As Austria was not at war with Japan\\r\\nthe authorization of Japan was asked for the removal of the Kaiserin\\r\\nElizabeth to Shanghai, where she could be interned. The Japanese were\\r\\nfavorable to this proposition, but at the last moment instructions\\r\\narrived from Vienna directing the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador to ask for\\r\\nhis passports at Tokio and the commander of the Kaiserin Elizabeth to\\r\\nassist the Germans in the defense of Tsing-tau. The Germans also\\r\\nreceived orders to defend their fortress to the very last. A portion of\\r\\nthe German squadron, under Admiral von Spee, had sailed away before the\\r\\nJapanese attack, one of these being the famous commerce raider, the\\r\\nEmden.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 27th of August the Japanese made their first move by taking\\r\\npossession of some of the small islands at the mouth of the harbor of\\r\\nKiao-chau. From these points as bases they swept the surrounding waters\\r\\nfor mines, with such success that during the whole siege but one vessel\\r\\nof their fleet was injured by a mine. On the 2d of September they landed\\r\\ntroops at the northern base of the peninsula upon which Tsing-tau was\\r\\nsituated, with the object of cutting off the fortress from the mainland.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe heavy rains which were customary at that season prevented much\\r\\naction, but airplanes were sent which dropped bombs upon the wireless\\r\\nstation, electric power station and railway station of Kiao-chau, and\\r\\nupon the ships in the harbor. On September 13th General Kamio captured\\r\\nthe railway station of Kiao-chau which stands at the head of the bay.\\r\\nThis placed him twenty-two miles from Tsing-tau itself. On September\\r\\n27th he captured Prince Heinrich Hill giving him a gun position from\\r\\nwhich he could attack the inner forts. On the 23d a small British force\\r\\narrived from Wei-hai-wei to co-operate with the Japanese.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map of the city Tsing-Tau and Kiao-Chau Bay.]\\r\\n  THE GERMAN GIBRALTAR IN THE FAR EAST WHICH FELL TO THE JAPANESE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe combined forces then advanced until they were only five miles from\\r\\nTsing-tau. The German warships were bombarding the Japanese troops\\r\\nfiercely, and were being replied to by the Japanese squadron in the\\r\\nmouth of the harbor. The great waste of German ammunition led General\\r\\nKamio to the opinion that the Germans did not contemplate a long siege.\\r\\nHe then determined on a vigorous assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the attack was made he gave the non-combatants an opportunity of\\r\\nleaving, and on the 15th of October a number of women and children and\\r\\nChinese were allowed to pass through the Japanese lines. On October 31st\\r\\nthe bombardment began, and the German forts were gradually silenced. On\\r\\nNovember 2d the Kaiserin Elizabeth was sunk in the harbor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Allied armies were pushing their way steadily down, until, on\\r\\nNovember 6th, their trenches were along the edge of the last German\\r\\nredoubts. At 6 o\\'clock on that day white flags were floating over the\\r\\ncentral forts and by 7.30 Admiral Waldeck, the German Governor, had\\r\\nsigned the terms of capitulation.\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany\\'s prize colony on the continent of Asia had disappeared. The\\r\\nsurvivors, numbering about three thousand, were sent to Japan as\\r\\nprisoners of war. Japanese losses were but two hundred and thirty-six\\r\\nmen killed. They had, however, lost one third-class cruiser, the\\r\\nTakachiho, and several smaller crafts. The whole expedition was a\\r\\nnotable success. It had occupied much less time than either Japan or\\r\\nGermany had expected, and the news was received in Germany with a\\r\\nuniversal feeling of bitterness and chagrin.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Japanese capture of Kiao-chau Japan\\'s assistance to the\\r\\nAllies, while not spectacular, was extremely important, and its\\r\\nimportance increased during the last two years of the war. Her cruiser\\r\\nsquadrons did continuous patrol duty in the Pacific and in the China Sea\\r\\nand even in the Indian Ocean. She occupied three groups of German\\r\\nIslands in the South Sea, assisted in driving German raiders from the\\r\\nPacific, and by her efficiency permitted a withdrawal of British\\r\\nwarships to points where they could be useful nearer home. She patrolled\\r\\nthe Pacific coast of North and South America, landed marines to quell\\r\\nriots at Singapore, and finally entered into active service in European\\r\\nwaters by sending a destroyer squadron to the assistance of the Allies\\r\\nin the Mediterranean.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut while the aid of Japan\\'s navy was important to the Allies, her\\r\\ngreatest assistance to the Allied cause was what she did in supplying\\r\\nRussia with military supplies. The tremendous struggle carried on by\\r\\nRussia\\'s forces during the first years prevented an easy German victory,\\r\\nand was only made possible through the assistance of Japan. Enormous\\r\\nquantities of guns, ammunition, military stores, hospital and Red Cross\\r\\nsupplies, were sent into Russia, with skilled officers and experts to\\r\\naccompany them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the last year of the war Japan once more came prominently in the\\r\\npublic eye in connection with the effort made by the Allies to protect\\r\\nfrom the Russian Bolsheviki vast stores of ammunition which had been\\r\\nlanded in ports of Eastern Siberia. She was compelled to land troops to\\r\\ndo this and to preserve order in localities where her citizens were in\\r\\ndanger. Upon the development of the Czecho-Slovak movement in Eastern\\r\\nSiberia a Japanese force, in association with troops from the United\\r\\nStates and Great Britain, was landed to protect the Czecho-Slovaks from\\r\\nBolsheviki treachery. These troops succeeded in their object, and\\r\\nthroughout the latter period of the war kept Eastern Siberia friendly to\\r\\nthe Allied cause. In this campaign there was but little blood shed. The\\r\\nexpedition was followed by the strong sympathy of the allied world which\\r\\nwas full of admiration for the loyalty and courage of the Czecho-Slovaks\\r\\nand their heroic leaders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IX\\r\\n\\r\\nCAMPAIGN IN THE EAST\\r\\n\\r\\nLong before the declaration of war the German military experts had made\\r\\ntheir plans. They recognized that in case of war with Russia, France\\r\\nwould come to the rescue of its ally. They hoped that Italy, and felt\\r\\nsure that England, would remain neutral, but, no doubt, had provided for\\r\\nthe possibility that these two nations would join the ranks of their\\r\\nfoes. They recognized that they would be compelled to fight against\\r\\ngreatly superior numbers, but they had this advantage, that they were\\r\\nprepared to move at once, while England was unprepared, and Russia, with\\r\\nenormous numbers, was so unprovided with railroad facilities that it\\r\\nwould take weeks before her armies would be dangerous.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir plan of campaign, then, was obvious. Leaving in the east only such\\r\\nforces as were necessary for a strong defense, they would throw the bulk\\r\\nof their strength against the French. They anticipated an easy march to\\r\\nParis, and then with France at their mercy they would gather together\\r\\nall their powers and deal with Russia. But they had underestimated both\\r\\nthe French power of resistance, and the Russian weakness, and in\\r\\nparticular they had not counted upon the check that they were to meet\\r\\nwith in gallant Belgium.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russian mobilization was quicker by far than had been anticipated.\\r\\nHer armies were soon engaged with the comparatively small German forces,\\r\\nand met with great success.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo understand the Russian campaign one must have some knowledge of the\\r\\ngeography of western Russia. Russian Poland projects as a great\\r\\nquadrilateral into eastern Germany. It is bounded on the north by East\\r\\nPrussia, on the south by Galicia, and the western part reaches deep into\\r\\nGermany itself. The land is a broad, level plain, through which from\\r\\nsouth to north runs the River Vistula. In the center lies the capital,\\r\\nWarsaw, protected by a group of fortresses. The Russian army, therefore,\\r\\ncould not make a direct western advance until it had protected its\\r\\nflanks by the conquest of East Prussia on the north, and Galicia on the\\r\\nsouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the beginning of the third week in August the first Russian armies\\r\\nwere ready. Her forces were arranged as follows: Facing East Prussia was\\r\\nthe Army of the Niemen, four corps strong; the Army of Poland,\\r\\nconsisting of fifteen army corps, occupied a wide front from Narev on\\r\\nthe north to the Bug Valley; a third army, the Army of Galicia, directed\\r\\nits line of advance southward into the country between Lemberg and the\\r\\nRiver Sareth. The fortresses protecting Warsaw, still further to the\\r\\neast, were well garrisoned, and in front of them to the west were troops\\r\\nintended to delay any German advance from Posen. The Russian\\r\\ncommander-in-chief was the Grand Duke Nicholas, uncle of the late Czar,\\r\\nand one of the most admirable representatives of the Russian at his\\r\\nbest; a splendid soldier, honest, straightforward, and patriotic, he was\\r\\nthe idol of his men. He had with him a brilliant staff, but the strength\\r\\nof his army lay in its experience. They had learned war in the bitter\\r\\nschool of the Manchurian campaign.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German force on the frontier was not less than five hundred thousand\\r\\nmen, and they were arranged for defense. Austria, in Galicia, had\\r\\ngathered nearly one million men under the auspices of Frederick. The\\r\\nfirst movement of these armies took place in East Prussia. The Army of\\r\\nthe Niemen had completed its mobilization early in August, and was under\\r\\nthe command of General Rennenkampf, one of the Russian leaders in\\r\\nManchuria. In command of the German forces was General von Francois, an\\r\\nofficer of Huguenot descent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first clash of these armies took place on the German frontier near\\r\\nLibau, on August 3d. Two days later, the Russians crossed the frontier,\\r\\ndrove in the German advance posts, and seized the railway which runs\\r\\nsouth and east of the Masurian Lakes. The German force fell back,\\r\\nburning villages and destroying roads, according to their usual plan. On\\r\\nthe 7th of August the main army of Rennenkampf crossed the border at\\r\\nSuwalki, advancing in two main bodies: the Army of the Niemen moving\\r\\nnorth from Suwalki, the Army of the Narev marching through the region of\\r\\nthe Masurian Lakes. In the lake district they advanced toward Boyen, and\\r\\nthen directed their march toward Insterburg.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo protect Insterburg, General van Francois made his first stand at\\r\\nGumbinnen, where, on the 16th of August, the first important battle of\\r\\nthis campaign took place. The result was the defeat and retirement of\\r\\nthe Germans, and von Francois was forced to fall back on Koenigsberg.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime, the Army of the Narev, under General Samsonov, was advancing\\r\\nthrough the country west of the Masurian Lakes. On the 20th his vanguard\\r\\ncame upon a German army corps, strongly entrenched at the northwest end\\r\\nof the lakes. The Germans were defeated, and fled in great disorder\\r\\ntoward Koenigsberg, abandoning their guns and wagons. Many prisoners\\r\\nwere taken, and the Russians found themselves masters of all of East\\r\\nPrussia except that inside the Koenigsberg line. They then marched on\\r\\nKoenigsberg, and East Prussia was for a moment at the mercy of the\\r\\nconqueror.\\r\\n\\r\\nTroops were left to invest Koenigsberg, and East Prussia was overrun\\r\\nwith the enemy. The report as to the behavior of these troops met with\\r\\ngreat indignation in Germany; but better information insists that they\\r\\nbehaved with decorum and discretion. The peasantry of East Prussia,\\r\\nremembering wild tales of the Cossacks of a hundred years before, fled\\r\\nin confusion with stories of burning and slaughter and outrage.\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany became aroused. To thoroughly understand the effect of the\\r\\nRussian invasion of East Prussia, one must know something of the\\r\\nrelations of that district with the German Empire. Historically, this\\r\\nwas the cradle of the Prussian aristocracy, whose dangerous policies had\\r\\nalarmed Europe for so many decades. The Prussian aristocracy originated\\r\\nin a mixture of certain west German and Christian knights, with a pagan\\r\\npopulation of the eastern Baltic plain. The district was separate from\\r\\nPoland and never fell under the Polish influence. It was held by the\\r\\nTeutonic knights who conquered it in a sort of savage independence. The\\r\\nChristian faith, which the Teutonic knights professed to inculcate, took\\r\\nlittle root, but such civilization as Germany itself had absorbed did\\r\\nfilter in. The chief noble of Borussia, the governing Duke, acquired in\\r\\ntime the title of King, and it was here, not in Berlin, nor in\\r\\nBrandenburg, that the Hohenzollern power originated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Painting]\\r\\n  THE FURY OF A COSSACK CHARGE\\r\\n  Some of the most bitter fighting of the war took place on the\\r\\n  snow-covered heights of the Carpathians when Russia\\'s armies struggled\\r\\n  with the foe. Here is illustrated a charge by Cossacks on an Austrian\\r\\n  battery. There is nothing in warfare quite like the furious onslaught\\r\\n  of the little men of the steppes on their wiry ponies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Painting]\\r\\n  HIDE AND SEEK IN THE BALTIC\\r\\n  A Zeppelin flying over a British submarine in the stormy sea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map bounded by Koenigsberg on the North, Warsaw on the East,\\r\\nCracow on the South and Posen on the West.]\\r\\n  THE EASTERN FIGHTING ZONE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEast Prussia, therefore, had a sentimental importance in the eyes of the\\r\\nPrussian nobility. The Prussian Royal House, in particular, had toward\\r\\nthis country an especial regard. Moreover, it was regarded by the\\r\\nGermans as a whole as their rampart against the Slav, a proof of the\\r\\nGerman power to withstand the dreaded Russian. That this sacred soil\\r\\nshould now be in the hands of a Cossack army was not to be borne. The\\r\\nKaiser acted at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nLarge forces were detached from the west and sent to the aid of the\\r\\neastern army. A new commander was appointed. He was General von\\r\\nHindenburg, a veteran of the Franco-Prussian War who had been for some\\r\\nyears retired. After his retirement he devoted his time to the study of\\r\\nEast Prussia, especially the ground around the Masurian Lakes. He became\\r\\nmore familiar with its roads, its fields, its marshes, its bogs than any\\r\\nof the peasants who spent their lives in the neighborhood of the lakes.\\r\\nBefore his retirement, in the annual maneuvers, he had often rehearsed\\r\\nhis defense against Russian invaders. Indeed report, perhaps unfounded,\\r\\ndescribed his retirement to the displeasure of the Emperor William at\\r\\nbeing badly worsted in one of these mimic combats. He had prevented the\\r\\ncountry from being cleared and the swamps from being drained, arguing\\r\\nthat they were worth more to Germany than a dozen fortresses. A man of\\r\\nrugged strength, his face suggesting power and tenacity, he was to\\r\\nbecome the idol of the German people.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis chance had come. His army consisted of remnants of the forces of von\\r\\nFrancois and large reinforcements sent him from the west. In all,\\r\\nperhaps, he had with him 150,000 men, and he had behind him an admirable\\r\\nsystem of strategic railways.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russian High Command was full of confidence. Rennenkampf had\\r\\nadvanced with the Army of the Niemen toward Koenigsberg, whose fall was\\r\\nreported from time to time, without foundation. Koenigsberg was in fact\\r\\nimpregnable to armies no stronger than those under Rennenkampf\\'s\\r\\ncommand. Samsonov with the Army of the Narev, had pushed on to the\\r\\nnortheastern point of the lakes, and defeated the German army corps at\\r\\nFrankenau. Misled by his success, he decided to continue his advance\\r\\nthrough the lake region toward Allenstein. He marched first toward\\r\\nOsterode, in the wilderness of forest, lake and marsh, between\\r\\nAllenstein and the Lower Vistula. His force numbered 200,000 men, but\\r\\nthe swamps made it impossible to proceed in mass. His column had to be\\r\\ntemporarily divided, nor was he well informed as to the strength of his\\r\\nenemy. On Wednesday, the 26th of August, his advance guards were\\r\\neverywhere driven in. As he pushed on he discovered the enemy in great\\r\\nnumbers, and late in the day realized that he was facing a great army.\\r\\n\\r\\nVon Hindenburg had taken a position astride the railway from Allenstein\\r\\nto Soldau, and all access to his front was barred by lakes and swamps.\\r\\nHe was safe from frontal attack, and could reinforce each wing at\\r\\npleasure. From his right ran the only two good roads in the region, and\\r\\nat his left was the Osterode railway. On the first day he stood on the\\r\\ndefensive, while the Russians, confident of victory, attacked again and\\r\\nagain. Some ground was won and prisoners captured, and the news of a\\r\\nsecond victory was sent to western Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe battle continued, however, until the last day of August and is known\\r\\nas the battle of Tannenberg, from a village of that name near the\\r\\nmarshes. Having worn down his enemy, von Hindenburg counter-attacked.\\r\\nHis first movement was on his right. This not only deceived Samsonov and\\r\\nled him to reinforce his left, but also enabled von Hindenburg to seize\\r\\nthe only good road that would give the Russian army a chance of retreat.\\r\\nMeanwhile the German general was hurrying masses of troops northeastward\\r\\nto outflank the Russian right. While the Russians were reinforcing one\\r\\nflank, he was concentrating every man he could upon the other. Then his\\r\\nleft swept southward, driving in and enveloping the Russian right, and\\r\\nSamsonov was driven into a country full of swamps and almost without\\r\\nroads.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo thoroughly understand the plight of the Russian army one must have\\r\\nsome idea of the character of the Masurian Lake district. It was\\r\\nprobably molded by the work of ice in the past. Great glaciers, in their\\r\\nprogress toward the sea, have ground out hundreds of hollows, where are\\r\\nfound small pools and considerable lakes. From these glaciers have been\\r\\ndropped patches of clay which hold the waters in wide extents of marsh\\r\\nand bog. The country presents a monotonous picture of low, rounded\\r\\nswells and flats, interspersed with stunted pine and birch woods. The\\r\\nmarshes and the lakes form a labyrinth, difficult to pass even to those\\r\\nfamiliar with the country. The Masurian region is a great trap for any\\r\\ncommander who has not had unlimited acquaintance with the place.\\r\\nCauseways, filled with great care, and railroads permit an orderly\\r\\nadvance, but in a confused retreat disaster at once threatens.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the ground that von Hindenburg knew so well. The Russians\\r\\nresisted desperately, but their position could not be held. Disaster\\r\\nawaited them. They found their guns sinking to the axle-trees in mire.\\r\\nWhole regiments were driven into the lakes and drowned. On the last day\\r\\nof battle, August 31st, Samsonov himself was killed, and his army\\r\\ncompletely destroyed. Fifty thousand prisoners were taken with hundreds\\r\\nof guns and quantities of supplies. Von Hindenburg had attained the\\r\\ntriumph of which he had so long dreamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was an immensely successful example of that enveloping movement\\r\\ncharacteristic of German warfare, a victory recalling the battle of\\r\\nSedan, and it was upon a scale not inferior to that battle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe news of this great triumph reached Berlin upon the anniversary of\\r\\nthe battle of Sedan, and on the same day that the news came from the\\r\\nwest that von Kluck had reached the gates of Paris and it had a profound\\r\\neffect upon the German mind. They had grown to believe that the Germans\\r\\nwere a sort of superman; these wonderful successes confirmed them in\\r\\nthis belief.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo longer did they talk of a mere defense in the east; an advance on\\r\\nWarsaw was demanded and von Hindenburg was acclaimed the greatest\\r\\nsoldier of his day. The Emperor made him Field Marshal, and placed him\\r\\nin command of the Teutonic armies in the east.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut von Hindenburg was not satisfied. The remnant of the defeated army\\r\\nhad fled toward Narev, and without losing a moment von Hindenburg set\\r\\noff in pursuit. Rennenkampf, all this time, strange to say, had made no\\r\\nmove, and at the news of Samsonov\\'s disaster he abandoned the siege of\\r\\nKoenigsberg and retreated toward the Niemen. At Gumbinnen he fought a\\r\\nrear-guard action with the German left, but had made up his mind that\\r\\nthe Niemen must be the Russian line of defense. Von Hindenburg,\\r\\nfollowing, crossed the Russian frontier and in the wide forests near\\r\\nAugustovo there was much fighting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photographs]\\r\\n  LEADING GERMAN GENERALS\\r\\n  Von Hindenburg, Chief of the German General Staff; von Ludendorff,\\r\\n  Strategist of the General Staff; von Moltke, dismissed by the Kaiser\\r\\n  for incompetency; von Mackensen, Commander in the East; Crown Prince\\r\\n  Rupprecht of Bavaria, Army Commander in the West.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph]\\r\\n  Photo by Press Illustrated Service.\\r\\n  THE GERMAN GENERAL STAFF\\r\\n  von Mackensen, von Moltke, Crown Prince Wilhelm, von Francois,\\r\\n  von Falkenhayn, von Beseler, von Bethmann-Hollweg, von Bulow,\\r\\n  Duke Albrecht, Ludendorf, von Einem, von Hindenburg, von Heeringen,\\r\\n  Crown Prince Rupprecht, von Kluck, von Haeseler, von Tirpitz,\\r\\n  Kaiser Wilhelm II, von Emmich\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis action, described as the first battle of Augustovo, was only a\\r\\nrear-guard action, the Russians desiring merely to delay the enemy for a\\r\\nday or two. German reports, however, described it as a victory only\\r\\nsecond in importance to Tannenberg. Von Hindenburg then occupied\\r\\nSuwalki. He apparently had become over confident, and hardly realized\\r\\nthat Rennenkampf was continually being reinforced by the Russian\\r\\nmobilization.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russian High Command understood the situation very well. Their aim\\r\\nwas to keep von Hindenburg busy on the Niemen, while their armies in the\\r\\nsouth were overwhelming the fleeing Austrians. Von Hindenburg was\\r\\ndeceived, and continued his advance until he got into serious trouble.\\r\\nHis movement had begun on September 7th; his army consisted of the four\\r\\ncorps with which he had won Tannenberg, and large reinforcements from\\r\\nGermany, including at least one guards battalion, and a number of Saxons\\r\\nand Bavarians. The country is one vast mixture of marsh and lake and\\r\\nbog. The roads are few, and advance must therefore be slow and\\r\\ndifficult. Rennenkampf made no attempt to delay him beyond a little\\r\\nrear-guard fighting. The German army reached the Niemen on September\\r\\n21st, and found behind it the Russian army in prepared positions, with\\r\\nlarge reinforcements from Vilna.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe river at this point was wide and deep, and hard to cross. The battle\\r\\nof the Niemen Crossings was an artillery duel. The Russians quietly\\r\\nwaited in their trenches to watch the Germans build their pontoon\\r\\nbridges. Then their guns blew the bridges to pieces. Thereupon von\\r\\nHindenburg bombarded the Russian lines hoping to destroy the Russian\\r\\nguns. On Friday, the 26th, his guns boomed all day; the Russians made no\\r\\nreply. So on the morning of the 27th he built bridges again, and again\\r\\nthe Russians blew them to pieces. On the 28th he gave the order for\\r\\nretreat.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe realized that the game wasn\\'t worth the candle; he might easily be\\r\\nkept fighting on the Niemen for months, while the main armies of the\\r\\nRussians were crossing Austria. Von Hindenburg conducted the retreat\\r\\nwith a skill which came to him naturally from his knowledge of the\\r\\nmarshes.\\r\\n\\r\\nRennenkampf followed him closely, keeping up persistent attacks through\\r\\nthe woods and marshes. The path of the retreating army lay through the\\r\\nforest of Augustovo, a country much like that around the Masurian Lakes,\\r\\nand there the Germans suffered heavy losses. Von Hindenburg managed,\\r\\nhowever, to get the bulk of his forces back across the frontier and\\r\\ncontinued his retreat to the intrenchments on the Masurian Lakes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Germans lost 60,000 men in killed, wounded and prisoners, and von\\r\\nHindenburg handed over the command of the German armies in East Prussia\\r\\nto General von Schubert, and hastened south to direct the movement to\\r\\nrelieve the Austrians at Cracow.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut quite as important as the campaign in East Prussia was the struggle\\r\\nin Galicia. When the war began the Germans contemplated merely defense\\r\\nin their own domain; such offense as was planned was left to the\\r\\nAustrians farther south.\\r\\n\\r\\nGalicia is a long, level country lying north of the Carpathian\\r\\nMountains, and in this country Austria-Hungary had gathered together a\\r\\nforce of hardly less than one million men. A quarter of these lay in\\r\\nreserve near the mountains; the remaining three-quarters was divided\\r\\ninto two armies; the first, the northern army, being under the command\\r\\nof General Dankl, the second was that of von Offenberg. The base of the\\r\\nfirst army was Przemysl; that of the second was Lemberg.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first army, it was planned, was to advance into Russian territory in\\r\\nthe direction of Lublin. The second army, stationed southeast of the\\r\\nfirst army, was to protect it from any Russians who might strike in upon\\r\\nthe south. The first army, therefore, contained more picked material\\r\\nthan the second, which included many troops from the southern parts of\\r\\nthe empire, including certain disaffected contingents. The first army\\r\\nmade its advance as soon as possible, and entered Russian territory on\\r\\nthe 11th of August. It went forward with very little loss and against\\r\\nvery little resistance. The Russian forces which were against it were\\r\\ninferior in number, and fell back towards the Bug. The Austrians\\r\\nfollowed, turning somewhat toward the east, when their advance was\\r\\nchecked by news of catastrophe in their rear. On the 14th of August the\\r\\nRussian army under General Ruzsky crossed the frontier, and advanced\\r\\ntoward the Austrian second army.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russian army was in far greater strength than had been expected, and\\r\\nwhen its advance was followed by the appearance upon the right flank of\\r\\nvon Offenberg\\'s command, of yet another Russian army, under Brussilov,\\r\\nthe Austrian second army found itself in great danger. Ruzsky advanced\\r\\nsteadily from August 14th until, on the 21st, it was not more than one\\r\\nday\\'s advance from the outer works of Lemberg, and the third Russian\\r\\narmy under Brussilov was threatening von Offenberg\\'s right flank.\\r\\n\\r\\nVon Offenberg, underestimating the strength of the enemy, undertook to\\r\\ngive battle. The first outpost actions were successful for the\\r\\nAustrians, and helped them in their blunder. On the 24th of August the\\r\\ntwo Russian armies effected a junction, and their Austrian opponents\\r\\nfound themselves threatened with disaster. An endeavor was made to\\r\\nretreat, but the retreat turned into a rout. On the 28th Tarnopol was\\r\\ncaptured by the Russians, and the Austrian army found itself compelled\\r\\nto fall back upon defense positions to the south and east of Lemberg\\r\\nitself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attack of the Russian armies was completely successful. The Austrian\\r\\narmy was driven from its positions, and on September 4th the Austrians\\r\\nevacuated Lemberg and the Russian forces took possession of the town.\\r\\nThe Austrians fled. The population welcomed the conquerors with the\\r\\ngreatest enthusiasm. An immense quantity of stores of every kind were\\r\\ncaptured by the Russians together with at least 100,000 prisoners. There\\r\\nwas no looting, nor any kind of outrage. The Russian policy was to make\\r\\nfriends of the inhabitants of Galicia.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there was no halt after Lemberg. Brussilov divided his army, and\\r\\nsent his left wing into the Carpathian passes; his center and right\\r\\nmoved west toward Przemysl; while Ruzsky moved northwest to reinforce\\r\\nthe Russian army on the Bug. Meanwhile the position of Dankl\\'s army was\\r\\nperilous in the extreme. There were two possible courses, one to fall\\r\\nback and join the remnants of von Offenberg\\'s army, the other to attack\\r\\nat once, before the first Russian army could be reinforced, and if\\r\\nvictorious to turn on Ruzsky.\\r\\n\\r\\nDankl\\'s army was now very strong. He had received reinforcements, not\\r\\nonly from Austria but from Germany. On the 4th of September he attacked\\r\\nthe Russian center; his attack was a failure, although he outnumbered\\r\\nthe Russians. The battle continued until the tenth.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverywhere the Austrians were beaten, and driven off in ignominious\\r\\nretreat. The whole Austrian force fled southward in great disorder; a\\r\\npart directed its flight toward Przemysl, others still farther west\\r\\ntoward Cracow. Austria had been completely defeated. Poland was clear of\\r\\nthe enemy. The Russian flag flew over Lemberg, while the Russian army\\r\\nwas marching toward Cracow. The Russian star was in the ascendant.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Austrian armies had not been annihilated. An army of nearly a\\r\\nmillion men cannot be destroyed in so short a time. The Austrian failure\\r\\nwas due in part to the disaffection of some of the elements of the army,\\r\\nand in part to the poor Austrian generalship. They had underestimated\\r\\ntheir foe, and ventured on a most perilous plan of campaign.\\r\\n\\r\\nRussian generalship had been most admirable, and the Russian generals\\r\\nwere men of ability and experience. Brussilov had seen service in the\\r\\nTurkish War of 1877. Ruzsky was a professor in the Russian War Academy.\\r\\nIn the Japanese war he had been chief of staff to General Kaulbars, the\\r\\ncommander of the Second Manchurian army. Associated with him was General\\r\\nRadko Dmitrieff, an able officer with a most interesting career. General\\r\\nDmitrieff was born in Bulgaria, when it was a Turkish province. He\\r\\ngraduated at the Military School at Sofia, and afterwards at the War\\r\\nAcademy at Petrograd. On his return to Bulgaria he commanded a regiment\\r\\nin the Serbian-Bulgarian war. Later he became mixed up in the conspiracy\\r\\nagainst Prince Alexander, and was forced to leave Bulgaria. For ten\\r\\nyears he served in the Russian army, returning to Bulgaria on the\\r\\naccession of Prince Ferdinand. Later on he became Chief of the General\\r\\nStaff, and when the Balkan war broke out he commanded one of the\\r\\nBulgarian armies, won several important victories, and became a popular\\r\\nhero of the war. Disgusted with the political squabbles which followed\\r\\nthe war, he returned to Russia as a general in the Russian army. With\\r\\nmen like these in command, the Russian Empire was well served.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the decisive defeat of the Austrian army under General Dankl,\\r\\ncertain changes were made in the Russian High Command. General Ruzsky\\r\\nwas made commander of the center, which was largely reinforced. General\\r\\nIvanov was put in command of the armies operating in Galicia with\\r\\nDmitrieff and Brussilov as his chief lieutenants. Brussilov\\'s business\\r\\nwas to seize the deep passes in the Carpathians and to threaten Hungary.\\r\\nDmitrieff\\'s duty was to press the Austrian retreat, and capture the main\\r\\nfortresses of central Galicia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two great fortresses on the River San, Jaroslav and Przemysl,\\r\\nboth of them controlling important railroad routes. Jaroslav on the main\\r\\nline from Lemberg to Cracow, Przemysl with a line which skirts the\\r\\nCarpathians, and connects with lines going south to Hungary. Jaroslav\\r\\nwas fortified by a strong circle of intrenchments and was looked to by\\r\\nAustria for stout resistance. The Austrians were disappointed, for\\r\\nIvanov captured it in three days, on the 23d of September. Dmitrieff\\r\\nfound Przemysl a harder nut to crack. It held out for many months, while\\r\\noperations of greater importance were being carried on by the Russian\\r\\narmies. The plans of the Russian generals in some respects were not\\r\\nunlike the plan previously suggested as that of the German High Command.\\r\\nAt the beginning of the war they had no desire to carry on a powerful\\r\\noffensive against Germany. The expedition into East Prussia was\\r\\nconducted more for political than for military purposes. The real\\r\\noffensive at the start was to be against Austria. The Russian movements\\r\\nwere cautious at first, but the easy capture of Lemberg, the fall of\\r\\nJaroslav, and the demoralization of the Austrian armies, encouraged more\\r\\ndaring strategy. With the Germans stopped on the north, little aid to\\r\\nthe Austrians could come from that source. The Grand Duke Nicholas was\\r\\neager to strike a great blow before the winter struck in, so his armies\\r\\nswept to the great Polish city of Cracow. The campaign against Austria\\r\\nalso had a political side.\\r\\n\\r\\nRussia had determined upon a new attitude toward Poland. On August 15th\\r\\nthe Grand Duke Nicholas, on behalf of the Czar, had issued a\\r\\nproclamation offering self-government to Russian Poland. Home rule for\\r\\nPoland had long been a favorite plan with the Czar. Now he promised, not\\r\\nonly to give Russian Poland home rule, but to add to it the Polish\\r\\npeoples in Austria and Germany. This meant that Austria and Germany\\r\\nwould have to give up Galicia on the one hand, and Prussian Poland on\\r\\nthe other, if they should lose the war. In the old days Poland had been\\r\\none of the greatest kingdoms in Europe, with a proud nobility and high\\r\\ncivilization. She was one of the first of the great Slav peoples to\\r\\npenetrate the west. Later she had protected Europe against Tartar\\r\\ninvasion, but internal differences had weakened her, and, surrounded by\\r\\nenemies, she had first been plundered, and later on divided between\\r\\nAustria, Russia and Prussia. Never had the Poles consented to this\\r\\ndestruction of their independence. Galicia had constantly struggled\\r\\nagainst Austria; Prussian Poland was equally disturbing to the Prussian\\r\\npeace, and Russia was only able to maintain the control of her Polish\\r\\nprovince by the sword.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the three the Pole was probably more inclined to keep on friendly\\r\\nterms with Russia, also a Slav people. The policy of the Czar encouraged\\r\\nthis inclination and produced disaffection among the Poles in Galicia\\r\\nand in Posen. Moreover, it gave Russia the sympathy of the world which\\r\\nhad long regarded the partition of Poland as a political crime. It\\r\\nencouraged the Czecho-Slavs and other dissatisfied portions of the\\r\\nAustrian Empire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe results were seen immediately in the demoralization of the Austrian\\r\\narmies where considerable numbers of Czecho-Slovak troops deserted to\\r\\nthe Russian army, and later in the loyalty to Russia of the Poles, and\\r\\ntheir refusal, even under the greatest German pressure, to give the\\r\\nGerman Empire aid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER X\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE STRUGGLE FOR SUPREMACY ON THE SEA\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Mahan\\'s thesis that in any great war the nation possessing the\\r\\ngreater sea power is likely to win, was splendidly illustrated during\\r\\nthe World War.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great English fleets proved the insuperable obstacle to the\\r\\nambitious German plans of world dominion. The millions of soldiers\\r\\nlanded in France from Great Britain, and its provinces, the millions of\\r\\nAmericans transported in safety across the water, and the enormous\\r\\nquantities of supplies put at the disposal of the Allies depended,\\r\\nabsolutely, upon the Allied control of the sea routes of the world. With\\r\\na superior navy a German blockade of England would have brought her to\\r\\nterms in a short period, and France, left to fight alone, would have\\r\\nbeen an easy victim. The British navy saved the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany had for many years well understood the necessity of power upon\\r\\nthe sea. When the war broke out it was the second greatest of the sea\\r\\npowers. Its ships were mostly modern, for its navy was a creation of the\\r\\npast fifteen years, and its development was obviously for the purpose of\\r\\nattacking the British supremacy. The father of this new navy was a naval\\r\\nofficer by the name of von Tirpitz, who, in 1897, had become the German\\r\\nNaval Minister. With the aid of the Emperor he had aroused among the\\r\\nGermans a great enthusiasm for maritime power, and had built up a navy\\r\\nin fifteen years, which was second only to the English navy.\\r\\n\\r\\nVon Tirpitz was an interesting character. In appearance he looked like\\r\\nan old sea-wolf who had passed his life on the wave, but such a thought\\r\\nwould be a mistake. The great admiral\\'s work was done on land; he was an\\r\\norganizer, a diplomatist, and a politician. He created nothing new; in\\r\\nall its details he merely copied the English fleet. He is tall, heavily\\r\\nbuilt, with a great white beard, forked in the middle. He is a man of\\r\\nmuch dignity, with a smile which has won him renown. He might have been\\r\\nChancellor of the Empire but he preferred to devote himself to the navy,\\r\\nto prove that the future of Germany is on the seas. His glories are the\\r\\nLusitania, the fleet safely anchored at Kiel, and the long rows of\\r\\ninnocent victims of the submarine.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was born in 1850 at Kustrion on the Ildor, when the German navy was\\r\\nonly a little group of worthless boats. In 1865 he entered the School of\\r\\nCadets, in 1869 he was gazetted lieutenant, in 1875 he was\\r\\nlieutenant-commander with a reputation as an able organizer. In 1891 he\\r\\nwas appointed Chief of Staff at Kiel. This was his opportunity, and he\\r\\nset himself at the task of creating and protecting the submarine\\r\\ndivision of the navy. As time went on he grew in importance. In 1898 he\\r\\nbecame Assistant Secretary of State at the Admiralty in Berlin. Two\\r\\nyears later he became vice-admiral. His admirers recognized his powers,\\r\\nand he was called the master. In 1899 a patent of nobility was conferred\\r\\nupon him. In 1902 he gained permission to build 13,000-ton war ships,\\r\\nand the following year he was made admiral. In 1907 enormous\\r\\nappropriations were made at his desire for the enlargement of the fleet.\\r\\nIn 1908 Emperor William conferred on him the Order of the Black Eagle.\\r\\nIn 1914 the Kiel Canal was completed under his direction, and he\\r\\ninformed the Emperor that the fleet was ready. It is only fair to add\\r\\nthat in all his plans he had the active support of his Imperial Master.\\r\\nThe Kaiser, too, had dreamed a dream. Von Tirpitz admired the English.\\r\\nHis children had been brought up in England, as was also his wife. He\\r\\nimitated the English, but on the day of the declaration of war he\\r\\nabsolutely forbade his family to talk English, and he made a bonfire of\\r\\nhis fine scientific library of English books. The Kaiser treated Von\\r\\nTirpitz as his friend, asked his advice, and followed his counsel. His\\r\\nson, Sub-Lieutenant Wolf Von Tirpitz, studied at Oxford, and is on the\\r\\nmost friendly terms with many English gentlemen of importance. He was on\\r\\nboard the Mainz, which was sunk off Helgoland in August, 1916. In full\\r\\nuniform he swam for twenty minutes, before being picked up by one of the\\r\\nboats of the cruiser Liverpool. He was a lucky prisoner of war. The\\r\\nGerman battleships and cruisers which represent the toil of von Tirpitz\\r\\nfor more than half a century, lay hidden away in the shelter of the Kiel\\r\\nCanal during the war to be ingloriously surrendered at its end. His name\\r\\nwill remain linked with that of the Lusitania.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Painting: Seven sailors firing a large deck gun against\\r\\na sinking ship in the background.]\\r\\n  DRIVING THE GERMAN COMMERCE RAIDERS OFF THE SEAS\\r\\n  The British light cruiser, \"Highflyer,\" sinking the \"Kaiser Wilhelm\\r\\n  der Grosse\" off the West Coast of Africa early in the war. The\\r\\n  commerce-destroyer was attacking a British steamer when the cruiser\\r\\n  came up and sent her to the bottom. Inserts show both ships.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Painting: Torpedo crossing behind the path of a small ship.]\\r\\n  Copyright International Film Service.\\r\\n  ESCAPING A TORPEDO BY RAPID MANEUVERING\\r\\n  This destroyer escaped a torpedo from a hunted submarine by quickly\\r\\n  turning. Generally the torpedo travels at about fifteen feet under\\r\\n  water.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German High Sea Fleet, at the beginning of the war, consisted of\\r\\nforty-one battleships, seven battle cruisers, nine armored cruisers,\\r\\nforty-nine light cruisers, one hundred and forty-five destroyers, eighty\\r\\ntorpedo boats, and thirty-eight submarines. Under the direction of Von\\r\\nTirpitz the navy had become democratic and had drawn to it many able men\\r\\nof the middle class. Its training was highly specialized and the\\r\\nofficers were enthusiasts in their profession. The navy of\\r\\nAustria-Hungary had also expanded in recent years under the inspiration\\r\\nof Admiral Montecuculi. At the outbreak of the war the fleet comprised\\r\\nsixteen battleships, two armored and twelve light cruisers, eighteen\\r\\ndestroyers, eighty-five torpedo boats and eleven submarines. The Allies\\r\\nwere much more powerful. The French navy had in the matter of invention\\r\\ngiven the lead to the world, but its size had not kept pace with its\\r\\nquality. At the beginning of the war France had thirty-one battleships,\\r\\ntwenty-four armored cruisers, eight light cruisers, eighty-seven\\r\\ndestroyers, one hundred and fifty-three torpedo boats and seventy-six\\r\\nsubmarines. Russia, after the war with Japan, had begun the creation of\\r\\na powerful battle fleet, which had not been completed when war was\\r\\ndeclared. At that time she had on the Baltic four dreadnaughts, ten\\r\\narmored cruisers, two light cruisers, eighty destroyers and twenty-four\\r\\nsubmarines, and a fleet of about half the strength in the Black Sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe English fleet had reached a point of efficiency which was\\r\\nunprecedented in its history. The progress of the German sea power had\\r\\nstimulated the spirit of the fleet, and led to a steady advance in\\r\\ntraining and equipment. The development of armament, and of battleship\\r\\ndesigning, the improvement in gunnery practice, the revision of the rate\\r\\nof pay, the opening up of careers from the lower deck, and the provision\\r\\nof a naval air service are landmarks in the advance. In the navy\\r\\nestimates of March, 1914, Parliament sanctioned over 51,000,000 Pounds\\r\\nfor a naval defense, the largest appropriation for the purpose ever\\r\\nmade. The home fleet was arranged in three units, the first fleet was\\r\\ndivided into four battle squadrons, together with the flagship of the\\r\\ncommander-in-chief. The first squadron was made up of eight battleships,\\r\\nthe second squadron contained eight, the third eight and the fourth\\r\\nfour. Attached to each fleet was a battle cruiser squadron, consisting\\r\\nof four ships in the first fleet, four in the second, four in the third\\r\\nand five in the fourth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fourth also contained a light cruiser squadron, a squadron of six\\r\\ngunboats for mine sweeping, and four flotillas of destroyers, each with\\r\\na flotilla cruiser attached. The second fleet was composed of two battle\\r\\nsquadrons, the first containing eight pre-dreadnaughts, and the second\\r\\nsix. Attached to this fleet were also two cruiser squadrons, a mine\\r\\nlayer squadron of seven vessels, four patrol flotillas, consisting of\\r\\ndestroyers and torpedo boats, and seven flotillas of submarines. A third\\r\\nfleet contained two battle squadrons, mainly composed of old ships, with\\r\\nsix cruiser squadrons. The English strength, outside home waters,\\r\\nconsisted of the Mediterranean fleet, containing three battle cruisers,\\r\\nfour armored cruisers, four ordinary cruisers and a flotilla of\\r\\nseventeen destroyers, together with submarines and torpedo boats. In\\r\\neastern waters there were a battleship, two cruisers, and four sloops.\\r\\nIn the China squadron there were one battleship, two armored cruisers,\\r\\ntwo ordinary cruisers, and a number of gunboats, destroyers, submarines,\\r\\nand torpedo boats. In New Zealand there were four cruisers. The\\r\\nAustralian fleet contained a battle cruiser, three ordinary cruisers,\\r\\nthree destroyers and two submarines. Other cruisers and gunboats were\\r\\nstationed at the Cape, the west coast of Africa, and along the western\\r\\nAtlantic. At the outbreak of the war two destroyers were purchased from\\r\\nChile, and two Turkish battleships, building in England, were\\r\\ncommandeered by the government.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is evident that the union of France and Britain made the Allies\\r\\neasily superior in the Mediterranean Sea, so that France was able to\\r\\ntransport her African troops in safety, and the British commerce with\\r\\nIndia and the East could safely continue. The main field of the naval\\r\\nwar, therefore, was the North Sea and the Baltic, where Germany had all\\r\\nher fleet, except a few naval raiders. The entrance to the Baltic was\\r\\nclosed to the enemy by Denmark, which, as a neutral, was bound to\\r\\nprevent an enemy fleet from passing. Germany, however, by means of the\\r\\nKiel Canal, could permit the largest battle fleet to pass from the\\r\\nBaltic to the North Sea. The German High Sea Fleet was weaker than the\\r\\nBritish home fleet by more than forty per cent, and the German policy,\\r\\ntherefore, was to avoid a battle, until, through mine layers and\\r\\nsubmarines, the British power should have been sufficiently weakened.\\r\\nThe form of the German coast made this plan easily possible. The various\\r\\nbays and river mouths provided safe retreat for the German ships, and\\r\\nthe German fleet were made secure by the fortifications along the coast.\\r\\nOn July the 29th, 1914, at the conclusion of the annual maneuvers,\\r\\ninstead of being demobilized as would have been usual, the Grand Fleet\\r\\nof Great Britain sailed from Portland along the coast into the mists,\\r\\nand from that moment dominated the whole course of the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the 4th of August, the date of the declaration of war, the oceans\\r\\nof the world were practically rid of enemy war ships, and were closed to\\r\\nenemy mercantile marine. Although diplomacy had not yet failed, the\\r\\nmasters of the English navy were not caught napping. The credit for this\\r\\nreadiness has been given to Mr. Winston Churchill, one of the first\\r\\nLords of the Admiralty, who had divined the coming danger. When the\\r\\ngrand fleet sailed it seemed to disappear from English view.\\r\\nOccasionally some dweller along the coast might see an occasional\\r\\ncruiser or destroyer sweeping by in the distance, but the great\\r\\nbattleships had gone. Somewhere, in some hidden harbor, lay the vigilant\\r\\nfleets of England.\\r\\n\\r\\nSea fighting had changed since the days of Admiral Nelson. The old\\r\\nwooden ship belonged to a past generation. The guns of a battleship\\r\\nwould have sunk the Spanish Armada with one broadside. In this modern\\r\\nday the battleship was protected by aircraft, which dropped bombs from\\r\\nthe clouds. Unseen submarines circled about her. Beneath her might be\\r\\nmines, which could destroy her at the slightest touch. Everything had\\r\\nchanged but the daring of the English sailor.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn command of the Home fleet was Admiral Sir John Jellicoe. He had had a\\r\\ndistinguished career. Beginning as a lieutenant in the Egyptian War of\\r\\n1882, he had become a commander in 1891. In 1897 he became a captain,\\r\\nand served in China, commanding the Naval Brigade in the Pekin\\r\\nExpedition of 1900, where he was severely wounded. Later he became naval\\r\\nassistant to the Controller of the Navy, Director of Naval Ordnance and\\r\\nTorpedoes, Rear-Admiral in the United Fleet, Lord Commissioner of the\\r\\nAdmiralty and Controller of the Navy, Vice-Admiral commanding the\\r\\nAtlantic fleet, Vice-Admiral commanding the second division of the Home\\r\\nfleet, and second Sea Lord of the Admiralty. He had distinguished\\r\\nhimself in the naval maneuvers of 1913, and was one of the officers\\r\\nmainly responsible for the development of the modern English navy. He\\r\\nhad the confidence of his colleagues, and a peculiar popularity among\\r\\nthe British seamen.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the day after the declaration of war, the first shots were fired.\\r\\nGerman mine layers, it is now believed, in disguise, had been dropping\\r\\nmines during the preceding week over a wide area of the North Sea. On\\r\\nthe 5th of August the mine layer, Koenigen Luise, was sunk by the\\r\\ndestroyer Lance, and on August 6th the British light cruiser Amphion\\r\\nstruck one of the mines laid by the Koenigen Luise and was sunk with\\r\\ngreat loss of life. On August 9th, German submarines attacked a cruiser\\r\\nsquadron without causing any damage, and one submarine was sunk.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was in the Mediterranean, however, that the greatest interest was\\r\\nfelt during the first week of the war. Two German war ships, the Goeben\\r\\nand the Breslau, were off the Algerian coast when war broke out. It is\\r\\nprobable that when these ships received their sailing orders, Germany\\r\\ndepended on the assistance of Italy, and had sent these ships to its\\r\\nassistance. They were admirably suited for commerce destroyers. They\\r\\nbegan by bombarding the Algerian coast towns of Bona and Phillipe, doing\\r\\nlittle damage. They then turned toward the coast of Gibraltar, but found\\r\\nbefore them the British fleet. Eluding the British they next appeared at\\r\\nMessina. There the captains and officers made their wills and deposited\\r\\ntheir valuables, including signed portraits of the Kaiser, with the\\r\\nGerman consul. The decks were cleared for action, and with the bands\\r\\nplaying they sailed out under a blood-red sunset.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, they seem to have been intent only on escape, and they went at\\r\\nfull speed eastward toward the Dardanelles, meeting in their way only\\r\\nwith the British cruiser Gloucester, which, though much inferior in\\r\\nsize, attacked them boldly but was unable to prevent their escape. On\\r\\nentering Constantinople they were reported as being sold to the Turkish\\r\\nGovernment, the Turks thus beginning the line of conduct which was\\r\\nultimately to bring them into the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nPicturesque as this incident was it was of no importance as compared\\r\\nwith the great British blockade of Germany which began on the 4th of\\r\\nAugust. German merchantmen in every country of the empire were seized,\\r\\nand hundreds of ships were captured on the high seas. Those who escaped\\r\\nto neutral ports were at once interned. In a week German commerce had\\r\\nceased to exist. A few German cruisers were still at large but it was\\r\\nnot long before they had been captured, or driven into neutral ports.\\r\\nAmong the most picturesque of these raiders were the Emden and the\\r\\nKoenigsberg. The Emden, in particular, interested the world with her\\r\\nromantic adventures. Her story is best told in the words of\\r\\nLieutenant-Captain von Mucke, and Lieutenant Gyssing, whose return to\\r\\nGermany with forty-four men, four officers and one surgeon, after the\\r\\ndestruction of the ship, was a veritable Odyssey.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Painting]\\r\\n  A BATTLE OF FOUR ELEMENTS\\r\\n  British monitors shelling the German land batteries near Nieuport.\\r\\n  German submarines were actively engaged in trying to torpedo these\\r\\n  monitors and the British monoplane was useful for giving the range to\\r\\n  the ship and reporting the accuracy of the shots.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Painting]\\r\\n  TORPEDOING OF THE BRITISH BATTLESHIP, \"ABOUKIR\"\\r\\n  In the first few weeks of the war, when the navies of the world were\\r\\n  still at open warfare, during a sharp engagement off the Hook of\\r\\n  Holland in the North Sea the British warships \"Aboukir\", \"Cressy\" and\\r\\n  \"Hogue\" fell victims to the enemy. This sketch shows the \"Aboukir\"\\r\\n  after a German torpedo had found its mark in her hull.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We on the Emden had no idea where we were going, as, on August 11,\\r\\n1914, we separated from the cruiser squadron, escorted only by the\\r\\ncoaler Markomannia.

That was a piece of luck, for afterward we needed many\\r\\nofficers for the capturing and sinking of steamers, or manning them when\\r\\nwe took them with us. On September 10th, the first boat came in sight.\\r\\nWe stopped her; she proved to be a Greek tramp returning from England.\\r\\nOn the next day we met the Indus, bound for Bombay, all fitted up as a\\r\\ntroop transport, but still without troops. That was the first one we\\r\\nsunk. The crew we took aboard the Markomannia. Then we sank the Lovat,\\r\\na troop transport ship, and took the Kambinga along with us. One gets\\r\\nused quickly to new forms of activity. After a few days, capturing ships\\r\\nbecame a habit. Of the twenty-three which we captured most of them\\r\\nstopped after our first signal; when they didn\\'t, we fired a blank shot.\\r\\nThen they all stopped. Only one, the Clan Matteson, waited for a real\\r\\nshot across the bow before giving up its many automobiles and\\r\\nlocomotives to the seas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The officers were mostly very polite, and let down rope ladders for us.\\r\\nAfter a few hours they would be on board with us. We ourselves never set\\r\\nfoot in their cabins, nor took charge of them. The officers often acted\\r\\non their own initiative, and signaled to us the nature of their cargo.\\r\\nThen the commandant decided as to whether to sink the ship or take it\\r\\nwith us. Of the cargo we always took every thing we could use,\\r\\nparticularly provisions. Many of the English officers and sailors made\\r\\ngood use of the hours of transfer to drink up the supply of whisky\\r\\ninstead of sacrificing it to the waves. I heard that one captain was\\r\\nlying in tears at the enforced separation from his beloved ship, but on\\r\\ninvestigation found that he was merely dead drunk, The captain on one\\r\\nship once called out cheerily \\'Thank God, I\\'ve been captured.\\' He had\\r\\nreceived expense money for the trip to Australia, and was now saved half\\r\\nthe journey.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nParenthetically it may be remarked, that the Emden\\'s captain, Karl von\\r\\nMueller, conducted himself at all times with chivalrous bravery,\\r\\naccording to the accounts of the English themselves, who in their\\r\\nreports say of him, admiringly, \"He played the game.\" Captain von\\r\\nMucke\\'s account continues:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We had mostly quiet weather, so that communication with captured ships\\r\\nwas easy. They were mostly dynamited, or else shot close to the water\\r\\nline. At Calcutta we made one of our richest hauls, the Diplomat, chock\\r\\nfull of tea, we sunk $2,500,000 worth. On the same day the Trabbotch,\\r\\ntoo, which steered right straight towards us, was captured. By now we\\r\\nwanted to beat it out of the Bay of Bengal, because we had learned from\\r\\nthe papers that the Emden was being keenly searched for. By Rangoon we\\r\\nencountered a Norwegian tramp, which, for a cash consideration, took\\r\\nover all the rest of our prisoners of war.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On September 23d we reached Madras, and steered straight for the\\r\\nharbor. We stopped still 3,000 yards before the city. Then we shot up\\r\\nthe oil tanks; three or four of them burned up and illuminated the city.\\r\\nTwo days later we navigated around Ceylon, and could see the lights of\\r\\nColombo. On the same evening we gathered in two more steamers, the King\\r\\nLund, and Tywerse. The next evening we got the Burresk, a nice steamer\\r\\nwith 500 tons of nice Cardiff coal. Then followed in order, the Ryberia,\\r\\nFoyle, Grand Ponrabbel, Benmore, Troiens, Exfort, Graycefale, Sankt\\r\\nEckbert, Chilkana. Most of them were sunk. The coal ships were kept. All\\r\\nthis happened before October 20th. Then we sailed southward to Deogazia,\\r\\nsouthwest of Colombo.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe captain then tells with much gusto a story of a visit paid to the\\r\\nEmden by some English farmers, at Deogazia, who were entertained royally\\r\\nby the Emden officers. They knew nothing about the war, and the Emden\\r\\nofficers told them nothing. His narrative continues:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now we went toward Miniko, where we sank two ships more. On the next\\r\\nday we found three steamers to the north, one of them with much desired\\r\\nCardiff coal. From English papers on the captured ships we learned that\\r\\nwe were being hotly pursued. One night we started for Penang. On October\\r\\n28th we raised a very practicable fourth smokestack (for disguise). The\\r\\nharbor of Penang lies in a channel difficult of access. There was\\r\\nnothing doing by night. We had to do it at daybreak. At high speed,\\r\\nwithout smoke, with lights out, we steered into the mouth of the\\r\\nchannel. A torpedo boat on guard slept well. We steamed past its small\\r\\nlight. Inside lay a dark silhouette. That must be a warship. We\\r\\nrecognized the silhouette dead sure. That was the Russian cruiser\\r\\nJemtchud. There it lay, there it slept like a rat, no watch to be seen.\\r\\nThey made it easy for us. Because of the narrowness of the harbor we had\\r\\nto keep close; we fired the first torpedo at four hundred yards.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, to be sure, things livened up a bit on the sleeping warship. At\\r\\nthe same time we took the crew quarters under fire five shells at a\\r\\ntime. There was a flash of flame on board, then a kind of burning\\r\\naureole. After the fourth shell the flame burned high. The first torpedo\\r\\nhad struck the ship too deep, because we were too close to it. A second\\r\\ntorpedo which we fired off from the other side didn\\'t make the same\\r\\nmistake. After twenty seconds there was absolutely not a trace of the\\r\\nship to be seen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But now another ship which we couldn\\'t see was firing. That was the\\r\\nFrench D\\'Ivrebreville, toward which we now turned at once. A few minutes\\r\\nlater an incoming torpedo destroyer was reported. It proved to be the\\r\\nFrench torpedo boat Mousquet. It came straight toward us. That\\'s always\\r\\nremained a mystery to me, for it must have heard the shooting. An\\r\\nofficer whom we fished up afterward explained to me that they had only\\r\\nrecognized we were a German warship when they were quite close to us.\\r\\nThe Frenchman behaved well, accepted battle and fought on, but was\\r\\npolished off by us with three broadsides. The whole fight with those\\r\\nships lasted half an hour. The commander of the torpedo boat lost both\\r\\nlegs by the first broadside. When he saw that part of his crew were\\r\\nleaping overboard he cried out \\'Tie me fast. I will not survive after\\r\\nseeing Frenchmen desert their ship.\\' As a matter of fact he went down\\r\\nwith his ship, as a brave captain, lashed fast to the mast. That was my\\r\\nonly sea-fight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On November 9th I left the Emden in order to destroy the wireless plant\\r\\non the Cocos Island. I had fifty men, four machine guns and about thirty\\r\\nrifles. Just as we were about to destroy the apparatus it reported\\r\\n\\'Careful. Emden near.\\' The work of destruction went smoothly. Presently\\r\\nthe Emden signaled to us \\'Hurry up.\\' I pack up, but simultaneously wails\\r\\nthe Emden\\'s siren. I hurry up to the bridge, see the flag \\'Anna\\' go up.\\r\\nThat means weigh anchor. We ran like mad into our boat, but already the\\r\\nEmden\\'s pennant goes up, the battle flag is raised, they fire from\\r\\nstarboard. The enemy is concealed by the island, and therefore not to be\\r\\nseen, but I see the shell strike the water. To follow and catch the\\r\\nEmden is out of question. She is going twenty knots, I only four with my\\r\\nsteam pinnace. Therefore I turn back to land, raise the flag, declare\\r\\nGerman laws of war in force, seize all arms, set out my machine guns on\\r\\nshore in order to guard against a hostile landing. Then I run again in\\r\\norder to observe the fight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cable operator at Cocos Island gives the following account of what\\r\\nhappened from this point. After describing the sudden flight of the\\r\\nEmden, he goes on: \"Looking to the eastward we could see the reason for\\r\\nthis sudden departure, for a warship, which we afterwards learned was\\r\\nthe Australian cruiser Sydney, was coming up at full speed in pursuit.\\r\\nThe Emden did not wait to discuss matters, but, firing her first shot at\\r\\na range of about 3,700 yards, steamed north as hard as she could go. At\\r\\nfirst the firing of the Emden seemed excellent, while that of the Sydney\\r\\nwas somewhat erratic. This, as I afterward learned, was due to the fact\\r\\nthat the Australian cruiser\\'s range finder was put out of action by one\\r\\nof the only two shots the Germans got home. However, the British gunners\\r\\nsoon overcame any difficulties that this may have caused, and settled\\r\\ndown to their work, so that before long two of the Emden\\'s funnels had\\r\\nbeen shot away. She also lost one of her masts quite early in the fight.\\r\\nBoth blazing away with their big guns the two cruisers disappeared below\\r\\nthe horizon, the Emden being on fire.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Early the next morning, Tuesday, November 10th, we saw the Sydney\\r\\nreturning, and at 8.45 A. M. she anchored off the island. From various\\r\\nmembers of the crew I gathered some details of the running fight with\\r\\nthe Emden. The Sydney, having an advantage in speed, was able to keep\\r\\nout of range of the Emden\\'s guns, and to bombard with her own heavier\\r\\nmetal. The engagement lasted eighty minutes, the Emden finally running\\r\\nashore on North Keeling Island, and becoming an utter wreck. Only two\\r\\nGerman shots proved effective, one of these failed to explode, but\\r\\nsmashed the main range finder and killed one man, the other killed three\\r\\nmen and wounded fourteen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Each of the cruisers attempted to torpedo the other, but both were\\r\\nunsuccessful, and the duel proved a contest in hard pounding at long\\r\\nrange. The Sydney\\'s speed during the fighting was twenty-six knots, and\\r\\nthe Emden\\'s twenty-four knots. The British ship\\'s superiority of two\\r\\nknots enabled her to choose the range at which the battle should be\\r\\nfought and to make the most of her superior guns. Finally, with a number\\r\\nof wounded prisoners on board, the Sydney left here yesterday, and our\\r\\nfew hours of war excitement were over.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Mucke\\'s return home from the Cocos Island was filled with the\\r\\nmost extraordinary adventures, and when he finally arrived in country\\r\\ncontrolled by his Allies he was greeted as a hero.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the story of the Emden especially interested the world, the\\r\\nKoenigsberg also caused much trouble to English commerce. Her chief\\r\\nexploit occurred on the 20th of September, when she caught the British\\r\\ncruiser Pegasus in Zanzibar harbor undergoing repairs. The Pegasus had\\r\\nno chance, and was destroyed by the Koenigsberg\\'s long-range fire.\\r\\nNothing much was heard later of the Koenigsberg, which was finally\\r\\ndestroyed by an English cruiser, July 11, 1915.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exploits of these two German commerce raiders attracted general\\r\\nattention, because they were the exceptions to the rule. The British, on\\r\\nthe other hand, were able to capture such German merchantmen as ventured\\r\\non the sea without great difficulty, and as they did not destroy their\\r\\ncapture, but brought them before prize courts, the incidents attracted\\r\\nno great attention. The Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse, which had been fitted\\r\\nup as a commerce destroyer by the Germans at the beginning of the war,\\r\\nas was the Spreewald of the Hamburg-American Line, and the Cap\\r\\nTrafalgar, were caught and sunk during the month of September. On the\\r\\nwhole, English foreign trade was unimpaired.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut though the German fleet had been bottled up in her harbors, Germany\\r\\nwas not yet impotent. There remained the submarine.\\r\\n\\r\\nUp to 1905 Germany had not a single submarine. The first German\\r\\nsubmarine was launched on August 30, 1905. Even then it was considered\\r\\nmerely an experiment. In February, 1907, it was added to the register of\\r\\nthe fleet. On January 1, 1901, there were only four nations that\\r\\npossessed submarines, France, with fourteen; the United States, with\\r\\neight; England, with six, of which not one was completed, and finally\\r\\nItaly, with two. In 1910, Germany appropriated 18,750,000 marks for\\r\\nsubmarines, and in 1913, 25,000,000 marks. On January 1, 1914, the total\\r\\nnumber of submarines of all nations was approximately four hundred.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in the war the submarine became a grave menace to the English navy\\r\\nand to English commerce. On the 5th of September the Pathfinder, a light\\r\\ncruiser, was torpedoed and sunk with great loss of life. On September\\r\\n22d, three cruisers, the Cressy, Hogue, and Aboukir were engaged in\\r\\npatrolling the coast of Holland. A great storm had been raging and the\\r\\ncruisers were not protected by the usual screen of destroyers. At\\r\\nhalf-past six in the morning the seas had fallen and the cruisers\\r\\nproceeded to their posts. The report of Commander Nicholson, of the\\r\\nCressy, of what followed gives a good idea of the effectiveness of the\\r\\nsubmarine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Aboukir,\" says this report, \"was struck at about 6.25 A. M. on the\\r\\nstarboard beam. The Hogue and Cressy closed, and took up a position, the\\r\\nHogue ahead of the Aboukir, and the Cressy about four hundred yards on\\r\\nher port beam. As soon as it was seen that the Aboukir was in danger of\\r\\nsinking, all the boats were sent away from the Cressy, and a picket boat\\r\\nwas hoisted out without steam up. When cutters full of the Aboukir\\'s men\\r\\nwere returning to the Cressy, the Hogue was struck, apparently under the\\r\\naft 9.2 magazine, as a very heavy explosion took place immediately.\\r\\nAlmost directly after the Hogue was hit we observed a periscope on our\\r\\nport bow about three hundred yards off. Fire was immediately opened, and\\r\\nthe engines were put full speed ahead with the intention of running her\\r\\ndown. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Captain Johnson then maneuvered the ship so as to render assistance to\\r\\nthe crews of the Hogue and Aboukir. About five minutes later another\\r\\nperiscope was seen on our starboard quarter, and fire was opened. The\\r\\ntrack of the torpedo she fired at a range of from 500 to 600 yards was\\r\\nplainly visible, and it struck us on the starboard side just before the\\r\\nafter bridge. The ship listed about ten degrees to the starboard and\\r\\nremained steady. The time was 7.15 A. M. All the water-tight doors, dead\\r\\nlights and scuttles had been securely closed before the torpedoes left\\r\\nthe ship. All mess stools and table shores and all available timber\\r\\nbelow and on deck had been previously got up and thrown overside for the\\r\\nsaving of life. A second torpedo fired by the same submarine missed and\\r\\npassed about ten feet astern.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About a quarter of an hour after the first torpedo had hit, a third\\r\\ntorpedo fired from the submarine just before the starboard beam, hit us\\r\\nunder the No. 5 boiler room. The time was 7.30 A. M. The ship then began\\r\\nto heel rapidly, and finally turned keel up remaining so for about\\r\\ntwenty minutes before she finally sank. It is possible that the same\\r\\nsubmarine fired all three torpedoes at the Cressy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the total crews of 1,459 officers and men only 779 were saved. The\\r\\nsurvivors believed that they had seen at least three submarines, but the\\r\\nGerman official account mentions only one, the U-9, under\\r\\nCaptain-Lieutenant Otto Weddigen whose account of this battle confirms\\r\\nthe report of Commander Nicholson. Referring to the reports that a\\r\\nflotilla of German submarines had attacked the cruisers, he says:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These reports were absolutely untrue. U-9 was the only submarine on\\r\\ndeck.\" He adds: \"I reached the home port on the afternoon of the 23d and\\r\\non the 24th went to Wilhelmshaven to find that news of my effort had\\r\\nbecome public. My wife, dry-eyed when I went away, met me with tears.\\r\\nThen I learned that my little vessel and her brave crew had won the\\r\\nplaudit of the Kaiser who conferred upon each of my co-workers the Iron\\r\\nCross of the second class and upon me the Iron Crosses of the first and\\r\\nsecond classes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWeddigen was the hero of the hour in Germany. He had with him\\r\\ntwenty-five men. He seems to have acted with courage and skill, but it\\r\\nis also evident that the English staff work was to blame. Three such\\r\\nvessels should never have been sent out without a screen of destroyers,\\r\\nnor should the Hogue and the Cressy have gone to the rescue of the\\r\\nAboukir. A few days after the disaster the English Admiralty issued the\\r\\nfollowing statement:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sinking of the Aboukir was of course an ordinary hazard of\\r\\npatrolling duty. The Hogue and Cressy, however, were sunk because they\\r\\nproceeded to the assistance of their consort, and remained with engines\\r\\nstopped, endeavoring to save life, thus presenting an easy target to\\r\\nfurther submarine attacks. The natural promptings of humanity have in\\r\\nthis case led to heavy losses, which would have been avoided by a strict\\r\\nadhesion to military consideration. Modern naval war is presenting us\\r\\nwith so many new and strange situations that an error of judgment of\\r\\nthis character is pardonable. But it has become necessary to point out\\r\\nfor the future guidance of His Majesty\\'s ships that the conditions which\\r\\nprevail when one vessel of a squadron is injured in the mine field, or\\r\\nis exposed to submarine attack, are analogous to those which occur in\\r\\naction, and that the rule of leaving ships to their own resources is\\r\\napplicable, so far, at any rate, as large vessels are concerned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 28th of August occurred the first important naval action of the\\r\\nwar, the battle of Helgoland. From the 9th of August German cruisers had\\r\\nshown activity in the seas around Helgoland and had sunk a number of\\r\\nBritish trawlers. The English submarines, E-6 and E-8, and the light\\r\\ncruiser Fearless, had patrolled the seas, and on the 21st of August the\\r\\nFearless had come under the enemy\\'s shell fire. On August 26th the\\r\\nsubmarine flotilla, under Commodore Keyes, sailed from Harwich for the\\r\\nBight of Helgoland, and all the next day the Lurcher and the Firedrake,\\r\\ndestroyers, scouted for submarines. On that same day sailed the first\\r\\nand third destroyer flotillas, the battle cruiser squadron, first light\\r\\ncruiser squadron, and the seventh cruiser squadron, having a rendezvous\\r\\nat this point on the morning of the 28th.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe morning was beautiful and clear, so that the submarines could be\\r\\neasily seen. Close to Helgoland were Commodore Keyes\\' eight submarines,\\r\\nand his two small destroyers. Approaching rapidly from the northwest\\r\\nwere Commodore Tyrwhitt\\'s two destroyer flotillas, a little to the east\\r\\nwas Commodore Goodenough\\'s first light cruiser squadron. Behind this\\r\\nsquadron were Sir David Beatty\\'s battle cruisers with four destroyers.\\r\\nTo the south and west of Helgoland lay Admiral Christian\\'s seventh\\r\\ncruiser squadron.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently from behind Helgoland came a number of German destroyers,\\r\\nfollowed by two cruisers; and the English submarines, with the two small\\r\\ndestroyers, fled westwards, acting as a decoy. As the Germans followed,\\r\\nthe British destroyer flotillas on the northwest came rapidly down. At\\r\\nthe sight of these destroyers the German destroyers fled, and the\\r\\nBritish attempted to head them off.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the official report the principle of the movement was to\\r\\ncut the German light craft from home, and engage it at leisure on the\\r\\nopen sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut between the two German cruisers and the English cruisers a fierce\\r\\nbattle took place. The Arethusa was engaged with the German Ariadne, and\\r\\nthe Fearless with the Strasburg. A shot from the Arethusa shattered the\\r\\nfore bridge of the Ariadne and killed the captain, and both German\\r\\ncruisers drew off toward Helgoland.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the destroyers were engaged in a hot fight. They sunk the\\r\\nleading boat of the German flotilla and damaged a dozen more. Between\\r\\nnine and ten o\\'clock there was a lull in the fight; the submarines, with\\r\\nsome of the destroyers, remained in the neighborhood of Helgoland, and\\r\\nthe Germans, believing that these boats were the only hostile vessels in\\r\\nthe neighborhood, determined to attack them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mainz, the Koln, and the Strasburg came again on the scene, and\\r\\nopened a heavy fire on some of the boats of the first flotilla which\\r\\nwere busy saving life. The small destroyers were driven away, but the\\r\\nseamen in the boats were rescued by an English submarine. The Arethusa\\r\\nand the Fearless, with the destroyers in their company, engaged with\\r\\nthree enemy cruisers. The Strasburg, seriously injured, was compelled to\\r\\nflee. The boilers of the Mainz blew up, and she became a wreck. The Koln\\r\\nonly remaining and carrying on the fight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe English destroyers were much crippled, and as the battle had now\\r\\nlasted for five hours any moment the German great battleships might come\\r\\non the scene. A wireless signal had been sent to Sir David Beatty,\\r\\nasking for help, and about twelve o\\'clock the Falmouth and the\\r\\nNottingham arrived on the scene of action. By this time the first\\r\\ndestroyer flotilla was out of action and the third flotilla and the\\r\\nArethusa had their hands full with the Koln. The light cruisers were\\r\\nfollowed at 12.15 by the English battle cruisers, the Lion came first,\\r\\nand she alone among the battle cruisers seems to have used her guns. Her\\r\\ngun power beat down all opposition. The Koln made for home, but the\\r\\nLion\\'s guns set her on fire. The luckless Ariadne hove in sight, but the\\r\\nterrible 13.5-inch guns sufficed for her. The battle cruisers circled\\r\\naround, and in ten minutes the Koln went to the bottom.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt twenty minutes to two, Admiral Beatty turned homeward. The German\\r\\ncruisers Mainz, Koln, and the Ariadne had been sunk; the Strasburg was\\r\\nseriously damaged. One destroyer was sunk, and at least seven seriously\\r\\ninjured. About seven hundred of the German crew perished and there were\\r\\nthree hundred prisoners. The British force returned without the loss of\\r\\na single ship. The Arethusa had been badly damaged, but was easily\\r\\nrepaired. The casualty list was thirty-two killed and fifty-two wounded.\\r\\nThe battle was fought on both sides with great gallantry, the chief\\r\\nglory belonging to the Arethusa and the Fearless who bore the brunt of\\r\\nthe battle. The strategy and tactical skill employed were admirable, and\\r\\nthe German admiral, von Ingenohl from that time on, with one exception,\\r\\nkept his battleships in harbor, and confined his activities to mine\\r\\nlaying and the use of submarines.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first days of the war the German mine layers had been busy. By\\r\\nmeans of trawlers disguised as neutrals, mines were dropped off the\\r\\nnorth coast of Ireland, and a large mine field was laid off the eastern\\r\\ncoast of England. One of the most important duties of the Royal Naval\\r\\nReserve was the task of mine sweeping. Over seven hundred mine-sweeping\\r\\nvessels were constantly employed in keeping an area of 7,200 square\\r\\nmiles clear for shipping. These ships swept 15,000 square miles monthly,\\r\\nand steamed over 1,100,000 miles in carrying out their duties.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be hard to overestimate the effect of the British blockade of\\r\\nthe German ports upon the fortunes of the war. The Germans for a long\\r\\ntime attempted, by the use of neutral ships, to obtain the necessary\\r\\nsupplies through Holland, Sweden, Norway, and Switzerland. Millions of\\r\\ndollars\\' worth of food and munitions ultimately reached German hands.\\r\\nThe imports of all these nations were multiplied many times, but as the\\r\\ntime went on the blockade grew stricter and stricter until the Germans\\r\\nfelt the pinch. To conduct efficiently this blockade meant the use of\\r\\nover 3,600 vessels which were added to the auxiliary patrol service.\\r\\nOver 13,000 vessels were intercepted and examined by units of the\\r\\nBritish navy employed on blockade channels.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Germans protested with great vigor against this blockade, and\\r\\nultimately endeavored to counteract it by declaring unrestricted\\r\\nsubmarine warfare. In fact, Great Britain had gone too far, and vigorous\\r\\nprotests from America followed her attempt to seize contraband goods in\\r\\nAmerican vessels.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe code of maritime law, adopted in the Declaration at Paris of 1856,\\r\\nas well as the Declaration in London of 1909, had been framed in the\\r\\ninterests of unmaritime nations. The British plenipotentiaries had\\r\\nagreed to these laws on the theory that in any war of the future Britain\\r\\nwould be neutral. The rights of neutrals had been greatly increased. A\\r\\nblockade was difficult to enforce, for the right of a blockading power\\r\\nto capture a blockade runner did not cover the whole period of her\\r\\nvoyage, and was confined to ships of the blockading force. A ship\\r\\ncarrying contraband could only be condemned if the contraband formed\\r\\nmore than half its cargo. A belligerent warship could destroy a neutral\\r\\nvessel without taking it into a port for a judgment. The transfer of an\\r\\nenemy vessel to a neutral flag was presumed to be valid, if effected\\r\\nmore than thirty days before the outbreak of war. Belligerents in\\r\\nneutral vessels on the high seas were exempt from capture. The Emden\\r\\ncould justify its sinking of British ships, but the English were\\r\\nhandicapped in their endeavor to prevent neutral ships from carrying\\r\\nsupplies to Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Germany had become a law unto itself. And England found it necessary\\r\\nin retaliation to issue orders in council which made nugatory many of\\r\\nthe provisions of the maritime code. The protests of the American\\r\\nGovernment and those of other neutrals were treated with the greatest\\r\\nconsideration, and every endeavor was made that no real injustice should\\r\\nbe done. When America itself later entered the war these differences of\\r\\nopinion disappeared from public view.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XI\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SUBLIME PORTE\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as the diplomatic relations between Austria and Serbia had been\\r\\nbroken, the Turkish Grand Vizier informed the diplomatic corps in\\r\\nConstantinople that Turkey would remain neutral in the conflict. The\\r\\ndeclaration was not formal, for war had not yet been declared. The\\r\\npolicy of Turkey, as represented in the ministerial paper,\\r\\nTasfiri-Efkiar, was as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Turkey has never asked for war, as she always has worked toward\\r\\navoiding it, but neutrality does not mean indifference. The present\\r\\nAustro-Serbian conflict is to a supreme degree interesting to us. In the\\r\\nfirst place, one of our erstwhile opponents is fighting against a much\\r\\nstronger enemy. In the natural course of things Serbia, which till\\r\\nlately was expressing, in a rather open way, her solidarity as a nation,\\r\\nstill provoking us, and Greece, will be materially weakened. In the\\r\\nsecond place, the results of this war may surpass the limits of the\\r\\nconflict between two countries, and in that case our interests will be\\r\\njust as materially affected. We must, therefore, keep our eyes open, as\\r\\nthe circumstances are momentarily changing, and do not permit us to let\\r\\nescape certain advantages which we can secure by active, and rightly\\r\\nacting, diplomacy. The policy of neutrality will impose on us the\\r\\nobligation of avoiding to side with either of the belligerents. But the\\r\\nsame policy will force us to take all the necessary measures for\\r\\nsafeguarding our interests and our frontiers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhereupon a Turkish mobilization was at once ordered. The war had hardly\\r\\nbegun when Turkey received the news that her two battleships, building\\r\\nin British yards, had been taken over by England. A bitter feeling\\r\\nagainst England was at once aroused, Turkish mobs proceeded to attack\\r\\nthe British stores and British subjects, and attempts were even made\\r\\nagainst the British embassy in Constantinople, and the British consulate\\r\\nat Smyrna.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this time Turkey was in a peculiar position. For a century she had\\r\\nbeen on the best of terms with France and Great Britain. On the other\\r\\nhand Russia had been her hereditary enemy. She was still suffering from\\r\\nher defeat by the Balkan powers, and her statesmen saw in this war great\\r\\npossibilities. She desired to recover her lost provinces in Europe, and\\r\\nsaw at once that she could hope for little from the Allies in this\\r\\ndirection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map: Black Sea to the North, Caspian Sea to the East,\\r\\nPersian Gulf to South, Crete to the West.]\\r\\n  SKETCH OF TERRITORY CONTROLLED BY TURKEY IN 1914\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some years, too, German intrigues, and, according to report, German\\r\\nmoney, had enabled the German Government to control the leading Turkish\\r\\nstatesmen. German generals, under General Liman von Sanders, were\\r\\npractically in control of the Turkish army. The commander-in-chief was\\r\\nEnver Bey, who had been educated in Germany and was more German than the\\r\\nGermans. A new system of organization for the Turkish army had been\\r\\nestablished by the Germans, which had substituted the mechanical German\\r\\nsystem for the rough and inefficient Turkish methods. Universal\\r\\nconscription provided men, and the Turkish soldier has always been known\\r\\nas a good soldier. Yet as it turned out the German training did little\\r\\nfor him. Under his own officers he could fight well, but under German\\r\\nofficers, fighting for a cause which he neither liked nor understood, he\\r\\nwas bound to fail.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first the Turkish mobilization was conducted in such a way as to be\\r\\nready to act in common with Bulgaria in an attack against Greek and\\r\\nSerbian Macedonia, as soon as the Austrians had obtained a decisive\\r\\nvictory over the Serbians. The entry of Great Britain into the war\\r\\ninterfered with this scheme. Meantime, though not at war, the Turks were\\r\\nsuffering almost as much as if war had been declared. Greedy speculators\\r\\ntook advantage of the situation, and the government itself requisitioned\\r\\neverything it could lay its hands on.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Constantinople correspondent, writing on the 6th of August, says as\\r\\nfollows;\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Policemen and sheriffs followed by military officers are taking by\\r\\nforce everything in the way of foodstuffs, entering the bakeries and\\r\\nother shops selling victuals, boarding ships with cargoes of flour,\\r\\npotatoes, wheat and rice, and taking over virtually everything, giving\\r\\nin lieu of payment a receipt which is not worth even the paper on which\\r\\nit is written. In this way many shops are forced to close, bread has\\r\\nentirely disappeared from the bakeries, and Constantinople, the capital\\r\\nof a neutral country, is already feeling all the troubles and privations\\r\\nof a besieged city. Prices for foodstuffs have soared to inaccessible\\r\\nheights, as provisions are becoming scarce. Actual hand-to-hand combats\\r\\nare taking place in the streets outside the bakeries for the possession\\r\\nof a loaf of bread, and hungry women with children in their arms are\\r\\nseen crying and weeping with despair. Many merchants, afraid lest the\\r\\ngovernment requisition their goods, hasten to have their orders\\r\\ncanceled, the result being that no merchandise of any kind is coming to\\r\\nConstantinople either from Europe or from Anatolia. Both on account of\\r\\nthe recruiting of their employees, and of shortage of coal, the\\r\\ncompanies operating electric tramways of the city have reduced their\\r\\nservice to the minimum, as no power is available for the running of the\\r\\ncars. Heartrending scenes are witnessed in front of the closed doors of\\r\\nthe various banking establishments, where large posters are to be seen\\r\\nbearing the inscription \\'Closed temporarily by order of the government.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately after war was declared between Germany and Russia the Porte\\r\\nordered the Bosporus and Dardanelles closed to every kind of shipping,\\r\\nat the same time barring the entrances of these channels with rows of\\r\\nmines. The first boat to suffer from this measure was a British\\r\\nmerchantman which was sunk outside the Bosporus, while another had a\\r\\nnarrow escape in the Dardanelles. A large number of steamers of every\\r\\nnationality waited outside the straits for the special pilot boats of\\r\\nthe Turkish Government, in order to pass in safety through the dangerous\\r\\nmine field. This measure of closing the straits was suggested to Turkey\\r\\nby Austria and Germany, and was primarily intended against Russia, as it\\r\\nwas feared that her Black Sea fleet might force its way into the Sea of\\r\\nMarmora and the AEgean.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 2d the Turkish Parliament was prorogued, so that all political\\r\\npower might center around the Imperial throne. A vigorous endeavor was\\r\\nmade to strengthen the Turkish navy. Djemal Pasha was placed at its head\\r\\nwith Arif Bey as chief of the naval staff. Talaat Bey and Halil Bey were\\r\\nsent to Bucharest to exchange views with Roumanian statesmen, and\\r\\nrepresentatives of the Greek Government, in regard to the outstanding\\r\\nGreco-Turkish difficulties.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 10th an official announcement from the Sublime Porte was\\r\\nissued defining in the first place many constitutional reforms, and in\\r\\nparticular abolishing the capitulation, that is, the concessions made by\\r\\nlaw to foreigners, allowing them participation in the administration of\\r\\njustice, exemption from taxation, and special protection in their\\r\\nbusiness transactions. In abolishing these capitulations the Ottoman\\r\\nGovernment declared that it would treat foreign countries in accordance\\r\\nwith the rules of international law, and that it was acting without any\\r\\nhostile feeling against any of the foreign states.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Allied governments formally protested against this action of the\\r\\nTurkish Government. Meantime Constantinople was the center of most\\r\\nelaborate intrigues. The Turkish Government grew more and more warlike,\\r\\nand began to threaten, not only Greece, but Russia and the Triple\\r\\nEntente as well. During this period the Turkish press maintained an\\r\\nactive campaign against England and the Allies. Every endeavor was made\\r\\nby the Sublime Porte to secure Roumanian or Bulgarian co-operation in a\\r\\nmilitant policy. The Allies, seeing the situation, made many promises to\\r\\nBulgaria, Greece and Roumania. Bulgaria was offered Adrianople and\\r\\nThrace; Greece was to have Smyrna, and Roumania the Roumanian provinces\\r\\nin Austria. The jealousy of these powers of each other prevented an\\r\\nagreement. The influence of Germany became more and more preponderant\\r\\nwith the Ottoman Empire; indeed, it is probable that an understanding\\r\\nhad existed between the two powers from the beginning. The action of the\\r\\nTurkish Government in regard to the Goeben and Breslau could hardly have\\r\\nbeen possible unless with a previous understanding. At last the rupture\\r\\ncame. The following was the official Turkish version of the events which\\r\\nled to the Turkish declaration of war:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"While on the 27th of October a small part of the Turkish fleet was\\r\\nmaneuvering on the Black Sea, the Russian fleet, which at first confined\\r\\nits activities to following and hindering every one of our movements,\\r\\nfinally, on the 29th, unexpectedly began hostilities by attacking the\\r\\nOttoman fleet. During the naval battle which ensued the Turkish fleet,\\r\\nwith the help of the Almighty, sank the mine layer Pruth, inflicted\\r\\nsevere damage on one of the Russian torpedo boats, and captured a\\r\\ncollier. A torpedo from the Turkish torpedo boat Gairet-i-Millet sank\\r\\nthe Russian destroyer Koubanietz, and another from the Turkish torpedo\\r\\nboat Mouavenet-i-Millet inflicted serious damage on a Russian coast\\r\\nguard ship. Three officers and seventy-two sailors rescued by our men\\r\\nand belonging to the crews of the damaged and sunken vessels of the\\r\\nRussian fleet have been made prisoners. The Ottoman Imperial fleet,\\r\\nglory be given to the Almighty, escaped injury, and the battle is\\r\\nprogressing favorably for us. Information received from our fleet, now\\r\\nin the Black Sea, is as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From accounts of Russian sailors taken prisoners, and from the presence\\r\\nof a mine layer among the Russian fleet, evidence is gathered that the\\r\\nRussian fleet intended closing the entrance to the Bosporus with mines,\\r\\nand destroying entirely the Imperial Ottoman fleet, after having split\\r\\nit in two. Our fleet, believing that it had to face an unexpected\\r\\nattack, and supposing that the Russians had begun hostilities without a\\r\\nformal declaration of war, pursued the scattered Russian fleet,\\r\\nbombarded the port of Sebastopol, destroyed in the city of Novorossisk\\r\\nfifty petroleum depots, fourteen military transports, some granaries,\\r\\nand the wireless telegraph station. In addition to the above our fleet\\r\\nhas sunk in Odessa a Russian cruiser, and damaged severely another. It\\r\\nis believed that this second boat was likewise sunk. Five other steamers\\r\\nfull of cargoes lying in the same port were seriously damaged. A\\r\\nsteamship belonging to the Russian volunteer fleet was also sunk, and\\r\\nfive petroleum depots were destroyed. In Odessa and Sebastopol the\\r\\nRussians from the shore opened fire against our fleet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photographs and Paintings]\\r\\n  FAMOUS BRITISH GENERALS\\r\\n  General Smith-Dorrien, British Corps Commander in the famous retreat\\r\\n  from Mons; Generals Plumer, Rawlinson and Byng, Commanders on the\\r\\n  Western Front; General Birdwood, Commander of the Australian-New\\r\\n  Zealand troops at Gallipoli.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photographs and Paintings]\\r\\n  FAMOUS FRENCH GENERALS\\r\\n  Marshal Petain, Commander-in-Chief of the French armies in the West;\\r\\n  Generals Mangin, Gouraud and Humbert, Army Commanders in the West;\\r\\n  Generals Gallieni, Commander of Paris, who sent forward an army in\\r\\n  taxicabs to save the day at the First Battle of the Marne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sultan at once declared war against Russia, England and France, and\\r\\nissued a proclamation to his troops, declaring that he had called them\\r\\nto arms to resist aggression and that \"the very existence of our Empire\\r\\nand of three hundred million Moslems whom I have summoned by sacred\\r\\nFetwa to a supreme struggle, depend on your victory. Do not forget that\\r\\nyou are brothers in arms of the strongest and bravest armies of the\\r\\nworld, with whom we are now fighting shoulder to shoulder.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fetwa, or proclamation announcing a holy war, called upon all\\r\\nMussulmans capable of carrying arms, and even upon Mussulman women to\\r\\nfight against the powers with whom the Sultan was at war. In this manner\\r\\nthe holy war became a duty, not only for all Ottoman subjects, but for\\r\\nthe three hundred million Moslems of the earth. On November 5th Great\\r\\nBritain declared war against Turkey, ordered the seizure in British\\r\\nports of Turkish vessels, and, by an order in Council, annexed the\\r\\nIsland of Cyprus. On the 17th of December, the Khedive Abbas II, having\\r\\nthrown in his lot with Turkey and fled to Constantinople, Egypt was\\r\\nformally proclaimed a British Protectorate. The title of Khedive was\\r\\nabolished, and the throne of Egypt, with the title of Sultan, was\\r\\noffered to Prince Hussein Kamel Pasha, the eldest living prince of the\\r\\nhouse of Mahomet Ali, an able and enlightened man. This meant that\\r\\nBritain was now wholly responsible for the defense of Egypt. The new\\r\\nSultan of Egypt made his state entry on December 20th into the Abdin\\r\\nPalace in Cairo. The progress of the new ruler was received with great\\r\\nenthusiasm by thousands of spectators.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe King of England sent a telegram of congratulation with his promise\\r\\nof support:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the occasion when your Highness enters upon your high office I desire\\r\\nto convey to your Highness the expression of my most sincere friendship,\\r\\nand the assurance of my unfailing support in safeguarding the integrity\\r\\nof Egypt, and in securing her future well being and prosperity. Your\\r\\nHighness has been called upon to undertake the responsibilities of your\\r\\nhigh office at a grave crisis in the national life of Egypt, and I feel\\r\\nconvinced that you will be able, with the co-operation of your\\r\\nMinisters, and the Protectorate of Great Britain, successfully to\\r\\novercome all the influences which are seeking to destroy the\\r\\nindependence of Egypt and the wealth, liberty and happiness of its\\r\\npeople.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was Britain\\'s answer to the Turkish proclamation of war. The Turks\\r\\nhad not taken this warlike course with entire unanimity. The Sultan, the\\r\\nGrand Vizier, and Djavid Bey were in favor of peace, but Enver Pasha and\\r\\nhis colleagues overruled them. The Odessa incident was unjustified\\r\\naggression, deliberately planned to provoke hostilities. The tricky and\\r\\ncorrupt German diplomacy had won its point.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is interesting to observe that the proclamation of the holy war, a\\r\\nfavorite German scheme, fell flat. The Kaiser, and his advisers, had\\r\\ncounted much upon this raising of the sacred flag. The Kaiser had\\r\\nvisited Constantinople and permitted himself to be exploited as a\\r\\nsympathizer with Mohammedanism. Photographs of him had been taken\\r\\nrepresenting him in Mohammedan garb, accompanied by Moslem priests, and\\r\\na report had been deliberately circulated throughout Turkey that he had\\r\\nbecome a Moslem. The object of this camouflage was to stir up the\\r\\nMohammedans in the countries controlled by England, risings were hoped\\r\\nfor in Egypt and India, and German spies had been distributed through\\r\\nthose countries to encourage religious revolts. But there was almost no\\r\\nresponse. The Sultan, it is true, was the head of the Church, but who\\r\\nwas the Sultan? The old Sultan, now dethroned, and imprisoned, or this\\r\\nnew and insignificant creature placed on the throne by the young Turk\\r\\nparty? The Mohammedan did not feel himself greatly moved.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the beginning of the war Turkey found herself unable to make any move\\r\\nto recover her provinces in Thrace. Greece and Bulgaria were neutral,\\r\\nand could not be attacked. Placing herself, therefore, in the hands of\\r\\nher German advisers, she moved her new army to those frontiers where it\\r\\ncould meet the powers with whom she was at war. In particular Germany\\r\\nand Austria desired her aid in Transcaucasia against the Russian armies.\\r\\nAn attack upon Russia from that quarter would mean that many troops\\r\\nwhich otherwise would have been used against the Central Powers must be\\r\\nsent to the Caucasus. The Suez Canal, too, must be attacked. An\\r\\nexpedition there would compel Great Britain to send out troops, and\\r\\nperhaps would encourage the hoped-for rebellion in Egypt and give an\\r\\nopportunity for religious insurrection in India, where the Djehad was\\r\\nbeing preached among the Mohammedan tribes in the northwest. The\\r\\nDardanelles, to be sure, might be threatened but the Germans had sent\\r\\nthere many heavy guns and fortifications had been built which, in expert\\r\\nopinion, made Constantinople safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Turkish offensive along her eastern frontier in Transcaucasia and\\r\\nin Persia was first undertaken. The Persian Gulf had long been\\r\\ncontrolled by Great Britain; even in the days of Elizabeth the East\\r\\nIndia Company had fought with Dutch and Portuguese rivals for control of\\r\\nits commerce. The English had protected Persia, suppressed piracy and\\r\\nslavery, and introduced sanitary measures in the marshes along the\\r\\ncoast. They regarded a control of the Persian Gulf as necessary for the\\r\\nprosperity of India and the Empire. The Turkish Government had never had\\r\\ngreat power along the Persian Gulf. Bagdad, indeed, had been captured by\\r\\nSuleiman the Magnificent in the sixteenth century, but in eastern Arabia\\r\\nlived many independent Arabian chieftains who had no idea of subjecting\\r\\nthemselves to Turkish rule.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor years Germany had been looking with jealous eyes in this direction.\\r\\nHer elaborate intrigues with Turkey were mainly designed to open up the\\r\\nway to the Persian Gulf. She had planned a great railway to open up\\r\\ntrade, and her endeavor to build the Bagdad Railway is a story in\\r\\nitself. Her efforts had lasted for many years, but she found herself\\r\\nconstantly blocked by the agents of Great Britain.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the Ottoman troops were ready, the British in the Gulf had made a\\r\\nstart. On November 7th a British force under Brigadier-General Delamain\\r\\nbombarded the Turkish fort at Falon, landed troops and occupied the\\r\\nvillage. Sailing north from this point they disembarked at Sanijah,\\r\\nwhere they intrenched themselves and waited for reinforcements. On\\r\\nNovember 13th reinforcements arrived, and on November 17th the British\\r\\narmy advanced toward Sahain. From there they moved on Sahil, where they\\r\\nencountered a Turkish force. Some lively fighting ensued and the Turks\\r\\nbroke and fled. Turkish casualties were about one thousand five hundred\\r\\nmen, the English killed numbered thirty-eight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British then moved on Basra, moving by steamer along the\\r\\nShat-el-Arab River. On November 22d Basra was reached and it was found\\r\\nthat the Turks had evacuated the place. A base camp was then prepared,\\r\\nfor it was certain that there would be further fighting. Bagdad was only\\r\\nabout three hundred miles distant; and fifty miles above Basra, at the\\r\\njunction of the Tigris and the Euphrates, lies the town of Kurna where\\r\\nthe Turks were gathering an army. On December 4th an attack was made on\\r\\nKurna but without success. The British obtained reinforcements, but on\\r\\nDecember 9th the Turkish garrison surrendered unconditionally. The\\r\\nBritish troops then intrenched themselves, having established a\\r\\nbarricade against a hostile advance upon India.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarther north the war was between Turkey and Russia. Since Persia had no\\r\\nmilitary power, each combatant was able to occupy that country whenever\\r\\nthey desired. The Turks advanced into Persia south of Lake Urmia, and,\\r\\nmeeting with no resistance from Persia, moved northward toward the\\r\\nRussian frontier. On the 30th of January, 1915, Russian troops heavily\\r\\ndefeated the invaders and followed them south as far as Tabriz, which\\r\\nthey occupied and held. The Russian armies had also undertaken movements\\r\\nin this section. In the extreme northwest of Persia a Russian column had\\r\\ncrossed the frontier, and occupied, on the 3d of November, the town of\\r\\nBayazid close to Mt. Ararat. Other columns entered Kurdestan, and an\\r\\nexpedition against Van was begun. Further north another Russian column\\r\\ncrossed the frontier and captured the town of Karakilissa, but was held\\r\\nthere by the Turks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese were minor expeditions. The real struggle was in Transcaucasia,\\r\\nwhere the main body of the Turkish army under Enver Pasha himself was in\\r\\naction. At this point the boundaries of Turkey touch upon the Russian\\r\\nEmpire. To the north is the Great Russian fortress of Kars, to the south\\r\\nand west the Turkish stronghold of Erzerum. The whole district is a\\r\\ngreat mountain tangle, the towns standing at an altitude of 5,000 and\\r\\n6,000 feet, surrounded by lofty hills. None of the roads are good, and\\r\\nin winter the passes are almost impassable. In all the wars between\\r\\nRussia and Turkey, these mountain regions have been the scenes of\\r\\ndesperate battles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Turkish plan of battle was to entice the Russians from Sarakamish\\r\\nacross the frontier, leading them on to some distance from their base,\\r\\nthen, while holding their front, a second force was to swing around and\\r\\nattack them on the left flank. The plan was simple, the difficulty was\\r\\nthe swing of the left flank, which had to be made through mountain\\r\\npaths, deeply covered with snow. The Turkish army was composed of about\\r\\n150,000 men under the command of Hassan Izzet Pasha, but Enver, with a\\r\\nlarge German staff was the true commander. The Russian army, under\\r\\nGeneral Woronzov was about 100,000 men.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in November the Russians crossed the frontier and reached\\r\\nKoprikeui, which they occupied on the 20th of November. The Turkish\\r\\nEleventh corps was entrusted with the duty of holding the Russian\\r\\nforces; the remainder of the army was to advance over the passes and\\r\\ntake their stations behind the Russian right. On December 25th the\\r\\nTurkish attack began. The Eleventh corps forced back the Russians from\\r\\nKoprikeui to Khorasan, while the extreme Turkish left was endeavoring to\\r\\noutflank them. But the weather was desperate. A blizzard was sweeping\\r\\ndown the steeps. The Turkish forces were indeed able to carry out the\\r\\nplan, for they obtained the position desired. But by this time they were\\r\\nworn out, and half starved, and their attack on New Year\\'s Day resulted\\r\\nin their defeat and retreat. The Ninth corps was utterly wiped out, and\\r\\nthe remainder of the Turkish forces driven off in confusion. Only the\\r\\nstrenuous efforts of the Turkish Eleventh corps prevented a debacle.\\r\\nAfter a three days\\' battle it, too, was broken, and with heavy losses it\\r\\nretreated toward Erzerum. The snowdrifts and blizzards must have\\r\\naccounted for not less than 50,000 of the Turkish troops. The result of\\r\\nthe battle made Russia safe in the Caucasus.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Germans had another use for the Turkish forces. England was in\\r\\ncontrol of Egypt and the Suez Canal. The German view of England\\'s\\r\\nposition has been well stated by Dr. Paul Rohrbach:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As soon as England acquired Egypt it was incumbent upon her to guard\\r\\nagainst any menace from Asia. Such a danger apparently arose when\\r\\nTurkey, weakened by her last war with Russia and by difficult conditions\\r\\nat home, began to turn to Germany for support. And now war has come, and\\r\\nEngland is reaping the crops which she has sown. England, not we,\\r\\ndesired this war. She knows this, despite all her hypocritical talk, and\\r\\nshe fears that, as soon as connection is established along the\\r\\nBerlin-Vienna-Budapest-Sofia-Constantinople Line, the fate of Egypt\\r\\nmay be decided. Through the Suez Canal goes the route to all the lands\\r\\nsurrounding the Indian Ocean, and by way of Singapore to the western\\r\\nshores of the Pacific. These two worlds together have about nine hundred\\r\\nmillion inhabitants, more than half the population of the universe, and\\r\\nIndia lies in a controlling position in their midst. Should England lose\\r\\nthe Suez Canal she will be obliged, unlike the powers in control of that\\r\\nwaterway, to use the long route around the Cape of Good Hope, and depend\\r\\non the good will of the South African Boers. The majority among the\\r\\nlatter have not the same views as Botha. However, it is too early to\\r\\nprophesy, and it is not according to German ideas to imitate our\\r\\nopponents by singing premature paeans of victory. But anyhow we are well\\r\\naware why anxious England already sees us on the road to India.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing out this view a Turkish force was directed toward the Suez\\r\\nCanal, while the German intriguers did their best to stir up revolt in\\r\\nEgypt itself. The story of Egypt is one of the most interesting parts of\\r\\nthe world\\'s history. In the early days of the world it led mankind. Its\\r\\npeculiar geographical position at first gave it strength, and afterward\\r\\nmade it the prize for which all nations were ready to contend. In 1517\\r\\nthe Sultan Selim conquered Egypt and made it part of the Turkish realm,\\r\\nand in spite of many changes the sovereignty of Constantinople had\\r\\ncontinued. In recent years the misgovernment of the Khedive Ismael had\\r\\nbrought into its control France and Britain; then came the deposition of\\r\\nIsmael, the revolt under Arabi, the bombardment of Alexandria and the\\r\\nbattle of Tel-el-Kebir. Since then Egypt has been occupied by Great\\r\\nBritain, who restored order, defeated the armies of the Mahdi, and\\r\\nturned Egyptian bankruptcy into prosperity. Lord Kitchener was the\\r\\nEnglish hero of the wars with the Mahdi, and Lord Cromer the\\r\\nadministrator who gave the Egyptian peasant a comfort unknown since the\\r\\ndays of the Pharaohs. With prosperity came political agitation, and\\r\\nGermany, as has been seen, looked upon Egypt as fertile territory for\\r\\nGerman propaganda.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntrigue having failed in Egypt, a Turkish force was directed against\\r\\nthe Suez Canal. If that could be captured Great Britain could be cut off\\r\\nfrom India. An expeditionary army of about 65,000 men was gathered under\\r\\nthe command of Djemal Pasha, the former Turkish Minister of Marine. He\\r\\nhad been bitterly indignant at the seizure of the two Turkish\\r\\ndreadnaughts building in England, and was burning for revenge. But he\\r\\nfound great difficulties before him. To reach the Canal it was necessary\\r\\nto cross a trackless desert, varying from 120 to 150 miles in width.\\r\\nOver this desert there were three routes. The first touched the\\r\\nMediterranean coast at El-Arish and then went across the desert to\\r\\nEl-Kantara on the Canal, twenty-five miles south of Port Said. On this\\r\\nroute there were only a few wells, quite insufficient for an army. A\\r\\nsecond route ran from Akaba, on the Red Sea, across the Peninsula of\\r\\nSinai to a point a little north of Suez. This was also badly supplied\\r\\nwith wells. Between the two was the central route. Leaving the\\r\\nMediterranean at El-Arish it ran up the valley called the Wady El-Arish\\r\\nto where that valley touched the second road. There was no railway, nor\\r\\nwere these roads suitable for motor transports; for an army to move it\\r\\nwould be necessary either to build a railway or to improve the roads.\\r\\nThe best route for railway was the Wady El-Arish. The Suez Canal,\\r\\nmoreover, can be easily defended. It is over two hundred feet wide, with\\r\\nbanks rising to a height of forty feet. A railway runs along the whole\\r\\nCanal, and most of the ground to the east is flat, offering a good field\\r\\nof fire either to troops on the banks or to ships on the Canal.\\r\\n\\r\\nA considerable force of British troops, under the command of\\r\\nMajor-General Sir John Maxwell, were assigned for the protection of the\\r\\nCanal. About the end of October it was reported that 2,000 Bedouins were\\r\\nmarching on the Canal, and on November 21st a skirmish took place\\r\\nbetween this force and some of the English troops in which the Bedouins\\r\\nwere repelled. Nothing more was heard for more than two months, but on\\r\\nJanuary 28, 1915, a small advance party from the Turkish army was beaten\\r\\nback east of El-Kantara. British airmen watched the desert well and kept\\r\\nthe British army well informed of the Turkish movements. The Turks had\\r\\nfound it impossible to convey their full force across the desert, and\\r\\nthe forces which finally arrived seemed to have numbered only about\\r\\ntwelve thousand men. The main attack was not developed until February\\r\\n2d.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to an account in the London Times, on that date, the enemy\\r\\nbegan to move toward the Ismailia Ferry. They met a reconnoitering party\\r\\nof Indian troops of all arms, and a desultory engagement ensued to which\\r\\na violent sandstorm put a sudden end about three o\\'clock in the\\r\\nafternoon. The main attacking force pushed forward toward its\\r\\ndestination after nightfall. From twenty-five to thirty galvanized iron\\r\\npontoon boats, seven and a half meters in length, which had been dragged\\r\\nin carts across the desert, were hauled by hand toward the water. With\\r\\none or two rafts made of kerosene tins in a wooden frame, all was ready\\r\\nfor the attack. The first warning of the enemy\\'s approach was given by a\\r\\nsentry of a mountain battery who heard, to him, an unknown tongue across\\r\\nthe water. The noise soon increased. It would seem that Mudjah\\r\\nIdeem--\"Holy Warriors\"--said to be mostly old Tripoli fighters,\\r\\naccompanied the pontoon section, and regulars of the Seventy-fifth\\r\\nregiment, for loud exultations, often in Arabic, of \"Brothers, die for\\r\\nthe faith; we can die but once,\" betrayed the enthusiastic irregular.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Egyptians waited until the Turks were pushing their boats into the\\r\\nwater, then the Maxims attached to the battery suddenly spoke, and the\\r\\nguns opened at point-blank range at the men and boats crowded under the\\r\\nsteep bank opposite them. Immediately a violent fire broke out on both\\r\\nsides of the Canal.\\r\\n\\r\\nA little torpedo boat with a crew of thirteen, patrolling the Canal,\\r\\ndashed up and landed a party of four officers and men to the south of\\r\\nTussum, who climbed up the eastern bank and found themselves in a\\r\\nTurkish trench, and escaped by a miracle with the news. Promptly the\\r\\nmidget dashed in between the fires and enfiladed the eastern bank amid a\\r\\nhail of bullets, and destroyed several pontoon boats lying unlaunched on\\r\\nthe bank. It continued to harass the enemy, though two officers and two\\r\\nmen were wounded.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the dark, cloudy night lightened toward dawn fresh forces went into\\r\\naction. The Turks, who occupied the outer, or day, line of the Tussum\\r\\npost, advanced, covered by artillery, against the Indian troops, holding\\r\\nthe inner or night position, while an Arab regiment advanced against the\\r\\nIndian troop at the Serapeum post. The warships on the Canal and lake\\r\\njoined in the fray. The enemy brought some six batteries of field guns\\r\\ninto action from the slopes west of Kataiba-el-kaeli. Shells admirably\\r\\nfused made fine practice at all the visible targets, but failed to find\\r\\nthe battery above mentioned which with some help from a detachment of\\r\\ninfantry, beat down the fire of the riflemen on the opposite bank and\\r\\ninflicted heavy losses on the hostile supports advancing toward the\\r\\nCanal.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupported by land and naval artillery the Indian troops took the\\r\\noffensive, the Serapeum garrison, which had stopped the enemy\\r\\nthree-quarters of a mile from the position, cleared its front, and the\\r\\nTussum garrison, by a brilliant counter-attack, drove the enemy back.\\r\\nTwo battalions of Anatolians of the Twenty-eighth regiment were thrown\\r\\ninto the fight, but the artillery gave them no chance, and by 3.30 in\\r\\nthe afternoon a third of the enemy, with the exception of a force that\\r\\nlay hid in bushy hollows on the east bank between the two posts, were in\\r\\nfull retreat, leaving many dead, a large proportion of whom had been\\r\\nkilled by shrapnel. Meanwhile the warships on the lake had been in\\r\\naction, a salvo from a battleship woke up Ismailia early, and crowds of\\r\\nsoldiers and some civilians climbed every available sand hill to see\\r\\nwhat was doing, till the Turkish guns sent shells sufficiently near to\\r\\nconvince them that it was safer to watch from cover.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt about eleven in the morning two six-inch shells hit the Hardinge near\\r\\nthe southern entrance of the lake. They first damaged the funnel, and\\r\\nthe second burst inboard. Pilot Carew, a gallant old merchant seaman,\\r\\nrefused to go below when the firing opened and lost a leg. Nine others\\r\\nwere wounded, one or two merchantmen were hit but no lives were lost. A\\r\\nBritish gunboat was struck. Then came a dramatic duel between the\\r\\nTurkish big gun, or guns, and a warship. The Turks fired just over, and\\r\\nthen just short, at 9,000 yards. The warship sent in a salvo of more\\r\\nsix-inch shells than had been fired that day.\\r\\n\\r\\nLate in the afternoon of the 3d there was sniping from the east bank\\r\\nbetween Tussum and Serapeum, and a man was killed on the tops of a\\r\\nBritish battleship. Next morning the sniping was renewed and the Indian\\r\\ntroops, moving out to search the ground, found several hundred of the\\r\\nenemy in the hollow previously mentioned. During the fighting some of\\r\\nthe enemy, either by accident or design, held up their hands, while\\r\\nothers fired on the Punjabis, who were advancing to take the surrender,\\r\\nand killed a British officer. A sharp fight with the cold steel\\r\\nfollowed, and a British officer killed a Turkish officer with a sword\\r\\nthrust in single combat. A body of a German officer with a white flag\\r\\nwas afterward found here, but there is no proof that the white flag was\\r\\nused. Finally all the enemy were killed, captured or put to flight. With\\r\\nthis the fighting ended, and the subsequent operations were confined to\\r\\nthe rounding up of prisoners, and the capture of a considerable amount\\r\\nof military material left behind. The Turks, who departed with their\\r\\nguns and baggage during the night of the 3d, still seemed to be moving\\r\\neastward.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo ended the battle of the Suez Canal.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo more incidents in the Turkish campaign remain to be noticed. Report\\r\\nhaving come that the town of Akaba on the Red Sea was being used as a\\r\\nmine-laying station, H. M. S. Minerva visited the place, and found it\\r\\noccupied by soldiers under a German officer. The Minerva destroyed the\\r\\nfort and the barracks and the government buildings. Another British\\r\\ncruiser, with a detachment of Indian troops, captured the Turkish fort\\r\\nat Sheik Said, at the southern end of the Red Sea. And so for the time\\r\\nended all Turkish movements against Great Britain. That such movements\\r\\nshould have been possible seems hard to believe. For a century the\\r\\nBritish had been the friends and allies of the Turkish Government. In\\r\\nthe Crimean War their armies had fought side by side with the Turkish\\r\\ntroops against Russia. In the Russo-Turkish War Lord Beaconsfield, in\\r\\nthe negotiations which preceded the treaty of Berlin, had saved for\\r\\nTurkey much of its territory. It was only the British influence and the\\r\\nfear of the British power which had prevented Russia from taking\\r\\npossession of Constantinople a half a century before. The English had\\r\\nalways been popular in Turkey and there was every reason at the\\r\\nbeginning of the war to believe that their popularity had not waned.\\r\\nThere is reason to believe that the average Turk had little sympathy\\r\\nwith the course of his government, and if a free expression of the\\r\\npopular will had been possible the Turkish army would never have been\\r\\nsent against either the Englishmen or the Frenchmen. But long years of\\r\\nGerman propaganda had done their work. The power of Enver Pasha was\\r\\ngreater than that of the weakling Sultan and the war was forced upon the\\r\\nTurkish people by German tools and German bribes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XII\\r\\n\\r\\nRESCUE OF THE STARVING\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sufferings of Belgium during the German occupation were terrible,\\r\\nand attracted the attention and the sympathy of the whole world. To\\r\\nunderstand conditions it is necessary to know something of the economic\\r\\nsituation. Since it had come under the protection of the Great Powers,\\r\\nBelgium had developed into one of the greatest manufacturing countries\\r\\nin the world. Nearly two million of her citizens were employed in the\\r\\ngreat industries, and one million two hundred thousand on the farms. She\\r\\nwas peaceful, industrious and happy. But on account of the fact that\\r\\nmore than one-half of her citizenship earned their living by daily labor\\r\\nshe found it impossible to produce foodstuff enough for her own needs.\\r\\nSeventy-eight per cent of her breadstuffs had to be imported. From her\\r\\nown fields she could hardly supply her population for more than four\\r\\nmonths.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe war, and the German occupation, almost destroyed business. Mines,\\r\\nworkshops, factories and mills were closed. Labor found itself without\\r\\nemployment and consequently without wages. The banks would extend no\\r\\ncredit. But even if there had been money enough it soon became apparent\\r\\nthat the food supply was rapidly going. The German invasion had come\\r\\nwhen the crops were standing ripe upon the field. Those crops had not\\r\\nbeen reaped, but had been trampled under foot by the hated German.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne feature of Belgian industrial life should be understood. Hundreds of\\r\\nthousands of her workmen were employed each day in workshops at\\r\\nconsiderable distances from their own homes. In times of peace the\\r\\nmorning and evening trains were always crowded with laborers going to\\r\\nand returning from their daily toil. One of the first things seized upon\\r\\nby the German officials was the railroads, and it was with great\\r\\ndifficulty that anyone, not belonging to the German army, could obtain\\r\\nan opportunity to travel at all, and it was with still greater\\r\\ndifficulty that supplies of food of any kind could be transported from\\r\\nplace to place. Every village was cut off from its neighbor, every town\\r\\nfrom the next town. People were unable even to obtain news of the great\\r\\npolitical events which were occurring from day to day, and the food\\r\\nsupply was automatically cut off.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this was not the worst. One of the first moves of the German\\r\\noccupation was to quarter hundreds of thousands of troops upon their\\r\\nBelgian victims, and these troops must be fed even though the Belgian\\r\\nand his family were near starvation. Then followed the German seizure of\\r\\nwhat they called materials for war. General von Beseler in a despatch to\\r\\nthe Kaiser, after the fall of Antwerp, speaks very plainly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe war booty taken at Antwerp is enormous--at least five hundred cannon\\r\\nand huge quantities of ammunition, sanitation materials, high-power\\r\\nmotor cars, locomotives, wagons, four million kilograms of wheat, large\\r\\nquantities of flour, coal and flax wool, the value of which is estimated\\r\\nat ten million marks, copper, silver, one armored train, several\\r\\nhospital trains, and quantities of fish.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Germans proceeded to commandeer foodstuffs and raw materials of\\r\\nindustry. Linseed oil, oil cakes, nitrates, animal and vegetable oils,\\r\\npetroleum and mineral oils, wool, copper, rubber, ivory, cocoa, rice,\\r\\nwine, beer, all were seized and sent home to the Fatherland. Moreover,\\r\\ncities and provinces were burdened with formidable war contributions.\\r\\nBrussels was obliged to pay ten million dollars, Antwerp ten million\\r\\ndollars, the province of Brabant, ninety millions of dollars, Namur and\\r\\nseventeen surrounding communes six million four hundred thousand\\r\\ndollars. Finally Governor von Bissing, on the 10th of December, 1914,\\r\\nissued the following decree:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA war contribution of the amount of eight million dollars to be paid\\r\\nmonthly for one year is imposed upon the population of Belgium. The\\r\\npayment of these amounts is imposed upon the nine provinces which are\\r\\nregarded as joint debtors. The two first monthly payments are to be made\\r\\nby the 15th of January, 1915, at latest, and the following monthly\\r\\npayments by the tenth of each following month to the military chest of\\r\\nthe Field Army of the General Imperial Government in Brussels. If the\\r\\nprovinces are obliged to resort to the issue of stock with a view to\\r\\nprocuring the necessary funds, the form and terms of these shares will\\r\\nbe determined by the Commissary General for the banks in Belgium.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a meeting of the Provincial Councils the vice-president declared:\\r\\n\"The Germans demand these $96,000,000 of the country without right and\\r\\nwithout reason. Are we to sanction this enormous war tax? If we listened\\r\\nonly to our hearts, we should reply \\'No I ninety-six million times no!\\r\\nbecause our hearts would tell us we were a small, honest nation living\\r\\nhappily by its free labor; we were a small, honest nation having faith\\r\\nin treaties and believing in honor; we were a nation unarmed, but full\\r\\nof confidence, when Germany suddenly hurled two million men upon our\\r\\nfrontiers, the most brutal army that the world has ever seen, and said\\r\\nto us, \\'Betray the promise you have given. Let my armies go by, that I\\r\\nmay crush France, and I will give you gold.\\' Belgium replied, \\'Keep your\\r\\ngold. I prefer to die, rather than live without honor.\\' The German army\\r\\nhas, therefore, crushed our country in contempt of solemn treaties. \\'It\\r\\nis an injustice,\\' said the Chancellor of the German Empire. \\'The\\r\\nposition of Germany has forced us to commit it, but we will repair the\\r\\nwrong we have done to Belgium by the passage of our armies.\\' They want\\r\\nto repair the injustice as follows: Belgium will pay Germany\\r\\n$96,000,000! Give this proposal your vote. When Galileo had discovered\\r\\nthe fact that the earth moved around the sun, he was forced at the foot\\r\\nof the stake to abjure his error, but he murmured, \\'Nevertheless it\\r\\nmoves.\\' Well, gentlemen, as I fear a still greater misfortune for my\\r\\ncountry I consent to the payment of the $96,000,000 and I cry\\r\\n\\'Nevertheless it moves.\\' Long live our country in spite of all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of a year von Bissing renewed this assessment, inserting in\\r\\nhis decree the statement that the decree was based upon article\\r\\nforty-nine of The Hague Convention, relating to the laws and usages of\\r\\nwar on land. This article reads as follows: \"If in addition to the taxes\\r\\nmentioned in the above article the occupant levies other moneyed\\r\\ncontributions in the occupied territory, they shall only be applied to\\r\\nthe needs of the army, or of the administration, of the territory in\\r\\nquestion.\" In the preceding article it says: \"If in the territory\\r\\noccupied the occupant collects the taxes, dues and tolls payable to the\\r\\nstate, he shall do so as far as possible in accordance with the legal\\r\\nbasis and assessment in force at the time, and shall in consequence be\\r\\nbound to defray the expenses of the administration of the occupied\\r\\nterritories to the same extent as the National Government had been so\\r\\nbound.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe $96,000,000 per annum was more than six times the amount of the\\r\\ndirect taxes formerly collected by the Belgian state, taxes which the\\r\\nGerman administration, moreover, collected in addition to the war\\r\\nassessment. It was five times as great as the ordinary expenditure of\\r\\nthe Belgian War Department.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map: Denmark on the North, Elbe River on the East,\\r\\nSwitzerland on the South, Eastern England on the West.]\\r\\n  SCHLESWIG-HOLSTEIN AND ALSACE-LORRAINE ACQUISITIONS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this was not all. In addition to the more or less legitimate German\\r\\nmethods of plunder the whole country had been pillaged. In many towns\\r\\nsystematic pillage began as soon as the Germans took possession. At\\r\\nLouvain the pillage began on the 27th of August, 1914, and lasted a\\r\\nweek. In small bands the soldiers went from house to house, ransacked\\r\\ndrawers and cupboards, broke open safes, and stole money, pictures,\\r\\ncurios, silver, linen, clothing, wines, and food. Great loads of such\\r\\nplunder were packed on military baggage wagons and sent to Germany. The\\r\\nsame conditions were reported from town after town. In many cases the\\r\\nhouses were burnt to destroy the proof of extensive thefts.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor were these offenses committed only by the common soldiers. In many\\r\\ncases the officers themselves sent home great collections of plunder.\\r\\nEven the Royal Family were concerned in this disgraceful performance.\\r\\nAfter staying for a week in a chateau in the Liege District, His\\r\\nImperial Highness, Prince Eitel Fritz and the Duke of Brunswick, had all\\r\\nthe dresses which were found in a wardrobe sent back to Germany. This is\\r\\nsaid to be susceptible of absolute proof.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to this form of plunder special pretexts were made use of to\\r\\nobtain money. At Arlon a telephone wire was broken, whereupon the town\\r\\nwas given four hours to pay a fine of $20,000 in gold, in default of\\r\\nwhich one hundred houses would be sacked. When the payment was made\\r\\nforty-seven houses had already been plundered. Instance after instance\\r\\ncould be given of similar unjustifiable and exorbitant fines.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder treatment like this Belgium was brought in a short time into\\r\\nimmediate sight of starvation. They made frantic appeals for help. First\\r\\nthey appealed to the Germans, but the German authorities did nothing,\\r\\nthough in individual cases German soldiers shared their army rations\\r\\nwith the people. Then an appeal was made to Holland, but Holland was a\\r\\nnation much like Belgium. It did not raise food enough for itself, and\\r\\nwas not sure that it could import enough for its own needs.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom all over Belgium appeals were sent from the various towns and\\r\\nvillages to Brussels. But Brussels, too, was face to face with famine.\\r\\nTo cope with famine there were many relief organizations in Belgium.\\r\\nEvery little town had its relief committee, and in the larger cities\\r\\nstrong branches of the Red Cross did what they could. Besides such\\r\\nsecular organizations, there were many religious organizations,\\r\\ngenerally under the direction of the Roman Catholic Church.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Brussels a strong volunteer relief organization was formed on\\r\\nSeptember 5th under the patronage of the American and Spanish Ministers,\\r\\nMr. Brand Whitlock and the Marquis of Villalobar. This committee, known\\r\\nas the Central Relief Committee, or more exactly La Comite Central de\\r\\nSecours et d\\'Alimentation pour l\\'Agglomeration bruxelloise, did\\r\\nwonderful work until the end of the war. But though there was plenty of\\r\\norganization there were great difficulties ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to import food, credit had to be established abroad, permission\\r\\nhad to be obtained to transport food stuffs into Belgium through the\\r\\nBritish blockade. Permission to use the railroads and canals of Belgium\\r\\nhad to be obtained from Germany, and, most important of all, it had to\\r\\nbe made certain that no food thus imported should be seized by the\\r\\nGerman troops.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough the American and Spanish ministers permission was obtained from\\r\\nGovernor-General Kolmar von der Goltz to import food, and the\\r\\nGovernor-General also gave assurance that, \"Foodstuffs of all sorts\\r\\nimported by the committee to assist the civil population shall be\\r\\nreserved exclusively for the nourishment of the civil population of\\r\\nBelgium, and that consequently these foodstuffs shall be exempt from\\r\\nrequisition on the part of the military authorities, and shall rest\\r\\nexclusively at the disposition of the committee.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this assurance the Central Relief Committee sent Emil Francqui and\\r\\nBaron Lambert, members of their committee, together with Mr. Hugh\\r\\nGibson, secretary of the American Legation, whose activities in behalf\\r\\nof Belgium attracted much favorable notice, to the city of London, to\\r\\nexplain to the British Government the suffering that existed in Belgium,\\r\\nand to obtain permission to transport food through the British blockade.\\r\\nIn the course of this work they appealed to the American Ambassador in\\r\\nEngland, Mr. Walter Hines Page, and were introduced by him to an\\r\\nAmerican mining engineer named Herbert Clark Hoover, who had just become\\r\\nprominent as the chairman of a committee to assist Americans who had\\r\\nfound themselves in Europe when the war broke out, and had been unable\\r\\nto secure funds.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Hoover took up the matter with great vigor, and organized an\\r\\nAmerican committee under the patronage of the ministers of the United\\r\\nStates and of Spain in London, Berlin, The Hague and Brussels, which\\r\\ncommittee obtained permission from the British Government to purchase\\r\\nand transport through the British blockade, to Rotterdam, Holland,\\r\\ncargoes of foodstuffs, to be ultimately transferred into Belgium and\\r\\ndistributed by the Belgian Central Relief Committee under the direction\\r\\nof American citizens headed by Mr. Brand Whitlock.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Painting: Several ships and two airplanes.]\\r\\n  AN AIRPLANE CONVOY\\r\\n  Food ships successfully convoyed by seaplanes in clear weather when\\r\\n  submarines were easier to detect.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n188  HISTORY OF THE WORLD WAR\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Painting]\\r\\n  BRITISH LIGHT ARTILLERY GETTING IN ON THE GALLOP\\r\\n  Always the guns must follow closely in the wake of the infantry to\\r\\n  break up German counter attacks and hold the ground gained. Here a\\r\\n  detachment of the Royal Horse Artillery storms through a deserted\\r\\n  Flanders village, straining every nerve to save those few seconds that\\r\\n  may mean the saving or the loss of the new positions won.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following brief notices, in connection with this committee appeared\\r\\nin the London Times:\\r\\n\\r\\nOctober 24 1914.--A commission has been set up in London, under the\\r\\ntitle of The American Commission for Relief in Belgium. The Brussels\\r\\ncommittee reports feeding 300,000 daily.\\r\\n\\r\\nNovember 4.--The Commission for Relief in Belgium yesterday issued their\\r\\nfirst weekly report, 3 London Wall Buildings. A cargo was received\\r\\nyesterday at Brussels just in time. Estimated monthly requirements,\\r\\n60,000 tons grain, 15,000 tons maize, 3,000 tons rice and peas. Approved\\r\\nby the Spanish and American ministers, Brussels.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe personality of the various gentlemen who devoted themselves to\\r\\nBelgian relief is interesting, not only because of what they did, but\\r\\nbecause they are unusual men. The Spanish Minister, who bore the\\r\\npeculiar name of Marquis of Villalobar y O\\'Neill, had the appearance of\\r\\nan Irishman, as he was on the maternal side, and was a trained diplomat,\\r\\nwith delightful manners and extraordinary strength of character. Another\\r\\nimportant aid in the Belgian relief work was the Mexican Charge\\r\\nd\\'Affaires Senor don German Bulle. Hugh Gibson, secretary of the\\r\\nAmerican Legation, wittily described this gentleman as the\\r\\n\"representative of a country without a government to a government\\r\\nwithout a country.\" The businessman in the American Legation was this\\r\\nsecretary. Mr. Gibson had the appearance of a typical Yankee, though he\\r\\ncame from Indiana. He was about thirty years old, with dark eyes, crisp\\r\\nhair, and a keen face. He was noted for his wit as well as his courage.\\r\\nMany interesting stories are told of him. He had been often under fire,\\r\\nand he was full of stories of his exploits told in a witty and modest\\r\\nway.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following incident shows something of his humor. Like most of the\\r\\nAmericans in Belgium he was followed by spies. With one of these Gibson\\r\\nbecame on the most familiar terms, much to the spy\\'s disgust. One very\\r\\nrainy day, when Gibson was at the Legation, he discovered his pet spy\\r\\nstanding under the dripping eaves of a neighboring house. Gibson picked\\r\\nup a raincoat and hurried over to the man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look here, old fellow,\" said he, \"I\\'m going to be in the Legation for\\r\\nthree hours. You put on this coat and go home. Come back in three hours\\r\\nand I\\'ll let you watch me for the rest of the day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Brand Whitlock, the American Minister, was a remarkable man. Before\\r\\ncoming to Belgium he had become a distinguished man of letters.\\r\\nBeginning as a newspaper reporter in Chicago, he had studied law and\\r\\nbeen admitted to the Illinois Bar in 1894, and to the Bar of the State\\r\\nof Ohio in 1897. He had entered into politics, and been elected mayor of\\r\\nToledo, Ohio, in 1905, again in 1907, 1909 and 1911. Meanwhile he had\\r\\nbeen writing novels, \"The Thirteenth District,\" \"The Turn of the\\r\\nBalance,\" \"The Fall Guy,\" and \"Forty Years of It.\" He had accepted the\\r\\nappointment of American Minister to Belgium with the idea that he would\\r\\nfind leisure for other literary work, but the outbreak of the war\\r\\naffected him deeply. A man of a sympathetic character who had lived all\\r\\nhis life in an amiable atmosphere, had been a member of prison reform\\r\\nassociations and charitable societies, he now found himself surrounded\\r\\nby a storm of horrors. Day by day he had to see the distress and\\r\\nsuffering of thousands of people. He threw himself at once into the work\\r\\nof relief. His health was not strong and he always looked tired and\\r\\nworn. He was the scholarly type of man, the kind who would be happy in a\\r\\nlibrary, or in the atmosphere of a college, but he rose to the\\r\\nemergency.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American Legation became the one staple point around which the\\r\\nstarving and suffering population could rally. Belgians will never\\r\\nforget what he did in those days. On Washington\\'s Birthday they filed\\r\\nbefore the door of the American Legation at Number 74 Rue de Treves,\\r\\nmen, women and children of all classes; some in furs, some in the\\r\\ngarments of the poor; noblemen, scholars, workmen, artists, shopkeepers\\r\\nand peasants to leave their visiting cards, some engraved, some printed\\r\\nand some written on pieces of paper, in tribute to Mr. Whitlock and the\\r\\nnation which he represented.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the man whose name stands cut above all others as one of the biggest\\r\\nfigures in connection with the work of relief was Mr. Herbert C. Hoover.\\r\\nMr. Hoover came of Quaker stock. He was born at West Branch, Iowa, in\\r\\n1874, graduated from Leland Stanford University in 1895, specialized in\\r\\nmining engineering, and spent several years in mining in the United\\r\\nStates and in Australia. He married Miss Lou Henry, of Monterey,\\r\\nCalifornia, in 1899, and with his bride went to China as chief engineer\\r\\nof the Chinese Imperial Bureau of Mines. He aided in the defense of\\r\\nTientsin during the Boxer Rebellion. After that he continued engineering\\r\\nwork in China until 1902, when he became a partner of the firm of\\r\\nBewick, Moreing & Co., mine operators, of London, and was consulting\\r\\nengineer for more than fifty mining companies. He looked extremely\\r\\nyouthful; smooth shaven, with a straight nose, and a strong mouth and\\r\\nchin. To him, more than anyone else, was due the creation and the\\r\\nsuccess of the Commission for Relief in Belgium. The splendid\\r\\norganization which saved from so much suffering more than seven million\\r\\nnon-combatants in Belgium and two million in Northern France, was his\\r\\nachievement.\\r\\n\\r\\nA good story is told in the Outlook of September 8, 1915, which\\r\\nillustrates his methods. It seems that before the commission was fairly\\r\\non its feet, there came a day when it was a case of snarling things in\\r\\nred tape and letting Belgium starve, or getting food shipped and letting\\r\\ngovernments howl. Hoover naturally chose the latter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the last bag had been stowed and the hatches were battened down\\r\\n(writes Mr. Lewis R. Freeman, who tells the story), Hoover went in\\r\\nperson to the one Cabinet Minister able to arrange for the only things\\r\\nhe could not provide for himself--clearance papers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I do not get four cargoes of food to Belgium by the end of the\\r\\nweek,\" he said bluntly, \"thousands are going to die from starvation, and\\r\\nmany more may be shot in food riots.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Out of the question,\" said the distinguished Minister; \"there is no\\r\\ntime, in the first place, and if there was, there are no good wagons to\\r\\nbe spared by the railways, no dock hands, and no steamers. Moreover, the\\r\\nChannel is closed for a week to merchant vessels, while troops are being\\r\\ntransferred to the Continent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have managed to get all these things,\" Hoover replied quietly, \"and\\r\\nam now through with them all, except the steamers. This wire tells me\\r\\nthat these are now loaded and ready to sail, and I have come to have you\\r\\narrange for their clearance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great man gasped. \"There have been--there are even now--men in the\\r\\nTower for less than you have done!\" he ejaculated. \"If it was for\\r\\nanything but Belgium Relief--if it was anybody but you, young man--I\\r\\nshould hate to think of what might happen. As it is--er--I suppose\\r\\nthere is nothing to do but congratulate you on a jolly clever coup. I\\'ll\\r\\nsee about the clearance at once.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Lloyd George tells the following story: It seems that the Commission\\r\\non Belgian Relief was attempting to simplify its work by arranging for\\r\\nan extension of exchange facilities on Brussels. Mr. Lloyd George, then\\r\\nChancellor of the Exchequer, sent for Hoover. What happened is told in\\r\\nMr. George\\'s words:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Mr. Hoover,\\' I said, \\'I find I am quite unable to grant your request\\r\\nin the matter of Belgian exchange, and I have asked you to come here\\r\\nthat I might explain why.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Without waiting for me to go on, my boyish-looking caller began\\r\\nspeaking. For fifteen minutes he spoke without a break--just about the\\r\\nclearest expository utterance I have ever heard on any subject. He used\\r\\nnot a word too much, nor yet a word too few. By the time he had finished\\r\\nI had come to realize, not only the importance of his contentions, but,\\r\\nwhat was more to the point, the practicability of granting his request.\\r\\nSo I did the only thing possible under the circumstance, told him I had\\r\\nnever understood the question before, thanked him for helping me to\\r\\nunderstand, and saw to it that things were arranged as he wanted them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 10, 1915, a submarine torpedoed one of the food ships chartered\\r\\nby the commission. A week later a German hydro-airplane tried to drop\\r\\nbombs on the deck of another commission ship. So Hoover paid a flying\\r\\nvisit to Berlin. He was at once assured that no more incidents of the\\r\\nsort would occur.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thanks,\" said Hoover. \"Your Excellency, have you heard the story of the\\r\\nman who was nipped by a bad-tempered dog? He went to the owner to have\\r\\nthe dog muzzled. \\'But the dog won\\'t bite you,\\' insisted the owner. \\'You\\r\\nknow he won\\'t bite me, and I know he won\\'t bite me,\\' said the injured\\r\\nparty doubtfully, \\'but the question is, does the dog know?\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Herr Hoover,\" said the high official, \"pardon me if I leave you for a\\r\\nmoment. I am going at once to \\'let the dog know.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis story, which is told by Mr. Edward Eyre Hunt in his delightful book\\r\\nabout Belgium, \"War Bread,\" may be apocryphal, but it illustrates well\\r\\nHoover\\'s habit of getting exactly what he wants.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mr. Hoover accepted the chairmanship of the Commission for Relief\\r\\nin Belgium he established his headquarters at 3 London Wall Buildings,\\r\\nLondon, England, and marshaled a small legion of fellow Americans,\\r\\nbusiness men, sanitary experts, doctors and social workers, who, as\\r\\nunpaid volunteers, set about the great task of feeding the people of\\r\\nBelgium and Northern France. The commission soon became a great\\r\\ninstitution, recognized by all governments, receiving contributions from\\r\\nall parts of the earth, with its own ships in every big port, and in the\\r\\neyes of the Belgians and French, who received their daily bread through\\r\\nits agency, a monument of what Americans could do in social organization\\r\\nand business efficiency, for Americans furnished the entire personnel of\\r\\nthe commission from the beginning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe commission was a distinct organization from the Belgian National\\r\\nCommittee, through and with which it worked in Belgium itself. Its\\r\\nfunctions were those of direction, and supervision of all matters that\\r\\nhad to be dealt with outside Belgium. In the occupied territories it had\\r\\nthe help of thousands of Belgian and French workers, many of them women.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe commission did not depend, according to Mr. Hoover, on anyone of its\\r\\nAmerican members for leadership. Anyone of them could at any time take\\r\\ncharge and carry on the work. \"Honold, Poland, Gregory, Brown, Kellogg,\\r\\nLucey, White, Hunsiker, Connet, and many others who, at various periods,\\r\\nhave given of their great ability and experience in administration could\\r\\ndo it.\" At the same time it was admitted that the commission would never\\r\\nhave been so successful if Belgium had not already had in existence a\\r\\nwell-developed communal system. The base of the commission\\'s\\r\\norganization was a committee in every commune or municipality.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can have no idea what a great blessing it was in Belgium and\\r\\nNorthern France to have the small and intimate divisions which exist\\r\\nunder the communal system,\" said Mr. Hoover. \"It is the whole unit of\\r\\nlife, and a political entity much more developed than in America. It has\\r\\nbeen not only the basis of our relief organization, but the salvation of\\r\\nthe people.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAltogether there were four thousand communal committees linked up in\\r\\nlarger groups under district and provincial committees, which in turn\\r\\ncame under the Belgian National Committee. Contributions were received\\r\\nfrom all over the world, but the greater part from the British and\\r\\nFrench governments.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mr. Hoover began his work he appealed to the people of the United\\r\\nStates, but the American response to the appeal was sadly disappointing.\\r\\nDuring his stay in America, in the early part of 1917, Mr. Hoover\\r\\nexpressed himself on the subject of his own country\\'s niggardliness,\\r\\npointing out at the same time that the chief profits made out of\\r\\nproviding food for Belgium had gone into American pockets. Out of the\\r\\ntwo hundred and fifty millions of dollars spent by the commission at\\r\\nthat time, one hundred and fifty millions had been used in the United\\r\\nStates to purchase supplies and on these orders America had made a war\\r\\nprofit of at least thirty million dollars. Yet in those two years the\\r\\nAmerican people had contributed only nine million dollars!\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Hoover declared: \"Thousands of contributions have come to us from\\r\\ndevoted people all over the United States, but the truth is that, with\\r\\nthe exception of a few large gifts, American contributions have been\\r\\nlittle rills of charity of the poor toward the poor. Everywhere abroad\\r\\nAmerica has been getting the credit for keeping alight the lamp of\\r\\nhumanity, but what are the facts? America\\'s contributions have been\\r\\npitifully inadequate and, do not forget it, other peoples have begun to\\r\\ntake stock of us. We have been getting all the credit. Have we deserved\\r\\nit? We lay claim to idealism, to devotion to duty and to great\\r\\nbenevolence, but now the acid test is being applied to us. This has a\\r\\nwider import than mere figures. Time and time again, when the door to\\r\\nBelgium threatened to close, we have defended its portals by the\\r\\nassertion that this was an American enterprise; that the sensibilities\\r\\nof the American people would be wounded beyond measure, would be\\r\\noutraged, if this work were interfered with. Our moral strength has been\\r\\nbased upon this assertion. I believe it is true, but it is difficult in\\r\\nthe face of the figures to carry conviction. And in the last six or\\r\\neight months time and again we have felt our influence slip from under\\r\\nus.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe statement that Germans had taken food intended for the Belgians was\\r\\ndisposed of by Mr. Hoover in a speech in New York City. \"We are\\r\\nsatisfied,\" he said, \"that the German army has never eaten one-tenth of\\r\\none per cent of the food provided. The Allied governments never would\\r\\nhave supplied us with two hundred million dollars if we were supplying\\r\\nthe German army. If the Germans had absorbed any considerable quantity\\r\\nof this food the population of Belgium would not be alive today.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plan of operation of the Belgian Commission needs some description.\\r\\nBesides the headquarters in London there was an office in Brussels, and,\\r\\nas Rotterdam was the port of entry for all Belgian supplies, a\\r\\ntransshipping office for commission goods was opened in that city. The\\r\\noffice building was at 98 Haringvliet, formerly the residence of a Dutch\\r\\nmerchant prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain J. F. Lucey, the first Rotterdam director, sat in a roomy office\\r\\non the second floor overlooking the Meuse. From his windows he could see\\r\\nthe commission barges as they left for Belgium, their huge canvas flags\\r\\nbearing the inscription \"Belgian Relief Committee.\" He was a nervous,\\r\\nbig, beardless American, a volunteer who had left his business to\\r\\norganize and direct a great transshipping office in an alien land for an\\r\\nalien people.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of nothing he created a large staff of clerks, wrung from the Dutch\\r\\nGovernment special permits, loaded the immense cargoes received from\\r\\nEngland into canal boats, obtained passports for cargoes and crews, and\\r\\nshipped the foodstuffs consigned personally to Mr. Brand Whitlock.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething of what was done at this point may be understood from a\\r\\nreference in the first annual report of the commission published October\\r\\n31, 1915:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chartering and management of an entire fleet of vessels, together\\r\\nwith agency control practically throughout the world, has been carried\\r\\nout for the commission quite free of the usual charges by large\\r\\ntransportation firms who offered these concessions in the cause of\\r\\nhumanity. Banks generally have given their exchange services and have\\r\\npaid the full rate of interest on deposits. Insurance has been\\r\\nfacilitated by the British Government Insurance Commissioners, and the\\r\\nfirms who fixed the insurance have subscribed the equivalent of their\\r\\nfees. Harbor dues and port charges have been remitted at many points and\\r\\nstevedoring firms have made important concessions in rates and have\\r\\nafforded other generous services. In Holland, exemption from harbor dues\\r\\nand telegraph tolls has been granted and rail transport into Belgium\\r\\nprovided free of charge. The total value of these Dutch concessions is\\r\\nestimated at 147,824 guilders. The German military authorities in\\r\\nBelgium have abolished custom and canal dues on all commission imports,\\r\\nhave reduced railway rates one-half and on canals and railways they give\\r\\nright of way to commission foodstuffs wherever there is need.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy mid-November gift ships from the United States were on their way to\\r\\nRotterdam, but the Canadian province of Nova Scotia was first in the\\r\\ntransatlantic race.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most thrilling experiences of the first year\\'s work was the\\r\\ncoming of the Christmas ship, a steamer full of Christmas gifts\\r\\npresented by the children of America to the children of war-ridden\\r\\nBelgium. The children knew all about it long before the ship arrived in\\r\\nRotterdam. St. Nicholas\\' day had brought them few presents. They were\\r\\nhungry for friendliness, and the thought of getting gifts from children\\r\\nacross the sea filled them with joy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany difficulties arose, which delayed the distribution of these gifts.\\r\\nThe Germans insisted that every package should be opened and every scrap\\r\\nof writing taken out before the gifts were sent into Belgium. This was a\\r\\ntremendous task, for notes written by American children were tucked away\\r\\ninto all sorts of impossible places.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree motor boats made an attempt to carry these gifts into Belgium by\\r\\nChristmas day. They carried boxes of clothing, outfits for babies,\\r\\nblankets, caps, bonnets, cloaks, shoes of every description, babies\\'\\r\\nboots, candy, fish, striped candy canes, chocolates and mountains of\\r\\nnuts, nuts such as the Belgians had never seen in their lives before:\\r\\npecans, hickory nuts, American walnuts, and peanuts galore. There were\\r\\nscores of dolls, French bisques, smiling pleasantly, pop-eyed rag dolls,\\r\\nold darky mammy dolls, and Santa Clauses, teddy bears, picture books,\\r\\nfairy books and story books.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne child had written on the cover of her book: \"Father says I ought to\\r\\nsend you my best picture book, but I think that this one will do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese gifts made the American aid to Belgium a thousand times more\\r\\nintimate and real, and never after that was American help thought of in\\r\\nother terms than those of burning gratitude. Among these gifts were\\r\\nhundreds of American flags, which soon became familiar to all Belgium.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe commission automobiles bore the flag, and the children would\\r\\nrecognize the Stars and Stripes and wave and cheer as it went by.\\r\\nThousands upon thousands of gifts to the Belgian people followed the\\r\\nChristmas ship. All, or a great part, of the cargoes of one hundred and\\r\\ntwo ships consisted of gift goods from America and indeed from all parts\\r\\nof the world, and the Belgians sent back a flood of acknowledgments and\\r\\nthousands of beautiful souvenirs. Some of the most touching remembrances\\r\\ncame from the children. Every child in the town of Tamise, for example,\\r\\nwrote a letter to America.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne addressed to the President of the United States reads as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHighly Honored Mr. President: Although I am still very young I feel\\r\\nalready that feeling of thankfulness which we, as Belgians, owe to you,\\r\\nHighly Honored Mr. President, because you have come to our help in these\\r\\ndreary times. Without your help there would certainly have been\\r\\nthousands of war victims, and so, Noble Sir, I pray that God will bless\\r\\nyou and all the noble American people. That is the wish of all the\\r\\nBelgian folk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn New Year\\'s day Cardinal Mercier, Archbishop of Malines, issued his\\r\\nfamous pastoral:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBelgium gave her word of honor to defend her independence. She has kept\\r\\nher word. The other powers had agreed to protect and to respect\\r\\nBelgium\\'s neutrality. Germany has broken her word, England has been\\r\\nfaithful to it. These are the facts. I consider it an obligation of my\\r\\npastoral charge to define to you your conscientious duties toward the\\r\\npower which has invaded our soil, and which for the moment occupies the\\r\\ngreater part of it. This power has no authority, and, therefore, in the\\r\\ndepth of your heart, you should render it neither esteem, nor\\r\\nattachment, nor respect. The only legitimate power in Belgium is that\\r\\nwhich belongs to our King, to his government, to the representatives of\\r\\nthe nation; that alone is authority for us; that alone has a right to\\r\\nour heart\\'s affection and to our submission.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCardinal Mercier was called the bravest man in Belgium. Six feet five in\\r\\nheight, a thin, scholarly face, with grayish white hair, and a forehead\\r\\nso white that one feels one looks on the naked bone, he presented the\\r\\nappearance of some medieval ascetic. But there was a humorous look about\\r\\nhis mouth, and an expression of sympathy and comprehension which gave\\r\\nthe effect of a keenly intelligent, as well as gentle, leader of the\\r\\nnation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the beginning of the war the Roman Catholic party was divided. Some\\r\\nof its leaders were opposed to resistance to the invaders. Many priests\\r\\nfled before the German armies. But the pastoral letter of Cardinal\\r\\nMercier restored to the Church its old leadership. In him conquered\\r\\nBelgium had found a voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn New Year\\'s Sunday, 1915, every priest at the Mass read out the\\r\\nCardinal\\'s ringing challenge. There were German soldiers in the\\r\\nchurches, but no word of the letter had been allowed to reach the ears\\r\\nof the authorities, and the Germans were taken completely by surprise.\\r\\nImmediately orders came from headquarters prohibiting further\\r\\ncirculation of the letter, and ordering that every copy should be\\r\\nsurrendered to the authorities. Soldiers at the bayonet\\'s point extorted\\r\\nthe letter from the priests, and those who had read it were put under\\r\\narrest. Yet, somehow, copies of the letter were circulated throughout\\r\\nBelgium, and every Belgian took new heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs far as the Cardinal was concerned German action was a very delicate\\r\\nmatter. They could not arrest and imprison so great a dignitary of the\\r\\nChurch for fear of the effect, not only upon the Catholics of the outer\\r\\nworld, but on the Catholics in their own empire. An officer was sent to\\r\\nthe Cardinal to demand that the letter be recalled. The Cardinal\\r\\nrefused. He was then notified that it was desired that he remain in his\\r\\npalace for the present. His confinement lasted only for a day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Americans who were in Belgium as representatives of the Relief\\r\\nCommission had two duties. First, to see that the Germans did not seize\\r\\nany of the food supplies, and second, to see that every Belgian who was\\r\\nin need should receive his daily bread. The ration assigned to each\\r\\nBelgian was 250 grams of bread per day. This seems rather small, but the\\r\\nfigure was established by Horace Fletcher, the American food expert, who\\r\\nwas one of the members of the commission.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Fletcher also prepared a pamphlet on food values, which gave recipes\\r\\nfor American dishes which were up to that time unknown to the Belgians.\\r\\nHe soon got not only the American but the Belgian committeemen talking\\r\\nof calories with great familiarity.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the foods sent from America were at first almost useless to the\\r\\nBelgians. They did not know how to cook cornmeal and oatmeal, and some\\r\\nof the famished peasants used them as feed for chickens. Teachers had to\\r\\nbe sent out through the villages to give instructions.\\r\\n\\r\\nA great deal of difficulty developed in connection with the bread. The\\r\\nsupply of white flour was limited; wheat had to be imported, and milled\\r\\nin Belgium. It was milled so as to contain all the bran except ten per\\r\\ncent, but in some places ten or fifteen per cent of cornmeal was added\\r\\nto the flour, not only to enable the commission to provide the necessary\\r\\nration, but also to keep down the price. As a result the price of bread\\r\\nwas always lower in Belgium than in London, Paris or New York.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch less trouble occurred in connection with the distribution of bread\\r\\nand soup from the soup kitchens. In Antwerp thirty-five thousand men\\r\\nwere fed daily at these places. At first it often occurred that soup\\r\\ncould be had, but no bread. The ration of soup and bread given in the\\r\\nkitchens cost about ten cents a day. There were four varieties of soup,\\r\\npea, bean, vegetable and bouillon, and it was of excellent quality.\\r\\nEvery person carried a card with blank spaces for the date of the\\r\\ndeliveries of soup. There were several milk kitchens maintained for the\\r\\nchildren, and several restaurants where persons with money might obtain\\r\\ntheir food.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was necessary not only to fight starvation in Belgium but also\\r\\ndisease. There were epidemics of typhoid and black measles. The\\r\\nRockefeller Foundation established a station in Rotterdam called the\\r\\nRockefeller Foundation War Relief Commission, and some of the women\\r\\namong its workers acted as volunteer health officers. People were\\r\\ninoculated against typhoid, and the sources of infection traced and\\r\\ndestroyed. Another form of relief work was providing labor for the\\r\\nunemployed. A plan of relief was drawn up and it was arranged that a\\r\\nlarge portion of them should be employed by the communal organizations,\\r\\nin public works, such as draining, ditching, constructing embankments\\r\\nand building sewers. The National Committee paid nine-tenths of the\\r\\nwages, the commune paying the other tenth. The first enrolment of\\r\\nunemployed amounted to more than 760,000 names, and nearly as many\\r\\npersons were dependent upon these workers.\\r\\n\\r\\nProviding employment for these led to certain complications. The Germans\\r\\nhad been able up to this time to secure a certain amount of labor from\\r\\nthe Belgians. Now the Belgian could refuse to work for the German, and a\\r\\ngreat deal of tact was necessary to prevent trouble. As time went on the\\r\\nrelief work of the Commission was extended into the north of France,\\r\\nwhere a population of more than 2,000,000 was within the German zone.\\r\\nThe work was handled in the same way, with the same guarantees from\\r\\nGermany.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion a word may be said of the effect of all this suffering\\r\\nupon the Belgian people, and let a Belgian speak, who knew his country\\r\\nwell and had traveled it over, going on foot, as he says, or by tram,\\r\\nfrom town to town, from village to village:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have seen and spoken with hundreds of men of all classes and all\\r\\nparts of the country, and all these people, taken singly or united in\\r\\ngroups, display a very definite frame of mind. To describe this new\\r\\npsychology we must record the incontestably closer union which has been\\r\\nformed between the political sections of the country. There are no\\r\\nlonger any political parties, there are Belgians in Belgium, and that is\\r\\nall; Belgians better acquainted with their country, feeling for it an\\r\\nimpulse of passionate tenderness such as a child might feel who saw his\\r\\nmother suffering for the first time, and on his account. Walloons and\\r\\nFlemings, Catholics and Liberals or Socialists, all are more and more\\r\\nfrankly united in all that concerns the national life and decisions for\\r\\nthe future.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By uniting the whole nation and its army, by shedding the blood of all\\r\\nour Belgians in every corner of the country, by forcing all hearts, all\\r\\nfamilies, to follow with anguish the movement of those soldiers who\\r\\nfought from Liege to Namur, from Wavre to Antwerp or the Oise, the war\\r\\nhas suddenly imposed wider horizons upon all, has inspired all minds\\r\\nwith noble and ardent passions, has compelled the good will of all to\\r\\ncombine and act in concert in order to defend the common interests.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of these profoundly tried minds, of these wonderful energies now\\r\\nemployed for the first time, of these atrocious sufferings which have\\r\\nbrought all hearts into closer contact, a new Belgium is born, a\\r\\ngreater, more generous, more ideal Belgium.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIII\\r\\n\\r\\nBRITANNIA RULES THE WAVES\\r\\n\\r\\nThe month of October, 1914, contained no important naval contests. On\\r\\nthe 15th, the old British cruiser Hawke was torpedoed in the North Sea\\r\\nand nearly five hundred men were lost. On the other hand, on the 17th of\\r\\nOctober, the light cruiser Undaunted, accompanied by the destroyers,\\r\\nLance, Legion and Loyal, sank four German destroyers off the Dutch\\r\\ncoast. But the opening of November turned the interest of the navy to\\r\\nthe Southern Pacific. When the war began Admiral von Spee, with the\\r\\nGerman Pacific squadron, was at Kiaochau in command of seven vessels.\\r\\nAmong these was the Emden, whose adventurous career has been already\\r\\ndescribed. Another, the Karlsruhe, became a privateer in the South\\r\\nAtlantic.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in August von Spee set sail from Kiaochau with two armored\\r\\ncruisers, the Gneisenau and the Scharnhorst and three light cruisers,\\r\\nthe Dresden, Leipzig and Nurmberg. These ships were comparatively new,\\r\\nwell armed, and of considerable speed. They set off for the great trade\\r\\nhighways to destroy, as far as possible, British commerce. Their route\\r\\nled them to the western coast of South America, and arrangements were\\r\\nmade so that they were coaled and provisioned from bases in some of the\\r\\nSouth American states which permitted a slack observance of the laws\\r\\nrespecting the duties of neutrals.\\r\\n\\r\\nA small British squadron had been detailed to protect British commerce\\r\\nin this part of the world. It was commanded by Rear Admiral Sir\\r\\nChristopher Cradock, a distinguished and popular sailor, who had under\\r\\nhis command one twelve-year-old battleship, the Canopus, two armored\\r\\ncruisers, the Good Hope and the Monmouth, the light cruiser Glasgow, and\\r\\nan armed liner, the Otranto. None of these vessels had either great\\r\\nspeed or heavy armament. The equipment of the Canopus, indeed, was\\r\\nobsolete. Admiral Cradock\\'s squadron arrived at Halifax on August 14th,\\r\\nthence sailed to Bermuda, then on past Venezuela and Brazil around the\\r\\nHorn. It visited the Falkland Islands, and by the third week of October\\r\\nwas on the coast of Chile. The Canopus had dropped behind for repairs,\\r\\nand though reinforcements were expected, they had not yet arrived.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne officer wrote, on the 12th of October, \"From now till the end of the\\r\\nmonth is the critical time, as it will decide whether we shall have to\\r\\nfight a superior German force from the Pacific before we can get\\r\\nreinforcements from home or the Mediterranean. We feel that the\\r\\nadmiralty ought to have a better force here, but we shall fight\\r\\ncheerfully whatever odds we have to face.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmiral Cradock knew well that his enemy was superior in force. From\\r\\nCoronel, where he sent off some cables, he went north on the first of\\r\\nNovember, and about four o\\'clock in the afternoon the Glasgow sighted\\r\\nthe enemy. The two big German armored cruisers were leading the way, and\\r\\ntwo light cruisers were following close. The German cruiser Leipzig does\\r\\nnot seem to have been in company. The British squadron was led by the\\r\\nGood Hope, with the Monmouth, Glasgow and Otranto following in order. It\\r\\nwas a beautiful spectacle. The sun was setting in the wonderful glory\\r\\nwhich one sees in the Pacific, and the British ships, west of the\\r\\nGerman, must have appeared to them in brilliant colors. On the east were\\r\\nthe snowy peaks of the Andes. Half a gale was blowing and the two\\r\\nsquadrons moved south at great speed. About seven o\\'clock they were\\r\\nabout seven miles apart and the Scharnhorst, which was leading the\\r\\nGerman fleet, opened fire. At this time the Germans were shaded by the\\r\\ninshore twilight, but the British ships must have showed up plainly in\\r\\nthe afterglow. The enemy fired with great accuracy. Shell after shell\\r\\nhit the Good Hope and the Monmouth, but the bad light and inferior guns\\r\\nsaved the German ships from much damage. The Good Hope was set on fire\\r\\nand at 7.50 exploded and sank. The Monmouth was also on fire, and turned\\r\\naway to the western sea. The Glasgow had escaped so far, but the whole\\r\\nGerman squadron bore down upon her. She turned and fled and by nine\\r\\no\\'clock was out of sight of the enemy. The Otranto, only an armed liner,\\r\\nhad disappeared early in the fight. On the following day the Glasgow\\r\\nworked around to the south, and joined the Canopus, and the two\\r\\nproceeded to the Straits of the Magellan. The account of this battle by\\r\\nthe German Admiral von Spee is of especial interest:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wind and swell were head on, and the vessels had heavy going,\\r\\nespecially the small cruisers on both sides. Observation and distance\\r\\nestimation were under a severe handicap because of the seas which washed\\r\\nover the bridges. The swell was so great that it obscured the aim of the\\r\\ngunners at the six-inch guns on the middle deck, who could not see the\\r\\nsterns of the enemy ships at all, and the bows but seldom. At 6.20 P.\\r\\nM., at a distance of 13,400 yards, I turned one point toward the enemy,\\r\\nand at 6.34 opened fire at a distance of 11,260 yards. The guns of both\\r\\nour armored cruisers were effective, and at 6.39 already we could note\\r\\nthe first hit on the Good Hope. I at once resumed a parallel course,\\r\\ninstead of bearing slightly toward the enemy. The English opened their\\r\\nfire at this time. I assume that the heavy sea made more trouble for\\r\\nthem than it did for us. Their two armored cruisers remained covered by\\r\\nour fire, while they, so far as could be determined, hit the Scharnhorst\\r\\nbut twice, and the Gneisenau only four times. At 6.53, when 6,500 yards\\r\\napart, I ordered a course one point away from the enemy. They were\\r\\nfiring more slowly at this time, while we were able to count numerous\\r\\nhits. We could see, among other things, that the top of the Monmouth\\'s\\r\\nforward turret had been shot away, and that a violent fire was burning\\r\\nin the turret. The Scharnhorst, it is thought, hit the Good Hope about\\r\\nthirty-five times. In spite of our altered course the English changed\\r\\ntheirs sufficiently so that the distance between us shrunk to 5,300\\r\\nyards. There was reason to suspect that the enemy despaired of using his\\r\\nartillery effectively, and was maneuvering for a torpedo attack.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The position of the moon, which had risen at six o\\'clock, was favorable\\r\\nto this move. Accordingly I gradually opened up further distances\\r\\nbetween the squadrons by another deflection of the leading ship, at\\r\\n7.45. In the meantime it had grown dark. The range finders on the\\r\\nScharnhorst used the fire on the Monmouth as a guide for a time, though\\r\\neventually all range finding, aiming and observations became so inexact\\r\\nthat fire was stopped at 7.26. At 7.23 a column of fire from an\\r\\nexplosion was noticed between the stacks of the Good Hope. The Monmouth\\r\\napparently stopped firing at 7.20. The small cruisers, including the\\r\\nNuremburg, received by wireless at 7.30 the order to follow the enemy\\r\\nand to attack his ships with torpedoes. Vision was somewhat obscured at\\r\\nthis time by a rain squall. The light cruisers were not able to find the\\r\\nGood Hope, but the Nuremburg encountered the Monmouth and at 8.58 was\\r\\nable, by shots at closest range, to capsize her, without a single shot\\r\\nbeing fired in return. Rescue work in the heavy sea was not to be\\r\\nthought of, especially as the Nuremburg immediately afterward believed\\r\\nshe had sighted the smoke of another ship and had to prepare for another\\r\\nattack. The small cruisers had neither losses nor damage in the battle.\\r\\nOn the Gneisenau there were two men slightly wounded. The crews of the\\r\\nships went into the fight with enthusiasm, everyone did his duty, and\\r\\nplayed his part in the victory.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle criticism can be made of the tactics used by Vice-Admiral Spee.\\r\\nHe appears to have maneuvered so as to secure the advantage of light,\\r\\nwind and sea. He also seems to have suited himself as regards the range.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmiral Cradock was much criticised for joining battle with his little\\r\\nfleet against such odds, but he followed the glorious traditions of the\\r\\nEnglish navy. He, and 1,650 officers and men, were lost, and the news\\r\\nwas hailed as a great German victory. But the British admiralty were\\r\\nthoroughly roused. Rear-Admiral Sir Frederick Doveton Sturdee, chief of\\r\\nthe war staff, proceeded at once with a squadron to the South Atlantic.\\r\\nWith him were two battle cruisers, the Invincible and the Inflexible,\\r\\nthree armored cruisers, the Carnovan, the Kent and the Cornwall. His\\r\\nfleet was joined by the light cruiser Bristol and the armed liner\\r\\nMacedonia. The Glasgow, fresh from her rough experience, was found in\\r\\nthe South Atlantic. Admiral Sturdee then laid his plans to come in touch\\r\\nwith the victorious German squadron. A wireless message was sent to the\\r\\nCanopus, bidding her proceed to Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands.\\r\\nThis message was intercepted by the Germans, as was intended.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph]\\r\\n  Copyright International News Service\\r\\n  THE SINKING OF THE GERMAN CRUISER \"BLUECHER\"\\r\\n  This dramatic photograph from the great North Sea Battle in 1915 shows\\r\\n  the stricken ship just as she turned turtle and was about to sink.\\r\\n  Officers and men can be seen swarming like ants on the upper side of\\r\\n  the hull.

At Hartlepool, where this scene was enacted, several\\r\\n  civilians, some of them women and children, were killed by bursting\\r\\n  shells of the raiders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmiral von Spee, fearing the Japanese fleet, was already headed for\\r\\nCape Horn. He thought that the Canopus could be easily captured at Port\\r\\nStanley, and he started at once to that port. Admiral Sturdee\\'s\\r\\nexpedition had been kept profoundly secret. On December 7th the British\\r\\nsquadron arrived at Port Stanley, and spent the day coaling. The\\r\\nCanopus, the Glasgow and the Bristol were in the inner harbor, while the\\r\\nremaining vessels lay outside. On December 8th, Admiral von Spee arrived\\r\\nfrom the direction of Cape Horn. The battle that followed is thoroughly\\r\\ndescribed in the report of Vice-Admiral Sturdee from which the\\r\\nfollowing extracts have been made:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At 8 A. M., Tuesday, December 8th, a signal was received from the\\r\\nsignal station on shore. \\'A four-funnel and two-funnel man-of-war in\\r\\nsight from Sapper Hill steering north.\\' The Kent was at once ordered to\\r\\nweigh anchor, and a general signal was made to raise steam for full\\r\\nspeed. At 8.20 the signal service station reported another column of\\r\\nsmoke in sight, and at 8.47 the Canopus reported that the first two\\r\\nships were eight miles off, and that the smoke reported at 8.20 appeared\\r\\nto be the smoke of two ships about twenty miles off. At 9.20 A. M. the\\r\\ntwo leading ships of the enemy, the Gneisenau and Nuremburg, with guns\\r\\ntrained on the wireless station, came within range of the Canopus, which\\r\\nopened fire at them across the lowland at a range of 11,000 yards. The\\r\\nenemy at once hoisted their colors, and turned away. A few minutes later\\r\\nthe two cruisers altered course to port, as though to close the Kent at\\r\\nthe entrance to the harbor. But at about this time it seems that the\\r\\nInvincible and Inflexible were seen over the land, and the enemy at once\\r\\naltered course, and increased speed to join their consorts. At 9.45 A.\\r\\nM. the squadron weighed anchor and proceeded out of the harbor, the\\r\\nCarnovan leading. On passing Cape Pembroke light, the five ships of the\\r\\nenemy appeared clearly in sight to the southeast, hull down. The\\r\\nvisibility was at its maximum, the sea was calm, with a bright sun, a\\r\\nclear sky, and a light breeze from the northwest. At 10.20 the signal\\r\\nfor a general chase was made. At this time the enemy\\'s funnels and\\r\\nbridges showed just above the horizon. Information was received from the\\r\\nBristol at 11.27 that three enemy ships had appeared off Port Pleasant,\\r\\nprobably colliers or transports. The Bristol was therefore directed to\\r\\ntake the Macedonia under orders and destroy transports.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The enemy were still maintaining their distance, and I decided at 12.20\\r\\nP. M. to attack, with the two battle cruisers and the Glasgow. At 12.47\\r\\nP. M. the signal to \\'Open fire and engage the enemy\\' was made. The\\r\\nInflexible opened fire at 12.55 P. M. at the right-hand ship of the\\r\\nenemy, and a few minutes later the Invincible opened fire at the same\\r\\nship. The deliberate fire became too threatening, and when a shell fell\\r\\nclose alongside her at 1.20 p. m. she, the Leipsig, turned away, with\\r\\nthe Nuremburg and Dresden, to the southwest. These light cruisers were\\r\\nat once followed by the Kent, Glasgow and Cornwall.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The action finally developed into three separate encounters. First, the\\r\\naction with the armored cruisers. The fire of the battle cruisers was\\r\\ndirected on the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau. The effect of this was\\r\\nquickly seen, when, with the Scharnhorst leading, they turned about\\r\\nseven points to port, and opened fire. Shortly afterwards the battle\\r\\ncruisers were ordered to turn together with the Invincible leading. The\\r\\nenemy then turned about ten points to starboard, and a second chase\\r\\nensued until, at 2.45, the battle cruisers again opened fire. This\\r\\ncaused the enemy to turn into line ahead to port and open fire. The\\r\\nScharnhorst caught fire forward, but not seriously, and her fire\\r\\nslackened perceptibly. The Gneisenau was badly hit by the Inflexible.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At 3.30 P. M. the Scharnhorst turned about ten points to starboard, her\\r\\nfire had slackened perceptibly, and one shell had shot away her third\\r\\nfunnel. Some guns were not firing, and it would appear that the turn was\\r\\ndictated by a desire to bring her starboard guns into action. The effect\\r\\nof the fire on the Scharnhorst became more and more apparent in\\r\\nconsequence of smoke from fires and also escaping steam. At times a\\r\\nshell would cause a large hole to appear in her side, through which\\r\\ncould be seen a dull, red glow of flame.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At 4.04 P. M. the Scharnhorst, whose flag remained flying to the last,\\r\\nsuddenly listed heavily to port, and within a minute it became clear\\r\\nthat she was a doomed ship, for the list increased very rapidly until\\r\\nshe lay on her beam ends. At 4.17 P. M. she disappeared. The Gneisenau\\r\\npassed on the far side of her late flagship, and continued a determined,\\r\\nbut ineffectual, effort to fight the two battle cruisers. At 5.08 P. M.\\r\\nthe forward funnel was knocked over, and remained resting against the\\r\\nsecond funnel. She was evidently in serious straits, and her fire\\r\\nslackened very much.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At 5.15 P. M. one of the Gneisenau\\'s shells struck the Invincible. This\\r\\nwas her last effective effort. At 5.30 P. M. she turned toward the\\r\\nflagship with a heavy list to starboard, and appeared to stop, the steam\\r\\npouring from her escape pipes, and smoke from shell and fires rising\\r\\neverywhere. About this time I ordered the signal \\'Cease fire,\\' but\\r\\nbefore it was hoisted, the Gneisenau opened fire again, and continued to\\r\\nfire from time to time with a single gun. At 5.40 P. M. the three ships\\r\\nclosed in on the Gneisenau, and at this time the flag flying at her fore\\r\\ntruck, was apparently hauled down, but the flag at the peak continued\\r\\nflying. At 5.50 \\'Cease fire\\' was made. At 6 P. M. the Gneisenau keeled\\r\\nover very suddenly, showing the men gathered on her decks, and then\\r\\nwalking on her side as she lay for a minute on her beam ends before\\r\\nsinking.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The prisoners of war from the Gneisenau report that by the time the\\r\\nammunition was expended some six hundred men had been killed and\\r\\nwounded. When the ship capsized and sank there were probably some two\\r\\nhundred unwounded survivors in the water, but, owing to the shock of the\\r\\ncold water, many were drowned within sight of the boats and ships. Every\\r\\neffort was made to save life as quickly as possible, both by boats and\\r\\nfrom the ships. Life buoys were thrown and ropes lowered, but only a\\r\\nportion could be rescued. The Invincible alone rescued a hundred and\\r\\neight men, fourteen of whom were found to be dead after being brought on\\r\\nboard. These men were buried at sea the following day, with full\\r\\nmilitary honors.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Second, action with the light cruisers. About one P. M. when the\\r\\nScharnhorst and the Gneisenau turned to port to engage the Invincible\\r\\nand the Inflexible, the enemy\\'s light cruisers turned to starboard to\\r\\nescape. The Dresden was leading, and the Nuremburg and Leipzig followed\\r\\non each quarter. In accordance with my instructions, the Glasgow, Kent\\r\\nand Cornwall at once went in chase of these ships. The Glasgow drew well\\r\\nahead of the Cornwall and Kent, and at 3 P. M. shots were exchanged with\\r\\nthe Leipzig at 12,000 yards. The Glasgow\\'s object was to endeavor to\\r\\noutrange the Leipzig, and thus cause her to alter course and give the\\r\\nCornwall and Kent a chance of coming into action. At 4.17 P. M. the\\r\\nCornwall opened fire also on the Leipzig; at 7.17 P. M. the Leipzig was\\r\\non fire fore and aft, and the Cornwall and Glasgow ceased fire. The\\r\\nLeipzig turned over on her port side and disappeared at 9 P. M. Seven\\r\\nofficers and eleven men were saved. At 3.36 P. M. the Cornwall ordered\\r\\nthe Kent to engage the Nuremburg, the nearest cruiser to her. At 6.35 P.\\r\\nM. the Nuremburg was on fire forward, and ceased firing. The Kent also\\r\\nceased firing, then, as the colors were still observed to be flying on\\r\\nthe Nuremburg, the Kent opened fire again. Fire was finally stopped five\\r\\nminutes later, on the colors being hauled down, and every preparation\\r\\nwas made to save life. The Nuremburg sank at 7.27, and as she sank a\\r\\ngroup of men were waving the German ensign attached to a staff.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Twelve men were rescued, but only seven survived. The Kent had four\\r\\nkilled and twelve wounded, mostly caused by one shell. During the time\\r\\nthe three cruisers were engaged with the Nuremburg and Leipzig, the\\r\\nDresden, which was beyond her consorts, effected her escape, owing to\\r\\nher superior speed. The Glasgow was the only cruiser with sufficient\\r\\nspeed to have had any chance of success, however she was fully employed\\r\\nin engaging the Leipzig for over an hour before either the Cornwall or\\r\\nKent could come up and get within range. During this time the Dresden\\r\\nwas able to increase her distance and get out of sight. Three, Action\\r\\nwith the enemy\\'s transports. H.M.S. Macedonia reports that only two\\r\\nships, the steamships Baden and Santa Isabel, were present. Both ships\\r\\nwere sunk after removal of the crews.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThus was annihilated the last squadron belonging to Germany outside the\\r\\nNorth Sea. The defeat of Cradock had been avenged. The British losses\\r\\nwere very small, considering the length of the fight and the desperate\\r\\nefforts of the German fleet. Only one ship of the German squadron was\\r\\nable to escape, and this on account of her great speed. The German\\r\\nsailors went down with colors flying. They died as Cradock\\'s men had\\r\\ndied.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe naval war now entered upon a new phase. The shores of Great Britain\\r\\nhad for many years been so thoroughly protected by the British navy that\\r\\nfew coast fortifications had been built, except at important naval\\r\\nstations. Invasion on a grand scale was plainly impossible, so long as\\r\\nthe British fleets held control of the sea. With German guns across the\\r\\nChannel almost within hearing it was evident that a raiding party might\\r\\neasily reach the English shore on some foggy night. The English people\\r\\nwere much disturbed. They had read the accounts of the horrible\\r\\nbrutalities of the German troops in Belgium and eastern France, and they\\r\\nimagined their feelings if a band of such ferocious brutes were to land\\r\\nin England and pillage their peaceful homes. There was a humorous side\\r\\nto the way in which the yeomanry and territorials entrenched themselves\\r\\nalong the eastern coast line, but the Germans, angry at the failure of\\r\\ntheir fleets, determined to disturb the British peace by raids, slight\\r\\nas the military advantage of such raids might be.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 2d a fleet of German warships sailed from the Elbe. They\\r\\nwere three battle cruisers, the Seydlitz, the Moltke, and the Von Der\\r\\nTann; two armored cruisers, the Blucher and the York, and three light\\r\\ncruisers, the Kolberg, the Graudenz, and the Strasburg. They were mainly\\r\\nfast vessels and the battle cruisers carried eleven-inch guns. Early in\\r\\nthe morning they ran through the nets of a British fishing fleet. Later\\r\\nan old coast police boat, the Halcyon, was shot at a few times. About\\r\\neight o\\'clock they were opposite Yarmouth, and proceeded to bombard that\\r\\nnaval station from a distance of about ten miles. Their range was poor\\r\\nand their shells did no damage. They then turned swiftly for home, but\\r\\non the road back the York struck a mine, and was sunk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map: Great Britain on the West, Denmark and Germany on\\r\\nthe East.]\\r\\n  ENGLISH COAST TOWNS THAT WERE RAIDED\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 16th of December they came again, full of revenge because of the\\r\\ndestruction of von Spee and his squadron. Early in the morning early\\r\\nrisers in Scarborough saw in the north four strange ships. Scarborough\\r\\nwas absolutely without defense. It had once been an artillery depot but\\r\\nin recent years had been a cavalry station, and some few troops of this\\r\\nservice were quartered there. Otherwise it was an open seaside resort.\\r\\nThe German ships poured shells into the defenseless town, aiming at\\r\\nevery large object they could see, the Grand Hotel, the gas works, the\\r\\nwater works and the wireless station. Churches, public buildings, and\\r\\nhospitals were hit, as well as private houses. Over five hundred shells\\r\\nwere fired. Then the ships turned around and moved away. The streets\\r\\nwere crowded with puzzled and scared inhabitants, many of whom, as is\\r\\ncustomary in watering places, were women, children and invalids.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt nine o\\'clock Whitby, a coast town near Scarborough, saw two great\\r\\nships steaming up from the south. Ten minutes later the ships were\\r\\nfiring. The old Abbey of Hilda and Cedman was struck, but on the whole\\r\\nlittle damage was done. Another division of the invaders visited the\\r\\nHartlepools. There there was a small fort, with a battery of\\r\\nold-fashioned guns, and off the shore was a small British flotilla, a\\r\\ngunboat and two destroyers. The three battle cruisers among the German\\r\\nraiders opened fire. The little British fleet did what they could but\\r\\nwere quickly driven off. The German ships then approached the shore and\\r\\nfired on the English battery, the first fight with a foreign foe in\\r\\nEngland since 1690. The British battery consisted of some territorials\\r\\nwho stood without wavering to their guns and kept up for half an hour a\\r\\nfurious cannonading. A great deal of damage was done; churches,\\r\\nhospitals, workhouses and schools were all hit. The total death roll was\\r\\n119, and the wounded over 300. Six hundred houses were damaged or\\r\\ndestroyed, but there was a great deal of heroism, not only among the\\r\\nterritorials, but among the inhabitants of the town, and when the last\\r\\nshots were fired all turned to the work of relief.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomewhere between nine and ten o\\'clock the bold German fleet started for\\r\\nhome. The British Grand Fleet had been notified of the raid and two\\r\\nbattle cruiser squadrons were hurrying to intercept them. But the\\r\\nweather had thickened and the waters of the North Sea were covered with\\r\\nfog belts stretching for hundreds of miles. And so the raiders returned\\r\\nsafe to receive their Iron Crosses. The German aim in such raids was\\r\\nprobably to create a panic, and so interfere with the English military\\r\\nplans. If the English had not looked at the matter with common sense\\r\\nthey might easily have been tempted to spend millions of pounds on\\r\\nseaboard fortifications, and keep millions of men at home who were more\\r\\nnecessary in the armies in France. But the English people kept their\\r\\nheads.\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany, perceiving the indignation of the world at these bombardments\\r\\nof defenseless watering places, endeavored to appease criticism by\\r\\ndescribing them as fortified towns. But the well-known excellence of the\\r\\nGerman system of espionage makes it plain that they knew the true\\r\\ncondition of affairs. These towns were not selected as fortified towns,\\r\\nbut because they were not, and destruction in unfortified towns it was\\r\\nthought would have a greater effect than in a fortified town where it\\r\\nwould be regarded as among the natural risks of war.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the rest of the year of 1914 no further sea fight took place in\\r\\nthe North Sea nor was there any serious loss to the navy from torpedo or\\r\\nsubmarine. But on the first of January, 1915, the British ship\\r\\nFormidable, 15,000 tons, was struck by two torpedoes and sunk. The\\r\\nprevious day she had left Sheerness with eight vessels of the Channel\\r\\nfleet and with no protection from destroyers. The night was a bright\\r\\nmoonlight and for such vessels to be moving in line on such a night\\r\\nwithout destroyers shows gross carelessness. Out of a crew of 800 men\\r\\nonly 201 were saved, and the rescue of this part of the crew was due to\\r\\nthe seamanship of Captain Pillar of the trawler Providence, who managed\\r\\nto take most of those rescued on board his vessel.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 24th the German battle cruiser squadron under Rear-Admiral\\r\\nHipper set sail from Wilhelmshaven. What his object was is not known. He\\r\\nhad enlarged the mine field north of Helgoland and north of the mine\\r\\nfield had stationed a submarine flotilla. It is likely that he was\\r\\nplanning to induce the British fleet to follow him into the mine field,\\r\\nor within reach of his submarines. That same morning the British battle\\r\\ncruiser squadron under Vice-Admiral Sir David Beatty put to sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the official report of the English Admiral he was in\\r\\ncommand of the following vessels; battle cruisers, the Lion, Princess\\r\\nRoyal, the Tiger, the New Zealand, and the Indomitable; light cruisers,\\r\\nthe Southampton, the Nottingham, the Birmingham, the Lowestoft, the\\r\\nArethusa, the Aurora and the Undaunted, with destroyer flotillas under\\r\\nCommodore Tyrwhitt. The German Admiral had with him the Seydlitz, the\\r\\nMoltke, the Derfflinger, the Blucher, six light cruisers and a destroyer\\r\\nflotilla. The English Admiral apparently had some hint of the plans of\\r\\nthe German squadron. The night of the 23d had been foggy; in the\\r\\nmorning, however, the wind came from the northeast and cleared off the\\r\\nmists. An abridgment of the official report gives a good account of the\\r\\nbattle, sometimes called the battle of Dogger Bank:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At 7.25 A. M. the flash of guns was observed south-southeast; shortly\\r\\nafterwards the report reached me from the Aurora that she was engaged\\r\\nwith enemy ships. I immediately altered course to south-southeast,\\r\\nincreased speed, and ordered the light cruisers and flotillas to get in\\r\\ntouch and report movements of enemy. This order was acted upon with\\r\\ngreat promptitude, indeed my wishes had already been forestalled by the\\r\\nrespective senior officers, and reports almost immediately followed from\\r\\nthe Southampton, Arethusa, and Aurora as to the position and composition\\r\\nof the enemy. The enemy had altered their course to southeast; from now\\r\\nonward the light cruisers maintained touch with the enemy and kept me\\r\\nfully informed as to their movements. The battle cruisers worked up to\\r\\nfull speed, steering to the southward; the wind at the time was\\r\\nnortheast, light, with extreme visibility.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At 7.30 A. M. the enemy were sighted on the port bow, steaming fast,\\r\\nsteering approximately southeast, distance fourteen miles. Owing to the\\r\\nprompt reports received we had attained our position on the quarter of\\r\\nthe enemy, and altered course to run parallel to them. We then settled\\r\\ndown to a long stern chase, gradually increasing our speed until we\\r\\nreached 28.5 knots.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Great credit is due to the engineer staffs of the New Zealand and\\r\\nIndomitable. These ships greatly exceeded their speed. At 8.52 A. M., as\\r\\nwe had closed within 20,000 yards of the rear ship, the battle cruisers\\r\\nmaneuvered so that guns would bear and the Lion fired a single shot\\r\\nwhich fell short. The enemy at this time were in single line ahead, with\\r\\nlight cruisers ahead and a large number of destroyers on their starboard\\r\\nbeam. Single shots were fired at intervals to test the range, and at\\r\\n9.09 the Lion made her first hit on the Blucher, the rear ship of the\\r\\nGerman line. At 9.20 the Tiger opened fire on the Blucher, and the Lion\\r\\nshifted to the third in the line, this ship being hit by several salvos.\\r\\nThe enemy returned our fire at 9.14 A. M., the Princess Royal, on coming\\r\\ninto range, opened fire on the Blucher. The New Zealand was also within\\r\\nrange of the Blucher which had dropped somewhat astern, and opened fire\\r\\non her. The Princess Royal then shifted to the third ship in the line\\r\\n(Derfflinger) inflicting considerable damage on her. Our flotilla\\r\\ncruisers and destroyers had gradually dropped from a position, broad on\\r\\nour beam, to our port quarter, so as not to foul our range with their\\r\\nsmoke. But the enemy\\'s destroyers threatening attack, the Meteor and M\\r\\ndivision passed ahead of us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About 9.45 the situation was about as follows: The Blucher, the fourth\\r\\nin their line, showed signs of having suffered severely from gun fire,\\r\\ntheir leading ship and number three were also on fire. The enemy\\'s\\r\\ndestroyers emitted vast columns of smoke to screen their battle\\r\\ncruisers, and under cover of this the latter now appeared to have\\r\\naltered course to the northward to increase their distance. The battle\\r\\ncruisers therefore were ordered to form a line of bearing\\r\\nnorth-northwest, and proceeded at the utmost speed. Their destroyers\\r\\nthen showed evident signs of an attempt to attack. The Lion and the\\r\\nTiger opened fire upon them, and caused them to retire and resume their\\r\\noriginal course.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At 10.48 A. M. the Blucher, which had dropped considerably astern of\\r\\nthe enemy\\'s line, hauled out to port, steering north with a heavy list,\\r\\non fire, and apparently in a defeated condition. I consequently ordered\\r\\nthe Indomitable to attack the enemy breaking northward. At 10.54\\r\\nsubmarines were reported on the starboard bow, and I personally observed\\r\\nthe wash of a periscope. I immediately turned to port. At 10.03 an\\r\\ninjury to the Lion being reported as being incapable of immediate\\r\\nrepair, I directed the Lion to shape course northwest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At 11.20 I called the Attack alongside, shifting my flag to her, and\\r\\nproceeded at utmost speed to rejoin the squadron. I met them at noon,\\r\\nretiring north-northwest. I boarded and hoisted my flag on the Princess\\r\\nRoyal, when Captain Brock acquainted me with what had occurred since the\\r\\nLion fell out of line, namely, that the Blucher had been sunk and that\\r\\nthe enemy battle cruisers had continued their course to the eastward in\\r\\na considerably damaged condition. He also informed me that a Zeppelin\\r\\nand a seaplane had endeavored to drop bombs on the vessels which went to\\r\\nthe rescue of the survivors of the Blucher.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt appears from this report that as soon as the Germans sighted the\\r\\nBritish fleet they promptly turned around and fled to the southeast.\\r\\nThis flight, before they could have known the full British strength,\\r\\nsuggests that the German Admiral was hoping to lure the British vessels\\r\\ninto the Helgoland trap. The British gunnery was remarkably good, shot\\r\\nafter shot taking effect at a distance of ten miles, and that too when\\r\\nmoving at over thirty miles an hour. Over 120 of the crew of the Blucher\\r\\nwere rescued and more would have been rescued if it had not been for the\\r\\nattack upon the rescue parties by the German aircraft. The injury to the\\r\\nLion was very unfortunate. Admiral Beatty handed over charge of the\\r\\nbattle cruisers to Rear-Admiral Moore, and when he was able to overtake\\r\\nthe squadron he found that under Admiral Moore\\'s orders the British\\r\\nfleet were retiring. The British squadron at the moment of turning was\\r\\nseventy miles from Helgoland, and in no danger from its mine fields.\\r\\nWhat might have been a crushing victory became therefore only a partial\\r\\none: the Germans lost the Blucher; the Derfflinger and the Seydlitz were\\r\\nbadly injured, but it seems that with a little more persistence the\\r\\nwhole German squadron might have been destroyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result was a serious blow to Germany. This engagement was the first\\r\\nbetween modern big-gun ships. Particular interest is also attached to it\\r\\nbecause each squadron was accompanied by scouting and screening light\\r\\ncruisers and destroyers. It was fear of submarines and mines, moreover,\\r\\nthat influenced the British to break off the engagement. A Zeppelin\\r\\nairship and a seaplane also took part, and perhaps assisted in the fire\\r\\ncontrol of the Germans. The conditions surrounding this battle were\\r\\nideal for illustrating the functions of battle cruisers. The German\\r\\nwarship raid on the British coast of the previous month was still fresh\\r\\nin mind, and when this situation off the Dogger Bank arose the timely\\r\\ninterposing of Admiral Beatty\\'s superior force, the fast chase, the\\r\\nlong-range fighting, the loss of the Blucher and the hasty retreat of\\r\\nthe enemy, were all particularly pleasing to the British people. As a\\r\\nresult the battle cruiser type of ship attained great popularity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIV\\r\\n\\r\\nNEW METHODS AND HORRORS OF WARFARE\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Germany embarked upon its policy of frightfulness, it held in\\r\\nreserve murderous inventions that had been contributed to the German\\r\\nGeneral Staff by chemists and other scientists working in conjunction\\r\\nwith the war. Never since the dawn of time had there been such a\\r\\nperversion of knowledge to criminal purposes; never had science\\r\\ncontributed such a deadly toll to the fanatic and criminal intentions of\\r\\na war-crazed class.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the war uncoiled its weary length, and month after month of embargo\\r\\nand privation saw the morale of the German nation growing steadily\\r\\nlower, these murderous inventions were successively called into play\\r\\nagainst the Allies, but as each horror was put into play on the\\r\\nbattle-field, its principles were solved by the scientists of the Allied\\r\\nnations, and the deadly engine of destruction was turned with trebled\\r\\nforce against the Huns.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis happened with the various varieties of poison gas, with liquid\\r\\nfire, with trench knives, with nail-studded clubs, with armor used by\\r\\nshock troops, with airplane bombs, with cannon throwing projectiles\\r\\nweighing thousands of pounds great distances behind the battle lines.\\r\\nNot only did America and the Allies improve upon Germany\\'s pattern in\\r\\nthese respects, but they added a few inventions that went far toward\\r\\nturning the scale against Germany. An example of these is the \"tank.\"\\r\\nOriginally this was a caterpillar tractor invented in America and\\r\\nadopted in England. At first these were of two varieties, the male,\\r\\ncarrying heavy guns only, and the females, equipped with machine guns.\\r\\nTo these was later added the whippet tank, named after the racing dog\\r\\ndeveloped in England. These whippet tanks averaged eighteen miles an\\r\\nhour, carrying death and terror into the ranks of the enemy. All the\\r\\ntanks were heavily armored and had as their motto the significant words\\r\\n\"Treat \\'Em Rough.\" The Germans designed a heavy anti-tank rifle about\\r\\nthree feet longer than the ordinary rifle and carrying a charge\\r\\ncalculated to pierce tank armor. These were issued to the German first\\r\\nline trenches at the rate of three to a company. That they were not\\r\\nparticularly effective was proved by the ease with which the tanks of\\r\\nall varieties tore through the barbed wire entanglements and passed over\\r\\nthe Hindenburg and Kriemhild lines, supposed by the Germans to be\\r\\nimpregnable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tanks in effect were mobile artillery and were used as such by all\\r\\nthe Allied troops. Germany frantically endeavored to manufacture tanks\\r\\nto meet the Allied monsters, but their efforts were feeble when compared\\r\\nwith the great output opposed to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore considering other inventions used for the first time in this war,\\r\\nit is well to understand the tremendous changes in methods and tactics\\r\\nmade necessary by these discoveries.\\r\\n\\r\\nPut into a sentence, the changed warfare amounts to this: it is a\\r\\nmobilization of material, of railroads, great guns, machine guns, food,\\r\\nairplanes and other engines of destruction quite as much as it is a\\r\\nmobilization of men.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Germans won battle after battle at the beginning of the war because\\r\\nof their system of strategic railways that made it possible to transport\\r\\nhuge armies to selected points in the shortest possible time both on the\\r\\neastern and the western fronts. Lacking a system of transportation to\\r\\nmatch this, Russia lost the great battles that decided her fate, Belgium\\r\\nwas over-run, and France, once the border was passed, became a\\r\\nbattle-field upon which the Germans might extend their trench systems\\r\\nover the face of the land.\\r\\n\\r\\nLacking strategic railways to match those of Germany, France evolved an\\r\\neffective substitute in the modern system of automobile transportation.\\r\\nWhen von Kluck swung aside from Paris in his first great rush, Gallieni\\r\\nsent out from Paris an army in taxicabs that struck the exposed flank\\r\\nand went far toward winning the first battle of the Marne. It was the\\r\\ntruck transportation system of the French along the famous \"Sacred Road\"\\r\\nback of the battle line at Verdun that kept inviolate the motto of the\\r\\nheroic town, \"They Shall Not Pass.\" Motor trucks that brought American\\r\\nreserves in a khaki flood won the second battle of the Marne. It was\\r\\nautomobile transportation that enabled Haig to send the British\\r\\nCanadians and Australians in full cry after the retreating Germans when\\r\\nthe backbone of the German resistance was broken before Lens, Cambrai,\\r\\nand Ostend.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerica\\'s railway transportation system in France was one of the marvels\\r\\nof the war. Stretching from the sector of seacoast set apart for America\\r\\nby the French Government, it radiated far into the interior, delivering\\r\\nmen, munitions and food in a steady stream. American engineers worked\\r\\nwith their brothers-in-arms with the Allies to construct an\\r\\ninter-weaving system of wide-gauge and narrow-gauge roads that served to\\r\\nvictual and munition the entire front and further serve to deliver at\\r\\ntop speed whole army corps. It was this network of strategic railways\\r\\nthat enabled the French to send an avalanche clad in horizon-blue to the\\r\\nrelief of Amiens when Hindenburg made his final tremendous effort of\\r\\n1918.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn its essentials, military effort in the great conflict may be roughly\\r\\ndivided into\\r\\n  Open warfare,\\r\\n  Trench warfare,\\r\\n  Crater warfare.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first battle of the Marne was almost wholly open warfare; so also\\r\\nwere the battles of the Masurian Lakes, Allenstein, and Dunajec in the\\r\\neastern theater of war, and most of the warfare on the Italian front\\r\\nbetween the Piave River and Gorizia.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this variety of battle, airplanes and observation balloons play a\\r\\nprominent part. Once the enemy is driven out of its trenches, the\\r\\nmessage is flashed by wireless to the artillery and slaughter at long\\r\\nrange begins. If there have been no intrenchments, as was the case in\\r\\nthe first battle of the Marne, massed artillery send a plunging fire\\r\\ninto the columns moving in open order and prepare the way for machine\\r\\ngunners and infantry to finish the rout.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn previous wars, cavalry played a heroic role in open warfare; only\\r\\nrarely has it been possible to use cavalry in the Great War. The Germans\\r\\nsent a screen of Uhlans before its advancing hordes into Belgium and\\r\\nNorthern France in 1914. The Uhlans also were in the van in the Russian\\r\\ninvasion, but with these exceptions, German cavalry was a negligible\\r\\nfactor.\\r\\n\\r\\nBritish and French cavalry were active in pursuit of the fleeing Teutons\\r\\nwhen the Hindenburg line was smashed in September of 1918. Outside of\\r\\nthat brief episode, the cavalry did comparatively nothing so far as the\\r\\nAllies were concerned. It was the practice on both sides to dismount\\r\\ncavalry and convert it into some form of trench service. Trench mortar\\r\\ncompanies, bombing squads, and other specialty groups were organized\\r\\nfrom among the cavalrymen. Of course the fighting in the open stretches\\r\\nof Mesopotamia, South Africa and Russia involved the use of great bodies\\r\\nof cavalry. The trend of modern warfare, however, is to equip the\\r\\ncavalryman with grenades and bayonets, in addition to his ordinary gear,\\r\\nand to make of him practically a mounted infantryman.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrench warfare occupied most of the time and made nine-tenths of the\\r\\ndiscomforts of the soldiers of both armies. If proof of the adaptive\\r\\ncapacity of the human animal were needed, it is afforded by the manner\\r\\nin which the men burrowed in vermin-infested earth and lived there under\\r\\nconditions of Arctic cold, frequently enduring long deprivations of\\r\\nfood, fuel, and suitable clothing. During the early stages of the war,\\r\\nbefore men became accustomed to the rigors of the trenches, many\\r\\nthousands died as a direct result of the exposure. Many thousand of\\r\\nothers were incapacitated for life by \"trench feet,\" a group of maladies\\r\\ncovering the consequences of exposure to cold and water which in those\\r\\nearly days flowed in rivulets through most of the trenches. The trenches\\r\\nat Gallipoli had their own special brand of maladies. Heatstroke and a\\r\\nmalarial infection were among these disabling agencies. Trench fever, a\\r\\nmalady beginning with a headache and sometimes ending in partial\\r\\nparalysis and death, was another common factor in the mortality records.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in spite of all these and other discomforts, in spite of the\\r\\ndisgusting vermin that crawled upon the men both in winter and in\\r\\nsummer, both sides mastered the trenches and in the end learned to live\\r\\nin them with some degree of comfort.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first the trenches were comparatively straight, shallow affairs; then\\r\\nas the artillery searched them out, as the machine gunners learned the\\r\\nart of looping their fire so that the bullets would drop into the hiding\\r\\nplaces of the enemy, the trench systems gradually became more\\r\\nscientifically involved. After the Germans had been beaten at the Marne\\r\\nand had retired to their prepared positions along the Aisne, there\\r\\ncommenced a series of flanking attempts by one side and the other which\\r\\nspeedily resolved itself into the famous \"race to the sea.\" This was a\\r\\ncompetition between the opposing armies in rapid trench digging. The\\r\\neffort on either side was made to prevent the enemy from executing a\\r\\nflank movement. In an amazingly short time the opposing trenches\\r\\nextended from the Belgian coast to the Swiss border, making further\\r\\noutflanking attempts impossible of achievement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map: The North Sea and surrounding countries--Norway,\\r\\nDenmark, Great Britain, France, Belgium, Holland, Germany.]\\r\\n  FORTS, FLYING AND NAVAL BASES ON THE NORTH SEA\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was not the first time in history that intrenched armies opposed\\r\\neach other. The Civil War in this country set the fashion in that\\r\\nrespect. The contending sides in the Great War, however, improved vastly\\r\\nupon the American example. Communicating trenches were constructed,\\r\\nleading back to the company kitchens, and finally to the open road\\r\\nleading back to the rest billets of the armies.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen night raiding commenced, it was speedily seen that straight\\r\\ntrenches exposed whole companies of men to enfilading fire. Thereupon\\r\\nbastions were made and new defenses presented by zig-zagging the\\r\\nfront-line trenches and the communicating ditches as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the formidable obstacles presented by the trenches, equipped as they\\r\\nwere with sand-bag parapets and firing steps, were added barbed-wire\\r\\nentanglements and pitfalls of various sorts. The greatest improvement\\r\\nwas made by the Germans, and they added \"pill boxes.\" These were really\\r\\nminiature fortresses of concrete and armor plate with a dome-shaped\\r\\nroof and loopholes for machine gunners. Only a direct hit by a\\r\\nprojectile from a big gun served to demolish a \"pill box.\" The Allies\\r\\nlearned after many costly experiments that the best method to overcome\\r\\nthese obstacles was to pass over and beyond them, leaving them isolated\\r\\nin Allied territory, where they were captured at the leisure of the\\r\\nattackers.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrench warfare brings with it new instruments. There are the flame\\r\\nprojectors, which throw fire to a distance of approximately a hundred\\r\\nfeet. The Germans were the first to use these, but they were excelled in\\r\\nthis respect by the inventive genius of the nations opposing them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of poison gas, the word being used in its broad sense, is now\\r\\ngeneral. It was first used by the Germans, but as in the case of flame\\r\\nthrowers, the Allies soon gained the ascendency.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Four photographs of tanks.]\\r\\n  TYPES OF LAND BATTLESHIPS DEVELOPED BY ALLIES AND GERMANS\\r\\n  British light tank, of 1918, with turret action and high speed\\r\\n  British Tank of earliest type, as used at Cambrai.\\r\\n  German land battleship in 1918 on the Western front\\r\\n  Improved French Tank first used in Champagne in 1916.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Painting]\\r\\n  CHARGING ON GERMAN TRENCHES IN GAS MASKS\\r\\n  Each British soldier carried two gas-proof helmets. At the first alarm\\r\\n  of gas the helmet was instantly adjusted, for to breathe even a whiff\\r\\n  of the yellow cloud meant death or serious injury. This picture shows\\r\\n  the earlier type before the respirator mask was devised to keep up\\r\\n  with Germany\\'s development of gas warfare.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first use of asphyxiating gas was by the Germans during the first\\r\\nbattle of Ypres. There the deadly compound was mixed in huge reservoirs\\r\\nback of the German lines. From these extended a system of pipes with\\r\\nvents pointed toward the British and Canadian lines. Waiting until air\\r\\ncurrents were moving steadily westward, the Germans opened the\\r\\nstop-cocks shortly after midnight and the poisonous fumes swept slowly,\\r\\nrelentlessly forward in a greenish cloud that moved close to the earth.\\r\\nThe result of that fiendish and cowardly act was that thousands of men\\r\\ndied in horrible agony without a chance for their lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides that first asphyxiating gas, there soon developed others even\\r\\nmore deadly. The base of most of these was chlorine. Then came the\\r\\nlachrymatory or \"tear-compelling\" gases, calculated to produce\\r\\ntemporary or permanent blindness. Another German \"triumph\" was mustard\\r\\ngas. This is spread in gas shells, as are all the modern gases. The\\r\\nGermans abandoned the cumbersome gas-distributing system after the\\r\\ninvention of the gas shell. These make a peculiar gobbling sound as they\\r\\nrush overhead. They explode with a very slight noise and scatter their\\r\\ncontents broadcast. The liquids carried by them are usually of the sort\\r\\nthat decompose rapidly when exposed to the air and give off the acrid\\r\\ngases dreaded by the soldiers. They are directed against the artillery\\r\\nas well as against intrenched troops. Every command, no matter how\\r\\nsmall, has its warning signal in the shape of a gong or a siren warning\\r\\nof approaching gas.\\r\\n\\r\\nGas masks were speedily discovered to offset the dangers of poison gases\\r\\nof all kinds. These were worn not only by troops in the field, but by\\r\\nartillery horses, pack mules, liaison dogs, and by the civilian\\r\\ninhabitants in back of the battle lines. Where used quickly and in\\r\\naccordance with instructions, these masks were a complete protection\\r\\nagainst attacks by gas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe perfected gas masks used by both sides contained a chamber filled\\r\\nwith a specially prepared charcoal. Peach pits were collected by the\\r\\nmillions in all the belligerent countries to make this charcoal, and\\r\\nother vegetable substances of similar density were also used. Anti-gas\\r\\nchemicals were mixed with the charcoal. The wearer of the mask breathed\\r\\nentirely through the mouth, gripping a rubber mouthpiece while his nose\\r\\nwas pinched shut by a clamp attached to the mask.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn training, soldiers were required to hold their breath for six seconds\\r\\nwhile the mask was being adjusted. It was explained to them that four\\r\\nbreaths of the deadly chlorine gas was sufficient to kill; the first\\r\\nbreath produced a spasm of the glottis; the second brought mental\\r\\nconfusion and delirium; the third produced unconsciousness; and the\\r\\nfourth, death. The bag containing the gas mask and respirator was\\r\\ncarried always by the soldier.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soldier during the winter season in the front line trenches was a\\r\\ngrotesque figure. His head was crowned with a helmet covered with khaki\\r\\nbecause the glint of steel would advertise his whereabouts. Beneath the\\r\\nhelmet he wore a close fitting woolen cap pulled down tightly around his\\r\\nears and sometimes tied or buttoned beneath his chin. Suspended upon his\\r\\nchest was the khaki bag containing gas mask and respirator. Over his\\r\\nouter garments were his belt, brace straps, bayonet and ammunition\\r\\npouches. His rifle was slung upon his shoulder with the foot of a woolen\\r\\nsock covering the muzzle and the leg of the same sock wrapped around the\\r\\nbreech. A large jerkin made of leather, without sleeves, was worn over\\r\\nthe short coat. Long rubber boots reaching to the hips and strapped at\\r\\nankle and hip completely covered his legs. When anticipating trench\\r\\nraids, or on a raiding party, a handy trench knife and carefully slung\\r\\ngrenades were added to his equipment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAirplane bombing ultimately changed the whole character of the war. It\\r\\nextended the fighting lines miles behind the battle front. It brought\\r\\nthe horrors of night attacks upon troops resting in billets. It visited\\r\\ndestruction and death upon the civilian population of cities scores of\\r\\nmiles back of the actual front.\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany transgressed repeatedly the laws of humanity by bombing\\r\\nhospitals far behind the battle front. Describing one of these atrocious\\r\\nattacks, which took place May 29, 1918, Colonel G. H. Andrews, chaplain\\r\\nof a Canadian regiment, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The building bombed was one of three large Red Cross hospitals at\\r\\nBoulenes and was filled with Allied wounded. A hospital in which were a\\r\\nnumber of wounded German prisoners stood not very far away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Germans could not possibly have mistaken the building they bombed\\r\\nfor anything else but a hospital. There were flags with a red cross\\r\\nflying, and lights were turned on them so that they would show\\r\\nprominently. And the windows were brilliantly lighted. Those inside\\r\\nheard the buzz of the advancing airplanes, but did not give them a\\r\\nthought.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The machines came right on, ignoring the hospital with the German\\r\\nwounded, indicating they had full knowledge of their objective, until\\r\\nthey were over a wing of the Red Cross hospital that contained the\\r\\noperating room on the ground floor. In the operating room a man was on\\r\\nthe table for a most difficult surgical feat. Around him were gathered\\r\\nthe staff of the hospital and its brilliant surgeons. Lieutenant Sage of\\r\\nNew York had just given him the anesthetic when one of the airplanes let\\r\\nthe bomb drop. It was a big fellow. It must have been all of 250 pounds\\r\\nof high explosive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It hurtled downward, carrying the two floors before it. Through the gap\\r\\nthus made wounded men, the beds in which they lay, convalescents, and\\r\\nall on the floors came crashing down to the ground. The bomb\\'s force\\r\\nextended itself to wreck the operating room, where the man on the table,\\r\\nLieutenant Sage, and all in the room were killed. In all there were\\r\\nthirty-seven lives lost, including three Red Cross nurses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The building caught fire. The concussion had blown the stairs down, so\\r\\nthat escape from the upper floors seemed impossible. But the\\r\\nconvalescents and the soldiers, who had run to the scene of the bombing,\\r\\nlet the very ill ones out of the windows, and escape was made in that\\r\\nway.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And then, to cap the climax, the German airplanes returned over the\\r\\nspot of their ghastly triumph and fired on the rescuers with machine\\r\\nguns. God will never forgive the Huns for that act alone. Nor will our\\r\\ncomrades ever forget it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe statement of Colonel Andrews was corroborated by a number of other\\r\\nofficers.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo protect artillery against counter-fire of all kinds, both sides from\\r\\nthe beginning used the art of camouflage. This was resorted to\\r\\nparticularly against scouting airplanes. At first the branches of trees\\r\\nand similar natural cover were used to deceive the airmen. Later the\\r\\nguns themselves were painted with protective colorations, and screens of\\r\\nburlap were used instead of branches. The camoufleur, as the camouflage\\r\\nartist was called, speedily extended his activities to screens over\\r\\nhighways, preventing airmen from seeing troops in motion, to the\\r\\nprotective coloration of lookout posts, and of other necessary factors\\r\\nalong the fighting front. Camouflage also found great usefulness in the\\r\\nprotective coloration of battleships and merchant vessels. Scientific\\r\\nstudy went hand in hand with the art, the object being to confuse the\\r\\nenemy and to offer targets as small as possible to the enemy gunners.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrater warfare came as a development of intensified artillery attacks\\r\\nupon trench systems. It was at Dunajec on the eastern front that for the\\r\\nfirst time in modern war the wheels of artillery were placed hub to hub\\r\\nin intensified hurricane fire upon enemy positions. The result there\\r\\nunder von Mackensen\\'s direction was the rout of the Russians. When later\\r\\nthe same tactics were employed on the western front, the result was to\\r\\ndestroy whole trench systems with the exception of deep dugouts, and to\\r\\nsend the occupants of the trenches into the craters, made by shell\\r\\nexplosions, for protection.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was observed that, these craters made excellent cover and when linked\\r\\nby vigorous use of the intrenching tools carried by every soldier, they\\r\\nmade a fair substitute for the trenches. This observation gave root to\\r\\nan idea which was followed by both armies; this was the deliberate\\r\\ncreation of crater systems by the artillery of the attacking force. Into\\r\\nthese lines of craters the attacking infantry threw itself in wave after\\r\\nwave as it rushed toward the enemy trenches. The ground is so riddled by\\r\\nthis intensive artillery fire that there is created what is known as\\r\\n\"moon terrain\", fields resembling the surface of the moon as seen\\r\\nthrough a powerful telescope. Troops on both sides were trained to\\r\\nutilize these shell holes to the utmost, each little group occupying a\\r\\ncrater, keeping in touch with its nearest group and moving steadily in\\r\\nunison toward the enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne detail in which this war surpassed all others was in the use of\\r\\nmachine guns and grenades. The Germans were first to make extensive use\\r\\nof the machine gun as a weapon with which to produce an effective\\r\\nbarrage. They established machine-gun nests at frequent intervals\\r\\ncommanding the zone over which infantry was to advance and by skilful\\r\\ncrossfire kept that terrain free from every living thing. The Germans\\r\\npreferred a machine gun, water cooled and of the barrel-recoil type. The\\r\\nEnglish used a Vickers-Maxim and a Lewis gun, the latter the invention\\r\\nof an officer in the American army. The French preferred the Hotchkiss\\r\\nand the Saint-Etienne. The Americans standardized the Browning light and\\r\\nheavy machine guns, and these did effective service. It was asserted by\\r\\nAmerican gunnery experts that the Browning excels all other weapons of\\r\\nits type.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo general types of grenades were used on both sides. One a defensive\\r\\nbomb about the size of an orange, containing a bursting charge weighing\\r\\ntwenty-two ounces. Then there was a grenade used for offensive work\\r\\ncarrying about thirty-two ounces of high explosives. The defensive\\r\\ngrenades were of cast iron and so made that they burst into more than a\\r\\nhundred jagged pieces when they exploded. These wounded or killed within\\r\\na radius of one hundred and fifty yards. In exceptional instances, the\\r\\nrange was higher.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe function of artillery in a modern battle is constantly extending.\\r\\nBoth the big guns and the howitzers were the deciding factors in most of\\r\\nthe military decisions reached during the war. Artillery is divided\\r\\nfirst between the big guns having a comparatively flat trajectory and\\r\\nthe howitzers whose trajectory is curved. Then there is a further\\r\\ndivision into these four classes:\\r\\n  Field artillery,\\r\\n  Heavy artillery,\\r\\n  Railroad artillery,\\r\\n  Trench artillery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe type of field artillery is the famous 75-millimeter gun used\\r\\ninterchangeably by the French and Americans. It is a quick-firing weapon\\r\\nand is used against attacking masses and for the various kind of\\r\\nbarrages, including an anti-aircraft barrage.\\r\\n\\r\\nIncluded in the heavy artillery are guns and howitzers of larger caliber\\r\\nthan the 75-millimeter. Three distinct and terrifying noises accompany\\r\\nexplosions of these guns. First, there is the explosion when the shell\\r\\nleaves the gun; then there is the peculiar rattling noise like the\\r\\npassing of a railway train when the shells pass overhead; then there is\\r\\nthe explosion at point of contact, a terrific concussion which produces\\r\\nthe human condition called \"shell-shock,\" a derangement of body and\\r\\nbrain, paralyzing nerve and muscle centers and frequently producing\\r\\ninsanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe railroad artillery comprises huge guns pulled on railways by\\r\\nlocomotives, each gun having a number of cars as part of its equipment.\\r\\nThese are slow-firing guns of great power and hurling the largest\\r\\nprojectiles known to warfare. The largest guns of this class were\\r\\nproduced by American inventive genius as a reply to the German gun of\\r\\nSt. Gobain Forest. This was a weapon which hurled a nine-inch shell from\\r\\na distance of sixty-two miles into the heart of Paris. The damage done\\r\\nby it was comparatively slight and it had no appreciable effect upon the\\r\\nmorale of the Parisians.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts greatest damage was when it struck the Roman Catholic Church of St.\\r\\nGervais on Good Friday, March 29, 1918, killing seventy-five persons and\\r\\nwounding ninety. Fifty-four of those killed were women, five being\\r\\nAmericans. The total effect of the bombardment by this big gun was to\\r\\narouse France, England and America to a fiercer fighting pitch. The late\\r\\nCardinal Farley, Archbishop of New York, expressed this sentiment, when\\r\\nhe sent the following message to the Archbishop of Paris:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nShocked by the brutal killing of innocent victims gathered at religious\\r\\nservices to commemorate the passing of our blessed Saviour on Good\\r\\nFriday, the Catholics of New York join your noble protest against this\\r\\noutrage of the sanctuary on such a day and at such an hour and,\\r\\nexpressing their sympathy to the bereaved relatives of the dead and\\r\\ninjured, pledge their unfaltering allegiance in support of the common\\r\\ncause that unites our two great republics. May God bless the brave\\r\\nofficers and men of the Allied armies in their splendid defense of\\r\\nliberty and justice!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTrench artillery are Stokes guns and other mortars hurling aerial\\r\\ntorpedoes containing great quantities of high explosives. These have\\r\\ncurved trajectories and are effective not only against trenches but also\\r\\nagainst deep dugouts, wire entanglements and listening posts.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most important details of modern warfare is that of\\r\\ncommunication or liaison on the battlefield. This is accomplished by\\r\\nrunners recruited from the trenches, by dogs, pigeons, telephone, radio.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs has been heretofore stated, the airplane considered in all its\\r\\ndevelopments, is the newest and most important of factors in modern\\r\\nwarfare. It photographs the enemy positions, it detects concentrations\\r\\nand other movements of the enemy, it makes surprise impossible, it is a\\r\\ndeadly engine of destruction when used in spraying machine-gun fire upon\\r\\ntroops in the open. As a bombing device, it surpasses the best and most\\r\\naccurate artillery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XV\\r\\n\\r\\nGERMAN PLOTS AND PROPAGANDA IN AMERICA\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pages of Germany\\'s militaristic history are black with many shameful\\r\\ndeeds and plots. Those pages upon which are written the intrigues\\r\\nagainst the peace of America and against the lives and properties of\\r\\nAmerican citizens during the period between the declaration of war in\\r\\n1914 and the armistice ending the war, while not so bloody as those\\r\\nrelating to the atrocities in Belgium and Northern France are still\\r\\nrevolting to civilized mankind.\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany not only paid for the murder of passengers on ships where its\\r\\ninfernal machines were placed, not only conspired for the destruction of\\r\\nmunition plants and factories of many kinds, not only sought to embroil\\r\\nthe United States, then neutral, in a war with Mexico and Japan, but it\\r\\ncommitted also the crime of murderous hypocrisy by conspiring to do\\r\\nthese wrongs under the cloak of friendship for this country.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was in December of 1915 that the German Government sent to the United\\r\\nStates for general publication in American newspapers this statement:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German Government has naturally never knowingly accepted the support\\r\\nof any person, group of persons, society or organization seeking to\\r\\npromote the cause of Germany in the United States by illegal acts, by\\r\\ncounsel of violence, by contravention of law, or by any means whatever\\r\\nthat could offend the American people in the pride of their own\\r\\nauthority.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe answer to this imperial lie came from the President of the United\\r\\nStates, when, in his address to Congress, April 2, 1917, urging a\\r\\ndeclaration of war on Germany, he characterized the German spy system\\r\\nand its frightful fruits in the following language:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One of the things that has served to convince us that the Prussian\\r\\nautocracy was not and could never be our friend is that from the very\\r\\noutset of the present war it has filled our unsuspecting communities,\\r\\nand even our offices of government, with spies, and set criminal\\r\\nintrigues everywhere afoot against our national unity of counsel, our\\r\\npeace within and without, our industries and our commerce. Indeed it is\\r\\nnow evident that its spies were here even before the war began; and it\\r\\nis unhappily not a matter of conjecture, but a fact proved in our courts\\r\\nof justice, that the intrigues which have more than once come perilously\\r\\nnear to disturbing the peace and dislocating the industries of the\\r\\ncountry have been carried on at the instigation, with the support, and\\r\\neven under the personal direction of official agents of the Imperial\\r\\nGovernment accredited to the Government of the United States.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAustria co-operated with Germany in a feeble way in these plots and\\r\\npropaganda, but the master plotter was Count Johann von Bernstorff,\\r\\nGermany\\'s Ambassador. The Austro-Hungarian Ambassador, Constantin\\r\\nTheodor Dumba, Captain Franz von Papen, Captain Karl Boy-Ed, Dr.\\r\\nHeinrich F. Albert, and Wolf von Igel, all of whom were attached to the\\r\\nGerman Embassy, were associates in the intrigues. Franz von Rintelen\\r\\noperated independently and received his funds and instructions directly\\r\\nfrom Berlin.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the earliest methods of creating disorder in American munition\\r\\nplants and other industrial establishments engaged in war work was\\r\\nthrough labor disturbances. With that end in view a general German\\r\\nemployment bureau was established in August, 1915, in New York City. It\\r\\nhad branches in Philadelphia, Bridgeport, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Chicago\\r\\nand Cincinnati. These cities at that time were the centers of industries\\r\\nengaged in furnishing munitions and war supplies to the Entente allies.\\r\\nConcerning this enterprise Ambassador Dumba, writing to Baron Burian,\\r\\nForeign Minister of Austria-Hungary, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA private German employment office has been established which provides\\r\\nemployment for persons who have voluntarily given up their places, and\\r\\nit is already working well. We shall also join in and the widest support\\r\\nis assured us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe duties of men sent from the German employment offices into munition\\r\\nplants may be gathered from the following frank circular issued on\\r\\nNovember 2, 1914, by the German General Headquarters and reprinted in\\r\\nthe Freie Zeitung, of Berne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL HEADQUARTERS TO THE MILITARY REPRESENTATIVE\\r\\nON THE RUSSIAN AND FRENCH FRONTS, AS WELL AS IN ITALY AND NORWAY.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn all branch establishments of German banking houses in Sweden, Norway,\\r\\nSwitzerland, China and the United States, special military accounts have\\r\\nbeen opened for special war necessities. Main headquarters authorizes\\r\\nyou to use these credits to an unlimited extent for the purpose of\\r\\ndestroying factories, workshops, camps, and the most important centers\\r\\nof military and civil supply belonging to the enemy. In addition to the\\r\\nincitement of labor troubles, measures must be taken for the damaging of\\r\\nengines and machinery plants, the destruction of vessels carrying war\\r\\nmaterial to enemy countries, the burning of stocks of raw materials and\\r\\nfinished goods, and the depriving of large industrial centers of\\r\\nelectric power, fuel and food. Special agents, who will be placed at\\r\\nyour disposal, will supply you with the necessary means for effecting\\r\\nexplosions and fires, as well as with a list of people in the country\\r\\nunder your supervision who are willing to undertake the task of\\r\\ndestruction.\\r\\n(Signed) DR. E. FISCHER.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly after the establishment of the German employment bureau,\\r\\nAmbassador Dumba sent the following communication to the Austrian\\r\\nForeign Office:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is my impression that we can disorganize and hold up for months, if\\r\\nnot entirely prevent, the manufacture of munitions in Bethlehem and the\\r\\nMiddle West, which, in the opinion of the German military attache, is of\\r\\nimportance and amply outweighs the comparatively small expenditure of\\r\\nmoney involved.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConcerning the operations of the arson and murder squad organized by von\\r\\nBernstorff, Dumba and their associates, it is only necessary to turn to\\r\\nthe records of the criminal courts of the United States and Canada. Take\\r\\nfor example the case against Albert Kaltschmidt, living in Detroit,\\r\\nMichigan. The United States grand jury sitting in Detroit indicted\\r\\nKaltschmidt and his fellow conspirators upon the following counts:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To blow up the factory of the Peabody\\'s Company, Limited, at\\r\\nWalkerville, Ontario, ... engaged in manufacturing uniforms, clothing\\r\\nand military supplies ...\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To blow up the building known as the Windsor Armories of the City of\\r\\nWindsor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To blow up and destroy other plants and buildings in said Dominion of\\r\\nCanada, which were used for the manufacture of munitions of war,\\r\\nclothing and uniforms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To blow up and destroy the great railroad bridges of the Canadian\\r\\nPacific Railroad at Nipigon.  . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To employ and send into said Dominion of Canada spies to obtain\\r\\nmilitary information.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides the acts enumerated in the indictment it was proved upon trial\\r\\nthat Kaltschmidt and his gang planned to blow up the Detroit Screw Works\\r\\nwhere shrapnel was being manufactured, and to destroy the St. Clair\\r\\ntunnel, connecting Canada with the United States. Both of these plans\\r\\nfailed. Associated with Kaltschmidt in these plots were Captain von\\r\\nPapen, Baron Kurt von Reiswitz, German consul-general in Chicago;\\r\\nCharles F. Respa, Richard Herman, and William M. Jarasch, the latter two\\r\\nGerman reservists. Testifying in the case Jarasch, a bartender, said:\\r\\n\"Jacobsen (an aide) told me that munition factories in Canada were to be\\r\\nblown up. Before I left for Detroit, Jacobsen and I went to the\\r\\nconsulate. We saw the consul and he shook hands with me and wished me\\r\\nsuccess.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles F. Respa, in his testimony made the following revelations in\\r\\nresponse to questions by the government\\'s representatives:\\r\\n\\r\\nQ. How long had you been employed before he (Kaltschmidt) told you that\\r\\nhe wanted you to blow up some of these factories? A. About three weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ. Did Kaltschmidt at the time speak of any particular place that he\\r\\nwanted you to blow up? A. The particular place was the Armory.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ. Did he mention the Peabody Building at that time? A. Not\\r\\nparticularly--he was more after the bridges and the armories and wanted\\r\\nthose places blown up that made ammunition and military clothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ. The explosion at the armories was to be timed so that it would occur\\r\\nwhen the soldiers were asleep there? A. Yes--he did not mention that he\\r\\nwanted to kill soldiers.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ. Did he say that if the dynamite in the suitcase exploded it would\\r\\nkill the soldiers? A. I do not remember that he said so, but he must\\r\\nhave known it.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ. Did you take both grips? A. Yes. Q. Where did you set the first grip?\\r\\nA. By the Peabody plant (blown up on June 20,1915).\\r\\n\\r\\nQ. Where did you put the other suitcase? A. Then I walked down the\\r\\nWalkerville road to the Armories at Windsor, and carried the suitcase.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ. When you got to the Armories did you know where to place it? A. I had\\r\\nmy instructions.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ. From Kaltschmidt? A. Yes.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ. Did you place this suitcase containing the dynamite bomb at the\\r\\narmory in a proper place to explode and do any damage? A. Yes.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ. Was it properly connected so that the cap would explode and strike\\r\\nthe dynamite? A. I fixed it so that it would not.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ. Did you deliberately fix this bomb that you took to the Armories so\\r\\nthat it would not explode? A. Yes.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ. Why did you do that? A. I knew that the suitcase contained thirty\\r\\nsticks of dynamite and if exploded would blow up the Armories and all\\r\\nthe ammunition and kill every man in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is interesting to note in this connection that Kaltschmidt was\\r\\nsentenced to four years in the federal prison at Leavenworth, Kansas,\\r\\nand to pay a fine of $20,000. Horn\\'s sentence was eighteen months in the\\r\\nAtlanta penitentiary and a fine of $1,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nAttempts were also made to close by explosions the tunnels through which\\r\\nthe Canadian Pacific Railroad passes under the Selkirk Mountains in\\r\\nBritish Columbia. The German General Staff in this instance operated\\r\\nthrough Franz Bopp, the German consul-general in San Francisco, and\\r\\nLieutenant von Brincken. J. H. van Koolbergen was hired to do this work.\\r\\nConcerning the negotiations, van Koolbergen made this statement:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not knowing what he wanted I went to see him. He was very pleasant and\\r\\ntold me that he was an officer in the German army and at present working\\r\\nin the secret service of the German Empire under Mr. Franz Bopp, the\\r\\nImperial German consul.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I went to the consulate and met Franz Bopp and then saw von Brincken in\\r\\nanother room. He asked me if I would do something for him in Canada and\\r\\nI answered him, \\'Sure, I will do something, even blow up bridges, if\\r\\nthere is money in it.\\' And he said, \\'You are the man; if that is so, you\\r\\ncan make good money.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Von Brincken told me that they were willing to send me up to Canada to\\r\\nblow up one of the bridges on the Canadian Pacific Railroad or one of\\r\\nthe tunnels. I asked him what was in it and he said he would talk it\\r\\nover with the German consul, Bopp.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had accepted von Brincken\\'s proposition to go to Canada and he\\r\\noffered me $500 to defray my expenses. On different occasions, in his\\r\\nroom, von Brincken showed me maps and information about Canada, and\\r\\npointed out to me where he wanted the act to be done. This was to be\\r\\nbetween Revelstake and Vancouver on the Canadian Pacific Railroad, and I\\r\\nwas to get $3,000 in case of a successful blowing up of a military\\r\\nbridge or tunnel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nVan Koolbergen only made a pretended effort to blow up the tunnel. He\\r\\ndid furnish the evidence, however, which served to send Bopp and his\\r\\nassociates to the penitentiary.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven more sensational was the plot against the international bridge upon\\r\\nwhich the Grand Trunk Railway crosses the border between the United\\r\\nStates and Canada at Vanceboro, Me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWerner Horn was a German reserve lieutenant. Von Papen delivered to him\\r\\na flat order to blow up the bridge and he gave him $700 for the purpose\\r\\nof perpetrating the outrage. Horn was partially successful. At his trial\\r\\nin Boston in June, 1917, he made the following confession:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I admit and state that the facts set forth in the indictments as to the\\r\\nconveyance of explosives on certain passenger trains from New York to\\r\\nBoston and from Boston to Vanceboro, in the State of Maine, are true. I\\r\\ndid, as therein alleged, receive an explosive and conveyed the same from\\r\\nthe city of New York to Boston, thence by common carrier from Boston to\\r\\nVanceboro, Maine. On or about the night of February 1, 1915, I took said\\r\\nexplosive in a suitcase in which I was conveying it and carried the same\\r\\nacross the bridge at Vanceboro to the Canadian side, and there, about\\r\\n1.10 in the morning of February 2, 1915, I caused said explosive to be\\r\\nexploded near or against the abutments of the bridge on the Canadian\\r\\nside, with intent to destroy the abutment and cripple the bridge so that\\r\\nthe same could not be used for the passage of trains.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBribery of Congressmen was intended by Franz von Rintelen, operating\\r\\ndirectly in touch with the German Foreign Office in Berlin. Count von\\r\\nBernstorff sent the following telegram to Berlin in connection with his\\r\\nplan:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI request authority to pay out up to $50,000 in order, as on former\\r\\noccasions, to influence Congress through the organization you know of,\\r\\nwhich can perhaps prevent war. I am beginning in the meantime to act\\r\\naccordingly. In the above circumstances, a public official German\\r\\ndeclaration in favor of Ireland is highly desirable, in order to gain\\r\\nthe support of the Irish influence here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThat it was Rintelen\\'s purpose to use large sums of money for the\\r\\npurpose of bribing Congressmen was stated positively by George Plochman,\\r\\ntreasurer of the Transatlantic Trust Company, where Rintelen kept his\\r\\ndeposits.\\r\\n\\r\\nRintelen was the main figure on this side of the water in the fantastic\\r\\nplot to have Mexico and Japan declare war upon the United States. During\\r\\nthe trial of Rintelen in New York City in May, 1917, it was testified\\r\\n\"that he came to the United States in order to embroil it with Mexico\\r\\nand Japan if necessary; that he was doing all he could and was going to\\r\\ndo all he could to embroil this country with Mexico; that he believed\\r\\nthat if the United States had a war with Mexico it would stop the\\r\\nshipment of ammunition to Europe; that he believed it would be only a\\r\\nmatter of time until we were involved with Japan.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRintelen also said that \"General Huerta was going to return to Mexico\\r\\nand start a revolution there which would cause the United States to\\r\\nintervene and so make it impossible to ship munitions to Europe.\\r\\nIntervention,\" he said, \"was one of his trump cards.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMexico was the happy hunting-ground for pro-German plotters, and the\\r\\nGerman Ambassador in Mexico, Heinrich von Eckhardt, was the leader in\\r\\nall the intrigues. The culmination of Germany\\'s effort against America\\r\\non this continent came on January 19, 1917, when Dr. Alfred Zimmerman,\\r\\nhead of the German Foreign Office, sent the following cable to\\r\\nAmbassador von Eckhardt:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the first of February we intend to begin submarine warfare\\r\\nunrestricted. In spite of this, it is our intention to endeavor to keep\\r\\nneutral the United States of America.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf this attempt is not successful, we propose an alliance on the\\r\\nfollowing basis with Mexico: That we shall make war together and\\r\\ntogether make peace. We shall give general financial support, and it is\\r\\nunderstood that Mexico is to reconquer the lost territory in New Mexico,\\r\\nTexas and Arizona. The details are left to you for settlement. You are\\r\\ninstructed to inform the President of Mexico of the above in the\\r\\ngreatest confidence as soon as it is certain that there will be an\\r\\noutbreak of war with the United States, and suggest that the President\\r\\nof Mexico, on his own initiative, should communicate with Japan\\r\\nsuggesting adherence at once to this plan; at the same time, offer to\\r\\nmediate between Germany and Japan.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease call to the attention of the President of Mexico that the\\r\\nemployment of ruthless submarine warfare now promises to compel England\\r\\nto make peace in a few months.\\r\\nZIMMERMAN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was almost three months before the United States entered the war.\\r\\nAs an example of German blindness and diplomatic folly it stands\\r\\nunrivaled in the annals of the German Foreign Office.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlots against shipping were the deadliest in which the German\\r\\nconspirators engaged. Death and destruction followed in their wake. In\\r\\ndirect connection of von Bernstorff and his tools with these outrages\\r\\nthe following testimony by an American secret service man employed by\\r\\nWolf von Igel is interesting. It refers to an appointment with Captain\\r\\nvon Kleist, superintendent of Scheele\\'s bomb factory in Hoboken, N. J.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We sat down and we spoke for about three hours. I asked him the\\r\\ndifferent things that he did, and said if he wanted an interview with\\r\\nMr. von Igel, my boss, he would have to tell everything. So he told me\\r\\nthat von Papen gave Dr. Scheele, the partner of von Kleist in this\\r\\nfactory, a check for $10,000 to start this bomb factory. He told me that\\r\\nhe, Mr. von Kleist, and Dr. Scheele and a man by the name of Becker on\\r\\nthe Friedrich der Grosse were making the bombs, and that Captain\\r\\nWolpert, Captain Bode and Captain Steinberg, had charge of putting these\\r\\nbombs on the ships; they put these bombs in cases and shipped them as\\r\\nmerchandise on these steamers, and they would go away on the trip and\\r\\nthe bombs would go off after the ship was out four or five days, causing\\r\\na fire and causing the cargo to go up in flames. He also told me that\\r\\nthey have made quite a number of these bombs; that thirty of them were\\r\\ngiven to a party by the name of O\\'Leary, and that he took them down to\\r\\nNew Orleans where he had charge of putting them on ships down there,\\r\\nthis fellow O\\'Leary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout four hundred bombs were made under von Igel\\'s direction;\\r\\nexplosions and fires were caused by them on thirty-three ships sailing\\r\\nfrom New York harbor alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour of the bombs were found at Marseilles on a vessel which sailed from\\r\\nBrooklyn in May, 1915. The evidence collected in the case led to the\\r\\nindictment of the following men for feloniously transporting on the\\r\\nsteamship Kirk Oswald a bomb or bombs filled with chemicals designed to\\r\\ncause incendiary fires: Rintelen, Wolpert, Bode, Schmidt, Becker,\\r\\nGarbade, Praedel, Paradies, von Kleist, Schimmel, Scheele, Steinberg and\\r\\nothers. The last three named fled from justice, Scheele being supplied\\r\\nwith $1,000 for that purpose by Wolf von Igel. He eluded the Federal\\r\\nauthorities until April, 1918, when he was found hiding in Cuba under\\r\\nthe protection of German secret service agents. All the others except\\r\\nSchmidt were found guilty and sentenced, on February 5, 1918, to\\r\\nimprisonment for eighteen months and payment of a fine of $2,000 each.\\r\\nIt was proved during the trial that Rintelen had hired Schimmel, a\\r\\nGerman lawyer, to see that bombs were placed on ships.\\r\\n\\r\\nSchmidt, von Kleist, Becker, Garbade, Praedel and Paradies had already\\r\\nbeen tried for conspiracy to make bombs for concealment on ocean-going\\r\\nvessels, with the purpose of setting the same on fire. All were found\\r\\nguilty, and on April 6, 1917, von Kleist and Schmidt were sentenced to\\r\\ntwo years imprisonment and a fine of $500 each.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert Fay, a former officer in the German army, who came to the United\\r\\nStates in April, 1915, endeavored to prevent the traffic in munitions by\\r\\nsinking the laden ships at sea. In recounting the circumstances of his\\r\\narrival here to the chief of the United States secret service, Fay said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\". . .I had in the neighborhood of $4,000.... This money came from a man\\r\\nwho sent me over ... (named) Jonnersen. The understanding was that it\\r\\nmight be worth while to stop the shipment of artillery munitions from\\r\\nthis country. . . . I imagined Jonnersen to be in the (German) secret\\r\\nservice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter stating that he saw von Papen and Boy-Ed, and that neither would\\r\\nhave anything to do with him, apparently because suspicious of his\\r\\nidentity, Fay continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not want to return (to Germany) without having carried out my\\r\\nintention, that is, the destruction of ships carrying munitions. I\\r\\nproceeded with my experiments and tried to get hold of as much explosive\\r\\nmatter as in any way possible. . . .\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFay and two confederates were arrested in a lonely spot near Grantwood,\\r\\nNew Jersey, while testing an explosive. During his examination at police\\r\\nheadquarters in Weehawken immediately after the arrest he was questioned\\r\\nas follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nQ. That large machine you have downstairs, what is that?\\r\\n\\r\\nA. That is a patent of mine. It is a new way of getting a time fuse. ...\\r\\n\\r\\nQ. Did you know where Scholz (Fay\\'s brother-in-law) had this machine\\r\\nmade?\\r\\n\\r\\nA. In different machine shops.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ. What material is it you wanted (from Daeche, an accomplice)?\\r\\n\\r\\nA. Trinitrotoluol (T. N. T.). ...\\r\\n\\r\\nQ. How much did the machinery cost?\\r\\n\\r\\nA. Roughly speaking, $150 or $200.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ. What would be the cost of making one and filling it with explosives?\\r\\n\\r\\nA. About $250 each ... If they had given me money enough I should simply\\r\\nhave been able to block the shipping entirely.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ. Do you mean you could have destroyed every ship that left the harbor\\r\\nby means of those bombs?\\r\\n\\r\\nA. I would have been able to stop so many that the authorities would not\\r\\nhave dared (to send out any ships).\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was proved during Fay\\'s trial that his bomb was a practical device,\\r\\nand that its forty pounds of explosive would sink any ship to which it\\r\\nwas attached.\\r\\n\\r\\nFay and his accomplices, Scholz and Daeche, were convicted of conspiracy\\r\\nto attach explosive bombs to the rudders of vessels, with the intention\\r\\nof wrecking the same when at sea, and were sentenced, on May 9, 1916, to\\r\\nterms of eight, four and two years respectively, in the federal\\r\\npenitentiary at Atlanta. Dr. Herbert Kienzle and Max Breitung, who\\r\\nassisted Fay in procuring explosives, were indicted on the same charge.\\r\\nBoth were interned.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother plan for disabling ships was suggested by a man who remained for\\r\\nsome time unknown. He called one day at the German Military Information\\r\\nBureau, maintained at 60 Wall Street by Captain von Papen, of the German\\r\\nembassy, and there gave the following outline of his plan:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I intend to cause serious damage to vessels of the Allies leaving ports\\r\\nof the United States by placing bombs, which I am making myself, on\\r\\nboard. These bombs resemble ordinary lumps of coal and I am planning to\\r\\nhave them concealed in the coal to be laden on steamers of the Allies. I\\r\\nhave already discussed this plan with ... at ... and he thinks favorably\\r\\nof my idea. I have been engaged on similar work in ... after the outbreak\\r\\nof the war, together with Mr. von ...\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Painting]\\r\\n  WOMEN AT WORK THAT MEN MAY FIGHT\\r\\n  The women of the world took up quickly almost every masculine task in\\r\\n  industry to release their menfolk for the firing line. They were\\r\\n  especially valuable in the munitions factories of England, as shown\\r\\n  above.

BAKHMETEFF, care Imperial Russian Embassy, Newport, R. I.: DEAR\\r\\nMADAM:--By direction of the Imperial Russian Consul-General of San\\r\\nFrancisco, I beg to submit the following on behalf of several\\r\\nfruit-growers of the State of California. As it is the wish of certain\\r\\ngrowers to contribute several tons of dried fruit to the Russian Red\\r\\nCross they desire to have arrangements made to facilitate the\\r\\ntransportation of this fruit from Tacoma, Washington, to Vladivostok,\\r\\nand as we are advised that steamships are regularly plying between\\r\\nTacoma and Vladivostok upon which government supplies are shipped we\\r\\nwould like to have arrangements made that these fruits as they might\\r\\narrive would be regularly consigned to these steamers and forwarded. It\\r\\nwould be necessary, therefore, that an understanding be had with the\\r\\nagents of these steamship lines at Tacoma that immediate shipments be\\r\\nmade via whatever steamers might be sailing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the desire of the donors that there be no delay in the shipments\\r\\nas delays would lessen the benefits intended to those for whom the fruit\\r\\nwas provided ....\\r\\nRespectfully yours,\\r\\nC. C. CROWLEY.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe statements of Louis J. Smith and van Koolbergen, combined with a\\r\\nmass of other evidence consisting in part of letters and telegrams,\\r\\ncaused the grand jury to indict Consul-General Bopp, his staff and his\\r\\nhired agents, for conspiracy to undertake a military enterprise against\\r\\nCanada. Among the purposes of this enterprise specified in the\\r\\nindictment was the following:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To blow up and destroy with their cargoes and crews any and all vessels\\r\\nbelonging to Great Britain, France, Japan or Russia found within the\\r\\nlimits of Canada, which were laden with horses, munitions of war, or\\r\\narticles of commerce in course of transportation to the above\\r\\ncountries....\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following descriptions have been made by the United States\\r\\nGovernment of the tools of von Bernstorff in German plots:\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul Koenig, the head of the Hamburg-American secret service, who was\\r\\nactive in passport frauds, who induced Gustave Stahl to perjure himself\\r\\nand declare the Lusitania armed, and who plotted the destruction of the\\r\\nWelland Canal. In his work as a spy he passed under thirteen aliases in\\r\\nthis country and Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptains Boy-Ed, von Papen, von Rintelen, Tauscher, and von Igel were\\r\\nall directly connected with the German Government itself. There is now\\r\\nin the possession of the United States Government a check made out to\\r\\nKoenig and signed by von Papen, identified by number in a secret report\\r\\nof the German Bureau of Investigation as being used to procure $150 for\\r\\nthe payment of a bomb-maker, who was to plant explosives disguised as\\r\\ncoal in the bunkers of the merchant vessels clearing from the port of\\r\\nNew York. Boy-Ed, Dr. Bunz, the German ex-minister to Mexico, the German\\r\\nconsul at San Francisco, and officials of the Hamburg-American and North\\r\\nGerman Lloyd steamship lines evaded customs regulations and coaled and\\r\\nvictualed German raiders at sea. Von Papen and von Igel supervised the\\r\\nmaking of the incendiary bombs on the Friedrich der Grosse, then in New\\r\\nYork Harbor, and stowed them away on outgoing ships. Von Rintelen\\r\\nfinanced Labor\\'s National Peace Council, which tried to corrupt\\r\\nlegislators and labor leaders.\\r\\n\\r\\nA lesser light of this galaxy was Robert Fay, who invented an explosive\\r\\ncontrivance which he tied to the rudder posts of vessels. According to\\r\\nhis confession and that of his partner in murder, the money came from\\r\\nthe German secret police.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the other tools of the German plotters were David Lamar and Henry\\r\\nMartin, who, in the pay of Captain von Rintelen, organized and managed\\r\\nthe so-called Labor\\'s National Peace Council, which sought to bring\\r\\nabout strikes, an embargo on munitions, and a boycott of the banks which\\r\\nsubscribed to the Anglo-French loan. A check for $5,000 to J. F. J.\\r\\nArchibald for propaganda work, and a receipt from Edwin Emerson, the war\\r\\ncorrespondent, for $1,000 traveling expenses were among the documents\\r\\nfound in Wolf von Igel\\'s possession.\\r\\n\\r\\nOthers who bore English names were persuaded to take leading places in\\r\\nsimilar organizations which concealed their origin and real purpose. The\\r\\nAmerican Embargo Conference arose out of the ashes of Labor\\'s Peace\\r\\nCouncil, and its president was American, though the funds were not.\\r\\nOthers tampered with were journalists who lent themselves to the German\\r\\npropaganda and who went so far as to serve as couriers between the\\r\\nTeutonic embassies in Washington and the governments in Berlin and\\r\\nVienna. A check of $5,000 was discovered which Count von Bernstorff had\\r\\nsent to Marcus Braun, editor of Fair Play. And a letter was discovered\\r\\nwhich George Sylvester Viereck, editor of the Fatherland, sent to Privy\\r\\nCouncilor Albert, the German agent, arranging for a monthly subsidy of\\r\\n$1,750, to be delivered to him through the hands of\\r\\nintermediaries--women whose names he abbreviates \"to prevent any\\r\\npossible inquiry.\" There is a record of $3,000 paid through the German\\r\\nembassy to finance the lecture tour of Miss Ray Beveridge, an American\\r\\nartist, who was further to be supplied with German war pictures.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German propagandists also directed their efforts to poisoning the\\r\\nminds of the people through the circulation of lies concerning affairs\\r\\nin France and at home. Here are some of the rumors circulated throughout\\r\\nthe country that were nailed as falsehoods:\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was said that the national registration of women by the Food\\r\\nAdministration was to find out how much money each had in the bank, how\\r\\nmuch of this was owed, and everything about each registrant\\'s personal\\r\\naffairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat the millions collected from the public for the Red Cross went into\\r\\nthe pockets of thieves, and that the soldiers and sailors got none of\\r\\nit, nor any of its benefits.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat base hospital units had been annihilated while en route overseas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat leading members of other hospital units had been executed as spies\\r\\nby the American Government.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat canned goods put up by the housewives were to be seized by the\\r\\ngovernment and appropriated to the use of the army and navy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat soldiers in training were being instructed to put out the eyes of\\r\\nevery German captured.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat all of the \"plums\" at the officers\\' training camps fell to Roman\\r\\nCatholics. The plums went to Protestants when the propagandist talked to\\r\\na Catholic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat the registration of women was held so that girls would be enticed\\r\\ninto the cities where white slaves were made of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat the battleship Pennsylvania had been destroyed with everyone on\\r\\nboard by a German submarine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat more than seventy-five per cent of the American soldiers in France\\r\\nhad been infected with venereal diseases.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat intoxicants were given freely to American soldiers in Y. M. C. A.\\r\\nand Knights of Columbus huts in France.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the lies and the plots failed to make any impression on the morale\\r\\nof American citizenry. In fact, America from the moment war was declared\\r\\nagainst Germany until the time an armistice was declared, seemed to care\\r\\nfor nothing but results. Charges of graft made with bitter invective in\\r\\nCongress created scarcely more than a ripple. The harder the pro-German\\r\\nplotters worked for the destruction of property and the incitement to\\r\\nlabor disturbances, the closer became the protective network of\\r\\nAmericanism against these anti-war influences. After half a dozen German\\r\\nlies had been casually passed from mouth to mouth as rumors; the\\r\\nAmerican people came to look upon other mischievous propaganda in its\\r\\ntrue light. Patriotic newspapers in every community exposed the false\\r\\nreports and citizens everywhere were on their guard against the\\r\\nmisstatements. It was noticeable that the propaganda was intensified\\r\\njust previous to and during the several Liberty Loan campaigns. Proof\\r\\nthat the American spirit rises superior to anti-American influences is\\r\\nfurnished by the glorious records of these Liberty Loans. Every one was\\r\\nover-subscribed despite the severest handicaps confronted by any nation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVI\\r\\n\\r\\nSINKING OF THE LUSITANIA\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States was brought face to face with the Great War and with\\r\\nwhat it meant in ruthless destruction of life when, on May 7, 1915, the\\r\\ncrack Cunard Liner Lusitania, bound from New York to Liverpool, with\\r\\n1,959 persons aboard, was torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine off\\r\\nOld Head of Kinsale, Southwestern Ireland. Two torpedoes reached their\\r\\nmark. The total number of lives lost when the ship sunk was 1,198. Of\\r\\nthese 755 were passengers and the remainder were members of the crew. Of\\r\\nthe drowned passengers, 124 were Americans and 35 were infants.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Remember the Lusitania!\" later became a battlecry just as \"Remember the\\r\\nMaine!\" acted as a spur to Americans during the war with Spain. It was\\r\\nfirst used by the famous \"Black Watch\" and later American troops shouted\\r\\nit as they went into battle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sinking of the Lusitania, with its attendant destruction of life,\\r\\nsent a thrill of horror through the neutral peoples of the world.\\r\\nGeneral opposition to the use of submarines in attacking peaceful\\r\\nshipping, especially passenger vessels, crystallized as the result of\\r\\nthe tragedy, and a critical diplomatic controversy between the United\\r\\nStates and Germany developed. The American Government signified its\\r\\ndetermination to break off friendly relations with the German Empire\\r\\nunless the ruthless practices of the submarine commanders were\\r\\nterminated. Germany temporarily agreed to discontinue these practices.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the victims of the Cunarder\\'s destruction were some of the best\\r\\nknown personages of the Western Hemisphere. Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt,\\r\\nmultimillionaire; Charles Frohman, noted theatrical manager; Charles\\r\\nKlein, dramatist, who wrote \"The Lion and the Mouse;\" Justus Miles\\r\\nForman, author, and Elbert Hubbard, known as Fra Elbertus, widely read\\r\\niconoclastic writer, were drowned.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ocean off the pleasant southern coast of Ireland was dotted with\\r\\nbodies for days after the sinking of the liner. The remains of many of\\r\\nthe victims, however, never were recovered.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Lusitania prepared to sail from New York on her last trip,\\r\\nfifty anonymous telegrams addressed to prominent persons aboard the\\r\\nvessel warned the recipients not to sail with the liner. In addition to\\r\\nthese warnings was an advertisement inserted in the leading metropolitan\\r\\nnewspapers by the German embassy, advising neutral persons that British\\r\\nsteamships were in danger of destruction in the war zone about the\\r\\nBritish Isles. This notice appeared the day the Lusitania sailed, May\\r\\n1st, and was placed next the advertisement of the Cunard Line. Following\\r\\nis the advertisement:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTICE!\\r\\nTravelers intending to embark on the Atlantic voyage are reminded that a\\r\\nstate of war exists between Germany and her allies and Great Britain and\\r\\nher allies; that the zone of war includes the waters adjacent to the\\r\\nBritish Isles; that, in accordance with formal notice given by the\\r\\nImperial German Government, vessels flying the flag of Great Britain, or\\r\\nof any of her allies, are liable to destruction in those waters and that\\r\\ntravelers sailing in the war zone on ships of Great Britain or her\\r\\nallies do so at their own risk.\\r\\nImperial German Embassy,\\r\\nWashington, D. C., April 22, 1915.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle or no attention was paid to the warnings, only the usual number\\r\\nof persons canceling their reservations, The general agent of the Cunard\\r\\nLine at New York assured the passengers that the Lusitania\\'s voyage\\r\\nwould be attended by no risk whatever, referring to the liner\\'s speed\\r\\nand water-tight compartments.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the great Cunarder drew near the scene of her disaster, traveling at\\r\\nmoderate speed along her accustomed route, there was news of freight\\r\\nsteamers falling victims to Germany\\'s undersea campaign. It was not\\r\\ndefinitely established, however, whether the liner was warned of danger.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt two o\\'clock on the fine afternoon of May 7th, some ten miles off the\\r\\nOld Head of Kinsale, the Lusitania was sighted by a submarine 1,000\\r\\nyards away. A second later the track of a torpedo, soon followed by\\r\\nanother, was seen and each missile crashed into the Lusitania\\'s hull\\r\\nwith rending detonations.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany were killed or injured immediately by the explosions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the liner\\'s headway was lost, some boats were lowered, and\\r\\ncapsized as a result. The immediate listing of the steamship added to\\r\\nthe difficulties of rescue and increased the tragical toll of dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch heroism and calmness were displayed by many in the few minutes the\\r\\nliner remained afloat. The bearing of Frohman, Vanderbilt, Hubbard and\\r\\nother Americans was declared to have been particularly inspiring.\\r\\n\\r\\nRescue ships and naval vessels rushed to the aid of the survivors from\\r\\nall nearby ports of Ireland.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been said that the sinking of the Lusitania was carefully planned\\r\\nby the chiefs of the German admiralty. They expected, it was believed,\\r\\nto demoralize British shipping and strike terror into the minds of the\\r\\nBritish people by showing that the largest and swiftest of liners could\\r\\neasily be destroyed by submarines.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Paris paper, La Guerre Sociale, published by Gustave\\r\\nHerve, the submarine responsible was the U-21, commanded by Lieutenant\\r\\nHersing. Hersing was said to have been decorated for his deed. The U-21\\r\\nafterwards was destroyed and the story of its participation in the\\r\\nsinking of the great Cunarder never was confirmed.\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately upon the news of the Lusitania disaster, President Wilson\\r\\ntook steps to hold Germany to that \"strict accountability\" of which he\\r\\nhad notified Berlin when the war-zone operations were begun earlier in\\r\\nthe year. His first communication, protesting against the sinking of the\\r\\nliner in the name of humanity and demanding disavowal, indemnity and\\r\\nassurance that the crime would not be repeated, was despatched on May\\r\\n13th. On May 30th the German reply argued that the liner carried\\r\\nmunitions of war and probably was armed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following official German version of the incident by the German\\r\\nAdmiralty Staff over the signature of Admiral Behncke was given:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The submarine sighted the steamer, which showed no flag, May 7th, at\\r\\n2.20 o\\'clock, Central European time, afternoon, on the southeast coast\\r\\nof Ireland, in fine, clear weather.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At 3.10 o\\'clock one torpedo was fired at the Lusitania, which hit her\\r\\nstarboard side below the captain\\'s bridge. The detonation of the torpedo\\r\\nwas followed immediately by a further explosion of extremely strong\\r\\neffect. The ship quickly listed to starboard and began to sink.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The second explosion must be traced back to the ignition of quantities\\r\\nof ammunition inside the ship.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese extenuations were all rejected by the United States, and the next\\r\\nnote prepared by President Wilson was of such character that Secretary\\r\\nof State Bryan resigned. This second communication was sent on June\\r\\n11th, and on June 22d another was cabled. September 1st Germany accepted\\r\\nthe contentions of the United States in regard to submarine warfare upon\\r\\npeaceful shipping. There were continued negotiations concerning the\\r\\nspecific settlement to be made in the case of the Lusitania.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 4th, 1916, arrived a German proposition which, coupled with\\r\\npersonal parleys carried on between German Ambassador von Bernstorff and\\r\\nUnited States Secretary of State Lansing, seemed in a fair way to\\r\\nconclude the whole controversy. It was announced on February 8th that\\r\\nthe two nations were in substantial accord and Germany was declared to\\r\\nhave admitted the sinking of the liner was wrong and unjustified and\\r\\npromised that reparation would be made.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, a week later, when Germany took advantage of tentative American\\r\\nproposals concerning the disarming of merchant ships, by announcing that\\r\\nall armed hostile merchantmen would be treated as warships and attacked\\r\\nwithout warning, the almost completed agreement was overthrown. The\\r\\nrenewed negotiations were continuing when the torpedoing of the\\r\\ncross-channel passenger ship Sussex, without warning, on March 24th,\\r\\nimpelled the United States to issue a virtual ultimatum, demanding that\\r\\nthe Germans immediately cease their present methods of naval warfare on\\r\\npain of the rupture of diplomatic relations with the most powerful\\r\\nexisting neutral nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lusitania, previous to her sinking, had figured in the war news,\\r\\nfirst at the conflict, when it was feared she had been captured by a\\r\\nGerman cruiser while she was dashing across the Atlantic toward\\r\\nLiverpool, and again in February of 1915, when she flew the American\\r\\nflag as a ruse to deceive submarines while crossing the Irish Sea. This\\r\\nlatter incident called forth a protest from the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn her fatal trip the cargo of the Lusitania was worth $735,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a great transatlantic liner, the Lusitania was a product of the race\\r\\nfor speed, which was carried on for years among larger steamship\\r\\ncompanies, particularly of England and Germany. When the Lusitania was\\r\\nlaunched, it was the wonder of the maritime world. Its mastery of the\\r\\nsea, from the standpoint of speed, was undisputed.\\r\\n\\r\\nProgress of the Lusitania on its first voyage to New York, September 7,\\r\\n1907, was watched by the world. The vessel made the voyage in five days\\r\\nand fifty-four minutes, at that time a record. Its fastest trip, made on\\r\\nthe western voyage, was four days eleven hours forty-two minutes. This\\r\\nrecord, however, was wrested from it subsequently by the Mauretania, a\\r\\nsister ship, which set the mark of four days ten hours forty-one\\r\\nminutes, that still stands.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the Lusitania was surpassed in size by several other liners\\r\\nbuilt subsequently, it never lost the reputation acquired at the outset\\r\\nof its career. Its speed and luxurious accommodations made it a\\r\\nfavorite, and its passenger lists bore the names of many of the most\\r\\nprominent Atlantic wayfarers. The vessel was pronounced by its builders\\r\\nto be as nearly unsinkable as any ship could be.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything about the Lusitania was of colossal dimensions.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer rudder weighed sixty-five tons. She carried three anchors of ten\\r\\ntons each. The main frames and beams, placed end to end, would extend\\r\\nthirty miles. The Lusitania was 785 feet long, 88 feet beam, and 60 feet\\r\\ndeep. Her gross tonnage was 32,500 and her net tonnage, 9,145.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharges were made that one or more guardian submarines deliberately\\r\\ndrove off ships nearby which might have saved hundreds of lives lost\\r\\nwhen the Lusitania went down. Captain W. F. Wood, of the Leyland Line\\r\\nsteamer Etonian, said his ship was prevented from going to the rescue of\\r\\nthe passengers of the sinking Lusitania by a warning that an attack\\r\\nmight be made upon his own vessel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Etonian left Liverpool, May 6th. When Captain Wood was forty-two\\r\\nmiles from Kinsale he received a wireless call from the Lusitania for\\r\\nimmediate assistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe call was also picked up by the steamers City of Exeter and\\r\\nNarragansett. The Narragansett, Captain Wood said, was made a target for\\r\\nsubmarine attack, a torpedo missing her by a few feet, and her commander\\r\\nthen warned Captain Wood not to attempt to reach the Lusitania.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was two o\\'clock in the afternoon, May 7th, that we received the\\r\\nwireless S O S,\" said Captain Wood. \"I was then forty-two miles distant\\r\\nfrom the position he gave me. The Narragansett and the City of Exeter\\r\\nwere nearer the Lusitania and she answered the SOS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At five o\\'clock I observed the City of Exeter cross our bows and she\\r\\nsignaled, \\'Have you heard anything of the disaster?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At that moment I saw a periscope of a submarine between the Tonina and\\r\\nthe City of Exeter, about a quarter of a mile directly ahead of us. She\\r\\ndived as soon as she saw us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I signaled to the engine room for every available inch of speed. Then\\r\\nwe saw the submarine come up astern of us. I now ordered full speed\\r\\nahead and we left the submarine behind. The periscope remained in sight\\r\\nabout twenty minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No sooner had we lost sight of the submarine astern, than another\\r\\nappeared on the starboard bow. This one was directly ahead and on the\\r\\nsurface, not submerged.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I starboarded hard away from him, he swinging as we did. About eight\\r\\nminutes later he submerged. I continued at top speed for four hours and\\r\\nsaw no more of the submarines. It was the ship\\'s speed that saved her,\\r\\nthat\\'s all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Narragansett, as soon as she heard the S O S call, went to the\\r\\nassistance of the Lusitania. One of the submarines discharged a torpedo\\r\\nat her and missed her by not more than eight feet. The Narragansett then\\r\\nwarned us not to attempt to go to the rescue, and I got her wireless\\r\\ncall while I was dodging the two submarines. You can see that three\\r\\nships would have gone to the assistance of the Lusitania had they not\\r\\nbeen attacked by the two submarines.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German Government defended the brutal destruction of non-combatants\\r\\nby the false assertions that the Lusitania was an armed vessel and that\\r\\nit was carrying a great store of munitions. Both of these accusations\\r\\nwere proved to be mere fabrications. The Lusitania was absolutely\\r\\nunarmed and the nearest approach to munitions was a consignment of 1,250\\r\\nempty shell cases and 4,200 cases of cartridges for small arms.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntense indignation swept over the neutral world, the tide rising\\r\\nhighest in America. It well may be said that the destruction of the\\r\\nLusitania was one of the greatest factors in driving America into the\\r\\nwar with Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\nConcerning the charge that the Lusitania carried munitions, Dudley Field\\r\\nMalone, Collector of the port of New York, testified that he made\\r\\npersonal and close inspection of the ship\\'s cargo and saw that it\\r\\ncarried no guns and that there were no munitions in its cargo.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis statement follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This report is not correct. The Lusitania was inspected before sailing,\\r\\nas is customary. No guns were found, mounted or unmounted, and the\\r\\nvessel sailed without any armament. No merchant ship would be allowed to\\r\\narm in this port and leave the harbor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain W. T. Turner, of the Lusitania, testifying before the coroner\\'s\\r\\ninquest at Kinsale, Ireland, was interrogated as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You were aware threats had been made that the ship would be torpedoed?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We were,\" the Captain replied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Was she armed?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What precautions did you take?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We had all the boats swung when we came within the danger zone, between\\r\\nthe passing of Fastnet and the time of the accident.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coroner asked him whether he had received a message concerning the\\r\\nsinking of a ship off Kinsale by a submarine. Captain Turner replied\\r\\nthat he had not.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you receive any special instructions as to the voyage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you at liberty to tell us what they were?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you carry them out?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, to the best of my ability.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell us in your own words what happened after passing Fastnet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The weather was clear,\" Captain Turner answered. \"We were going at a\\r\\nspeed of eighteen knots. I was on the port side and heard Second Officer\\r\\nHefford call out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Here\\'s a torpedo!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I ran to the other side and saw clearly the wake of a torpedo. Smoke\\r\\nand steam came up between the last two funnels. There was a slight\\r\\nshock. Immediately after the first explosion there was another report,\\r\\nbut that may possibly have been internal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I at once gave the order to lower the boats down to the rails, and I\\r\\ndirected that women and children should get into them. I also had all\\r\\nthe bulkheads closed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Between the time of passing Fastnet, about 11 o\\'clock, and of the\\r\\ntorpedoing I saw no sign whatever of any submarines. There was some haze\\r\\nalong the Irish coast, and when we were near Fastnet I slowed down to\\r\\nfifteen knots. I was in wireless communication with shore all the way\\r\\nacross.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Turner was asked whether he had received any message in regard\\r\\nto the presence of submarines off the Irish coast. He replied in the\\r\\naffirmative. Questioned regarding the nature of the message, he replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I respectfully refer you to the admiralty for an answer.\" \"I also gave\\r\\norders to stop the ship,\" Captain Turner continued, \"but we could not\\r\\nstop. We found that the engines were out of commission. It was not safe\\r\\nto lower boats until the speed was off the vessel. As a matter of fact,\\r\\nthere was a perceptible headway on her up to the time she went down.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When she was struck she listed to starboard. I stood on the bridge when\\r\\nshe sank, and the Lusitania went down under me. She floated about\\r\\neighteen minutes after the torpedo struck her. My watch stopped at 2.36.\\r\\nI was picked up from among the wreckage and afterward was brought aboard\\r\\na trawler.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No warship was convoying us. I saw no warship, and none was reported to\\r\\nme as having been seen. At the time I was picked up I noticed bodies\\r\\nfloating on the surface, but saw no living persons.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Eighteen knots was not the normal speed of the Lusitania, was it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At ordinary times,\" answered Captain Turner, \"she could make\\r\\ntwenty-five knots, but in war times her speed was reduced to twenty-one\\r\\nknots. My reason for going eighteen knots was that I wanted to arrive at\\r\\nLiverpool bar without stopping, and within two or three hours of high\\r\\nwater.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Was there a lookout kept for submarines, having regard to previous\\r\\nwarnings?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, we had double lookouts.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Were you going a zigzag course at the moment the torpedoing took\\r\\nplace?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No. It was bright weather, and land was clearly visible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Was it possible for a submarine to approach without being seen?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes; quite possible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Something has been said regarding the impossibility of launching the\\r\\nboats on the port side?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Captain Turner, \"owing to the listing of the ship.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How many boats were launched safely?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Were any launched safely?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and one or two on the port side.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Were your orders promptly carried out?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Was there any panic on board?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, there was no panic at all. It was almost calm.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How many persons were on board?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There were 1,500 passengers and about 600 crew.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the Foreman of the Jury--\"In the face of the warnings at New York\\r\\nthat the Lusitania would be torpedoed, did you make any application to\\r\\nthe admiralty for an escort?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I left that to them. It is their business, not mine. I simply had\\r\\nto carry out my orders to go, and I would do it again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Turner uttered the last words of this reply with great emphasis.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the Coroner--\"I am glad to hear you say so, Captain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the Juryman--\"Did you get a wireless to steer your vessel in a\\r\\nnorthern direction?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" replied Captain Turner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Was the course of the vessel altered after the torpedoes struck her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I headed straight for land, but it was useless. Previous to this the\\r\\nwatertight bulkheads were closed. I suppose the explosion forced them\\r\\nopen. I don\\'t know the exact extent to which the Lusitania was damaged.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There must have been serious damage done to the water-tight bulkheads?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There certainly was, without doubt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Were the passengers supplied with lifebelts?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Were any special orders given that morning that lifebelts be put on?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Was any warning given before you were torpedoed?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None whatever. It was suddenly done and finished.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If there had been a patrol boat about, might it have been of\\r\\nassistance?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It might, but it is one of those things one never knows.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith regard to the threats against his ship, Captain Turner said he saw\\r\\nnothing except what appeared in the New York papers the day before the\\r\\nLusitania sailed. He had never heard the passengers talking about the\\r\\nthreats, he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Was a warning given to the lower decks after the ship had been struck?\"\\r\\nCaptain Turner was asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All the passengers must have heard the explosion,\" Captain Turner\\r\\nreplied.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Turner, in answer to another question, said he received no\\r\\nreport from the lookout before the torpedo struck the Lusitania.\\r\\n\\r\\nShip\\'s Bugler Livermore testified that the watertight compartments were\\r\\nclosed, but that the explosion and the force of the water must have\\r\\nburst them open. He said that all the officers were at their posts and\\r\\nthat earlier arrivals of the rescue craft would not have saved the\\r\\nsituation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter physicians had testified that the victims had met death through\\r\\nprolonged immersion and exhaustion the coroner summed up the case.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said that the first torpedo fired by the German submarine did serious\\r\\ndamage to the Lusitania, but that, not satisfied with this, the Germans\\r\\nhad discharged another torpedo. The second torpedo, he said, must have\\r\\nbeen more deadly, because it went right through the ship, hastening the\\r\\nwork of destruction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe characteristic courage of the Irish and British people was\\r\\nmanifested at the time of this terrible disaster, the coroner continued,\\r\\nand there was no panic. He charged that the responsibility \"lay on the\\r\\nGerman Government and the whole people of Germany, who collaborated in\\r\\nthe terrible crime.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I propose to ask the jury,\" he continued, \"to return the only verdict\\r\\npossible for a self-respecting jury, that the men in charge of the\\r\\nGerman submarine were guilty of wilful murder.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe jury then retired and after due deliberation prepared this verdict:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe find that the deceased met death from prolonged immersion and\\r\\nexhaustion in the sea eight miles south-southeast of Old Head of\\r\\nKinsale, Friday, May 7, 1915, owing to the sinking of the Lusitania by\\r\\ntorpedoes fired by a German submarine.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe find that the appalling crime was committed contrary to international\\r\\nlaw and the conventions of all civilized nations.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also charge the officers of said submarine and the Emperor and the\\r\\nGovernment of Germany, under whose orders they acted, with the crime of\\r\\nwholesale murder before the tribunal of the civilized world.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe desire to express sincere condolences and sympathy with the relatives\\r\\nof the deceased, the Cunard Company, and the United States, many of\\r\\nwhose citizens perished in this murderous attack on an unarmed liner.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Wilson\\'s note to Germany, written consequent on the torpedoing\\r\\nof the Lusitania, was dated six days later, showing that time for\\r\\ncareful deliberation was duly taken. The President\\'s Secretary, Joseph\\r\\nP. Tumulty, on May 8th, the day following the tragedy, made this\\r\\nstatement:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course the President feels the distress and the gravity of the\\r\\nsituation to the utmost, and is considering very earnestly but very\\r\\ncalmly, the right course of action to pursue. He knows that the people\\r\\nof the country wish and expect him to act with deliberation as well as\\r\\nwith firmness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough signed by Mr. Bryan, as Secretary of State, the note was\\r\\nwritten by the President in shorthand--a favorite method of Mr. Wilson\\r\\nin making memoranda--and transcribed by him on his own typewriter. The\\r\\ndocument was presented to the members of the President\\'s Cabinet, a\\r\\ndraft of it was sent to Counselor Lansing of the State Department, and\\r\\nafter a few minor changes, it was transmitted by cable to Ambassador\\r\\nGerard in Berlin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\\r\\nWASHINGTON, MAY 13, 1915.\\r\\nThe Secretary of State to the American Ambassador at Berlin:\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease call on the Minister of Foreign Affairs and after reading to him\\r\\nthis communication leave with him a copy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn view of recent acts of the German authorities in violation of\\r\\nAmerican rights on the high seas, which culminated in the torpedoing and\\r\\nsinking of the British steamship Lusitania on May 7, 1915, by which over\\r\\n100 American citizens lost their lives, it is clearly wise and desirable\\r\\nthat the Government of the United States and the Imperial German\\r\\nGovernment should come to a clear and full understanding as to the grave\\r\\nsituation which has resulted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sinking of the British passenger steamer Falaba by a German\\r\\nsubmarine on March 28th, through which Leon C. Thrasher, an American\\r\\ncitizen, was drowned; the attack on April 28th, on the American vessel\\r\\nCushing by a German aeroplane; the torpedoing on May 1st of the American\\r\\nvessel Gulflight by a German submarine, as a result of which two or more\\r\\nAmerican citizens met their death; and, finally, the torpedoing and\\r\\nsinking of the steamship Lusitania, constitute a series of events which\\r\\nthe Government of the United States has observed with growing concern,\\r\\ndistress, and amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecalling the humane and enlightened attitude hitherto assumed by the\\r\\nImperial German Government in matters of international right, and\\r\\nparticularly with regard to the freedom of the seas; having learned to\\r\\nrecognize the German views and the German influence in the field of\\r\\ninternational obligation as always engaged upon the side of justice and\\r\\nhumanity; and having understood the instructions of the Imperial German\\r\\nGovernment to its naval commanders to be upon the same plane of humane\\r\\naction prescribed by the naval codes of the other nations, the\\r\\nGovernment of the United States was loath to believe--it cannot now\\r\\nbring itself to believe--that these acts, so absolutely contrary to the\\r\\nrules, the practices, and the spirit of modern warfare, could have the\\r\\ncountenance, or sanction of that great government. It feels it to be its\\r\\nduty, therefore, to address the Imperial German Government concerning\\r\\nthem with the utmost frankness and in the earnest hope that it is not\\r\\nmistaken in expecting action on the part of the Imperial German\\r\\nGovernment, which will correct the unfortunate impressions which have\\r\\nbeen created, and vindicate once more the position of that government\\r\\nwith regard to the sacred freedom of the seas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Government of the United States has been apprised that the Imperial\\r\\nGerman Government considered themselves to be obliged by the\\r\\nextraordinary circumstances of the present war and the measure adopted\\r\\nby their adversaries in seeking to cut Germany off from all commerce, to\\r\\nadopt methods of retaliation which go much beyond the ordinary methods\\r\\nof warfare at sea, in the proclamation of a war zone from which they\\r\\nhave warned neutral ships to keep away. This government has already\\r\\ntaken occasion to inform the Imperial German Government that it cannot\\r\\nadmit the adoption of such measures or such a warning of danger to\\r\\noperate as in any degree an abbreviation of the rights of American\\r\\nshipmasters or of American citizens bound on lawful errands as\\r\\npassengers on merchant ships of belligerent nationality, and that it\\r\\nmust hold the Imperial German Government to a strict accountability for\\r\\nany infringement of those rights, intentional or incidental. It does not\\r\\nunderstand the Imperial German Government to question these rights. It\\r\\nassumes, on the contrary, that the Imperial Government accept, as of\\r\\ncourse, the rule that the lives of noncombatants, whether they be of\\r\\nneutral citizenship or citizens of one of the nations at war, cannot\\r\\nlawfully or rightfully be put in jeopardy by the capture or destruction\\r\\nof an unarmed merchantman, and recognize also, as all other nations do,\\r\\nthe obligation to take the usual precaution of visit and search to\\r\\nascertain whether a suspected merchantman is in fact of belligerent\\r\\nnationality or is in fact carrying contraband of war under a neutral\\r\\nflag.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph]\\r\\n  Copyright Underwood and Underwood. N. Y.\\r\\n  THE LUSITANIA\\r\\n  The sinking of this great liner by a German submarine, with the loss\\r\\n  of more than a thousand lives, caused a thrill of horror throughout\\r\\n  all neutral nations and crystallized public opinion in the United\\r\\n  States into a fierce resentment of German barbarism which indirectly\\r\\n  led to the entry into the World War.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration]\\r\\n  SUBMARINE HUNTING\\r\\n  A small naval dirigible used for scouting by the British Navy. Under\\r\\n  the cigar-shaped balloon is swung an airplane chassis equipped with\\r\\n  powerful motors and steering apparatus, together with a light gun.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Government of the United States, therefore, desires to call the\\r\\nattention of the Imperial German Government with the utmost earnestness\\r\\nto the fact that the objection to their present method of attack against\\r\\nthe trade of their enemies lies in the practical impossibility of\\r\\nemploying submarines in the destruction of commerce without disregarding\\r\\nthose rules of fairness, reason, justice, and humanity which all modern\\r\\nopinion regards as imperative. It is practically impossible for the\\r\\nofficers of a submarine to visit a merchantman at sea and examine her\\r\\npapers and cargo. It is practically impossible for them to make a prize\\r\\nof her; and, if they cannot put a prize crew on board of her, they\\r\\ncannot sink her without leaving her crew and all on board of her to the\\r\\nmercy of the sea in her small boats. These facts, it is understood, the\\r\\nImperial German Government frankly admit. We are informed that in the\\r\\ninstances of which we have spoken time enough for even that poor measure\\r\\nof safety was not given, and in at least two of the cases cited not so\\r\\nmuch as a warning was received. Manifestly, submarines cannot be used\\r\\nagainst merchantmen, as the last few weeks have shown, without an\\r\\ninevitable violation of many sacred principles of justice and humanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican citizens act within their indisputable rights in taking their\\r\\nships and in traveling wherever their legitimate business calls them\\r\\nupon the high seas, and exercise those rights in what should be the\\r\\nwell-justified confidence that their lives will not be endangered by\\r\\nacts done in clear violation of universally acknowledged international\\r\\nobligations, and certainly in the confidence that their own government\\r\\nwill sustain them in the exercise of their rights.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was recently published in the newspapers of the United States, I\\r\\nregret to inform the Imperial German Government, a formal warning,\\r\\npurporting to come from the Imperial German Embassy at Washington,\\r\\naddressed to the people of the United States, and stating, in effect,\\r\\nthat any citizen of the United States who exercised his right of free\\r\\ntravel upon the seas would do so at his peril if his journey should take\\r\\nhim within the zone of waters within which the Imperial German Navy was\\r\\nusing submarines against the commerce of Great Britain and France,\\r\\nnotwithstanding the respectful but very earnest protest of the\\r\\nGovernment of the United States. I do not refer to this for the purpose\\r\\nof calling the attention of the Imperial German Government at this time\\r\\nto the surprising irregularity of a communication from the Imperial\\r\\nGerman Embassy at Washington addressed to the people of the United\\r\\nStates through the newspapers, but only for the purpose of pointing out\\r\\nthat no warning that an unlawful and inhumane act will be committed can\\r\\npossibly be accepted as an excuse or palliation for that act or as an\\r\\nabatement of the responsibility for its commission.\\r\\n\\r\\nLong acquainted as this government has been with the character of the\\r\\nImperial Government, and with the high principles of equity by which\\r\\nthey have in the past been actuated and guided, the Government of the\\r\\nUnited States cannot believe that the commanders of the vessels which\\r\\ncommitted these acts of lawlessness did so except under a\\r\\nmisapprehension of the orders issued by the Imperial German naval\\r\\nauthorities. It takes for granted that, at least within the practical\\r\\npossibilities of every such case, the commanders even of submarines were\\r\\nexpected to do nothing that would involve the lives of noncombatants or\\r\\nthe safety of neutral ships, even at the cost of failing of their object\\r\\nof capture or destruction. It confidently expects, therefore, that the\\r\\nImperial German Government will disavow the acts of which the Government\\r\\nof the United States complains; that they will make reparation so far as\\r\\nreparation is possible for injuries which are without measure, and that\\r\\nthey will take immediate steps to prevent the recurrence of anything so\\r\\nobviously subversive of the principles of warfare for which the Imperial\\r\\nGerman Government have in the past so wisely and so firmly contended.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government and people of the United States look to the Imperial\\r\\nGerman Government for just, prompt, and enlightened action in this vital\\r\\nmatter with the greater confidence, because the United States and\\r\\nGermany are bound together not only by ties of friendship, but also by\\r\\nthe explicit stipulations of the Treaty of 1828, between the United\\r\\nStates and the Kingdom of Prussia.\\r\\n\\r\\nExpressions of regret and offers of reparation in case of the\\r\\ndestruction of neutral ships sunk by mistake, while they may satisfy\\r\\ninternational obligations, if no loss of life results, cannot justify or\\r\\nexcuse a practice the natural and necessary effect of which is to\\r\\nsubject neutral nations and neutral persons to new and immeasurable\\r\\nrisks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Imperial German Government will not expect the Government of the\\r\\nUnited States to omit any word or any act necessary to the performance\\r\\nof its sacred duty of maintaining the rights of the United States and\\r\\nits citizens and of safeguarding their free exercise and enjoyment.\\r\\nBRYAN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEx-President Roosevelt, after learning details of the sinking of the\\r\\nLusitania, made these statements:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This represents not merely piracy, but piracy on a vaster scale of\\r\\nmurder than old-time pirate ever practiced. This is the warfare which\\r\\ndestroyed Louvain and Dinant and hundreds of men, women and children in\\r\\nBelgium. It is a warfare against innocent men, women, and children\\r\\ntraveling on the ocean, and our own fellowcountrymen and countrywomen,\\r\\nwho were among the sufferers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It seems inconceivable that we can refrain from taking action in this\\r\\nmatter, for we owe it not only to humanity, but to our own national\\r\\nself-respect.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFormer President Taft made this statement:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not wish to embarrass the President of the Administration by a\\r\\ndiscussion of the subject at this stage of the information, except to\\r\\nexpress confidence that the President will follow a wise and patriotic\\r\\ncourse. We must bear in mind that if we have a war it is the people, the\\r\\nmen and women, fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, who must pay\\r\\nwith lives and money the cost of it, and therefore they should not be\\r\\nhurried into the sacrifices until it is made clear that they wish it and\\r\\nknow what they are doing when they wish it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I agree that the inhumanity of the circumstances in the case now\\r\\npresses us on, but in the heat of even just indignation is this the best\\r\\ntime to act, when action involves such momentous consequences and means\\r\\nuntold loss of life and treasure? There are things worse than war, but\\r\\ndelay, due to calm deliberation, cannot change the situation or minimize\\r\\nthe effect of what we finally conclude to do.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With the present condition of the war in Europe, our action, if it is\\r\\nto be extreme, will not lose efficiency by giving time to the people,\\r\\nwhose war it will be, to know what they are facing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A demand for war that cannot survive the passion of the first days of\\r\\npublic indignation and will not endure the test of delay and\\r\\ndeliberation by all the people is not one that should be yielded to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Wilson was criticised later by many persons for not insisting\\r\\nupon a declaration of war immediately after the sinking of the\\r\\nLusitania. Undoubtedly the advice of former President Taft and of others\\r\\nhigh in statesmanship, prevailed with the President. This in substance\\r\\nwas that America should prepare resolutely and thoroughly, giving\\r\\nGermany in the meantime no excuse for charges that America\\'s entrance\\r\\ninto the conflict was for aggression or for selfish purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was seen even as early as the sinking of the Lusitania that Germany\\'s\\r\\nonly hope for final success lay in the submarine. It was reasoned that\\r\\nunrestricted submarine warfare against the shipping of the world, so far\\r\\nas tended toward the provisioning and munitioning of the Allies, would\\r\\nbe the inevitable outcome. It was further seen that when that\\r\\ndeclaration would be made by Germany, America\\'s decision for war must be\\r\\nmade. The President and his Cabinet thereupon made all their plans\\r\\nlooking toward that eventuality.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe resignation of Mr. Bryan from the Cabinet was followed by the\\r\\nappointment of Robert Lansing as Secretary of State. It was recognized\\r\\non both sides of the Atlantic that President Wilson in all essential\\r\\nmatters affecting the war was active in the preparation of all state\\r\\npapers and in the direction of that department. Another Cabinet vacancy\\r\\nwas created when Lindley M. Garrison, of New Jersey, resigned the\\r\\nportfolio of Secretary of War because of a clash upon his militant views\\r\\nfor preparedness. Newton D. Baker, of Cleveland, Ohio, a close friend\\r\\nand supporter of President Wilson, was appointed in his stead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVII\\r\\n\\r\\nNEUVE CHAPELLE AND WAR IN BLOOD-SOAKED TRENCHES\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the immortal stand of Joffre at the first battle of the Marne and\\r\\nthe sudden savage thrust at the German center which sent von Kluck and\\r\\nhis men reeling back in retreat to the prepared defenses along the line\\r\\nof the Aisne, the war in the western theater resolved itself into a play\\r\\nfor position from deep intrenchments. Occasionally would come a sudden\\r\\nbig push by one side or the other in which artillery was massed until\\r\\nhub touched hub and infantry swept to glory and death in waves of gray,\\r\\nor blue or khaki as the case might be. But these tremendous efforts and\\r\\nconsequent slaughters did not change the long battle line from the Alps\\r\\nto the North Sea materially. Here and there a bulge would be made by the\\r\\nterrific pressure of men and material in some great assault like that\\r\\nfirst push of the British at Neuve Chapelle, like the German attack at\\r\\nVerdun or like the tremendous efforts by both sides on that bloodiest of\\r\\nall battlefields, the Somme.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeuve Chapelle deserves particular mention as the test in which the\\r\\nBritish soldiers demonstrated their might in equal contest against the\\r\\nenemy. There had been a disposition in England as elsewhere up to that\\r\\ntime to rate the Germans as supermen, to exalt the potency of the\\r\\nscientific equipment with which the German army had taken the field.\\r\\nWhen the battle of Neuve Chapelle had been fought, although its losses\\r\\nwere heavy, there was no longer any doubt in the British nation that\\r\\nvictory was only a question of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe action came as a pendant to the attack by General de Langle de\\r\\nCary\\'s French army during February, 1915, at Perthes, that had been a\\r\\nsteady relentless pressure by artillery and infantry upon a strong\\r\\nGerman position. To meet it heavy reinforcements had been shifted by the\\r\\nGermans from the trenches between La Bassee and Lille. The earthworks at\\r\\nNeuve Chapelle had been particularly depleted and only a comparatively\\r\\nsmall body of Saxons and Bavarians defended them. Opposite this body was\\r\\nthe first British army. The German intrenchments at Neuve Chapelle\\r\\nsurrounded and defended the highlands upon which were placed the German\\r\\nbatteries and in their turn defended the road towards Lille, Roubaix and\\r\\nTurcoing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe task assigned to Sir John French was to make an assault with only\\r\\nforty-eight thousand men on a comparatively narrow front. There was only\\r\\none practicable method for effective preparation, and this was chosen by\\r\\nthe British general. An artillery concentration absolutely unprecedented\\r\\nup to that time was employed by him. Field pieces firing at point-blank\\r\\nrange were used to cut the barbed wire entanglements defending the enemy\\r\\nintrenchments, while howitzers and bombing airplanes were used to drop\\r\\nhigh explosives into the defenseless earthworks.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Douglas Haig, later to become the commander-in-chief of the British\\r\\nforces, was in command of the first army. Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien\\r\\ncommanded the second army. It was the first army that bore the brunt of\\r\\nthe attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo engagement during the years on the western front was more sudden and\\r\\nsurprising in its onset than that drive of the British against Neuve\\r\\nChapelle. At seven o\\'clock on the morning of Wednesday, March 10, 1915,\\r\\nthe British artillery was lazily engaged in lobbing over a desultory\\r\\nshell fire upon the German trenches. It was the usual breakfast\\r\\nappetizer, and nobody on the German side took any unusual notice of it.\\r\\nReally, however, the shelling was scientific \"bracketing\" of the enemy\\'s\\r\\nimportant position. The gunners were making sure of their ranges.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 7.30 range finding ended, and with a roar that shook the earth the\\r\\nmost destructive and withering artillery action of the war up to that\\r\\ntime was on. Field pieces sending their shells hurtling only a few feet\\r\\nabove the earth tore the wire emplacements of the enemy to pieces and\\r\\nmade kindling wood of the supports. Howitzers sent high explosive\\r\\nshells, containing lyddite, of 15-inch, 9.2-inch and 6-inch caliber into\\r\\nthe doomed trenches and later into the ruined village. It was eight\\r\\no\\'clock in the morning, one-half hour after the beginning of the\\r\\nartillery action, that the village was bombarded. During this time\\r\\nBritish soldiers were enabled to walk about in No Man\\'s Land behind the\\r\\ncurtain of fire with absolute immunity. No German rifleman or machine\\r\\ngunner left cover. The scene on the German side of the line was like\\r\\nthat upon the blasted surface of the moon, pock-marked with shell holes,\\r\\nand with no trace of human life to be seen above ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map: Neuve Chapelle and surroundings.]\\r\\n  THE BATTLE GROUND OF NEUVE CHAPELLE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAn eye witness describing the scene said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The dawn, which broke reluctantly through a veil of clouds on the\\r\\nmorning of Wednesday, March 10, 1915, seemed as any other to the Germans\\r\\nbehind the white and blue sandbags in their long line of trenches\\r\\ncurving in a hemicycle about the battered village of Neuve Chapelle. For\\r\\nfive months they had remained undisputed masters of the positions they\\r\\nhad here wrested from the British in October. Ensconced in their\\r\\ncomfortably-arranged trenches with but a thin outpost in their fire\\r\\ntrenches, they had watched day succeed day and night succeed night\\r\\nwithout the least variation from the monotony of trench warfare, the\\r\\nintermittent bark of the machine guns--rat-tat-tat-tat-tat--and the\\r\\nperpetual rattle of rifle fire, with here and there a bomb, and now and\\r\\nthen an exploded mine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For weeks past the German airmen had grown strangely shy. On this\\r\\nWednesday morning none were aloft to spy out the strange doings which,\\r\\nas dawn broke, might have been descried on the desolate roads behind the\\r\\nBritish lines.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From ten o\\'clock of the preceding evening endless files of men marched\\r\\nsilently down the roads leading towards the German positions through\\r\\nLaventie and Richebourg St. Vaast, poor shattered villages of the dead\\r\\nwhere months of incessant bombardment have driven away the last\\r\\ninhabitants and left roofless houses and rent roadways....\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Two days before, a quiet room, where Nelson\\'s Prayer stands on the\\r\\nmantel-shelf, saw the ripening of the plans that sent these sturdy sons\\r\\nof Britain\\'s four kingdoms marching all through the night. Sir John\\r\\nFrench met the army corps commanders and unfolded to them his plans for\\r\\nthe offensive of the British army against the German line at Neuve\\r\\nChapelle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The onslaught was to be a surprise. That was its essence. The Germans\\r\\nwere to be battered with artillery, then rushed before they recovered\\r\\ntheir wits. We had thirty-six clear hours before us. Thus long, it was\\r\\nreckoned (with complete accuracy as afterwards appeared), must elapse\\r\\nbefore the Germans, whose line before us had been weakened, could rush\\r\\nup reinforcements. To ensure the enemy\\'s being pinned down right and\\r\\nleft of the \\'great push,\\' an attack was to be delivered north and south\\r\\nof the main thrust simultaneously with the assault on Neuve Chapelle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map bounded by Armentieres on the North, Lille on the\\r\\nEast, Estaires on the West and Carvin on the South.]\\r\\n  MAP OF THE BATTLE FRONT BETWEEN ARMENTIERES AND LA BASSEE\\r\\n  On the left, half way up the map, may be seen Neuve Chapelle; a little\\r\\n  to the right of it is Aubers, where some of the sternest fighting\\r\\n  occurred.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter describing the impatience of the British soldiers as they awaited\\r\\nthe signal to open the attack, and the actual beginning of the\\r\\nengagement, the narrator continues:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then hell broke loose. With a mighty, hideous, screeching burst of\\r\\nnoise, hundreds of guns spoke. The men in the front trenches were\\r\\ndeafened by the sharp reports of the field-guns spitting out their\\r\\nshells at close range to cut through the Germans\\' barbed wire\\r\\nentanglements. In some cases the trajectory of these vicious missiles\\r\\nwas so flat that they passed only a few feet above the British trenches.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The din was continuous. An officer who had the curious idea of putting\\r\\nhis ear to the ground said it was as though the earth were being smitten\\r\\ngreat blows with a Titan\\'s hammer. After the first few shells had\\r\\nplunged screaming amid clouds of earth and dust into the German\\r\\ntrenches, a dense pall of smoke hung over the German lines. The\\r\\nsickening fumes of lyddite blew back into the British trenches. In some\\r\\nplaces the troops were smothered in earth and dust or even spattered\\r\\nwith blood from the hideous fragments of human bodies that went hurtling\\r\\nthrough the air. At one point the upper half of a German officer, his\\r\\ncap crammed on his head, was blown into one of our trenches.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Words will never convey any adequate idea of the horror of those five\\r\\nand thirty minutes. When the hands of officers\\' watches pointed to five\\r\\nminutes past eight, whistles resounded along the British lines. At the\\r\\nsame moment the shells began to burst farther ahead, for, by previous\\r\\narrangement, the gunners, lengthening their fuses, were \\'lifting\\' on to\\r\\nthe village of Neuve Chapelle so as to leave the road open for our\\r\\ninfantry to rush in and finish what the guns had begun.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The shells were now falling thick among the houses of Neuve Chapelle, a\\r\\nconfused mass of buildings seen reddish through the pillars of smoke and\\r\\nflying earth and dust. At the sound of the whistle--alas for the bugle,\\r\\nonce the herald of victory, now banished from the fray!--our men\\r\\nscrambled out of the trenches and hurried higgledy-piggledy into the\\r\\nopen. Their officers were in front. Many, wearing overcoats and carrying\\r\\nrifles with fixed bayonets, closely resembled their men.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was from the center of our attacking line that the assault was\\r\\npressed home soonest. The guns had done their work well. The trenches\\r\\nwere blown to irrecognizable pits dotted with dead. The barbed wire had\\r\\nbeen cut like so much twine. Starting from the Rue Tilleloy the Lincolns\\r\\nand the Berkshires were off the mark first, with orders to swerve to\\r\\nright and left respectively as soon as they had captured the first line\\r\\nof trenches, in order to let the Royal Irish Rifles and the Rifle\\r\\nBrigade through to the village. The Germans left alive in the trenches,\\r\\nhalf demented with fright, surrounded by a welter of dead and dying men,\\r\\nmostly surrendered. The Berkshires were opposed with the utmost\\r\\ngallantry by two German officers who had remained alone in a trench\\r\\nserving a machine gun. But the lads from Berkshire made their way into\\r\\nthat trench and bayoneted the Germans where they stood, fighting to the\\r\\nlast. The Lincolns, against desperate resistance, eventually occupied\\r\\ntheir section of the trench and then waited for the Irishmen and the\\r\\nRifle Brigade to come and take the village ahead of them. Meanwhile the\\r\\nsecond Thirty-ninth Garhwalis on the right had taken their trenches with\\r\\na rush and were away towards the village and the Biez Wood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Things had moved so fast that by the time the troops were ready to\\r\\nadvance against the village the artillery had not finished its work. So,\\r\\nwhile the Lincolns and the Berks assembled the prisoners who were\\r\\ntrooping out of the trenches in all directions, the infantry on whom\\r\\ndevolved the honor of capturing the village, waited. One saw them\\r\\nstanding out in the open, laughing and cracking jokes amid the terrific\\r\\ndin made by the huge howitzer shells screeching overhead and bursting in\\r\\nthe village, the rattle of machine guns all along the line, and the\\r\\npopping of rifles. Over to the right where the Garhwalis had been\\r\\nworking with the bayonet, men were shouting hoarsely and wounded were\\r\\ngroaning as the stretcher-bearers, all heedless of bullets, moved\\r\\nswiftly to and fro over the shell-torn ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There was bloody work in the village of Neuve Chapelle. The capture of\\r\\na place at the bayonet point is generally a grim business, in which\\r\\ninstant, unconditional surrender is the only means by which bloodshed, a\\r\\ndeal of bloodshed, can be prevented. If there is individual resistance\\r\\nhere and there the attacking troops cannot discriminate. They must go\\r\\nthrough, slaying as they go such as oppose them (the Germans have a\\r\\nmonopoly of the finishing-off of wounded men), otherwise the enemy\\'s\\r\\nresistance would not be broken, and the assailants would be sniped and\\r\\nenfiladed from hastily prepared strongholds at half a dozen different\\r\\npoints.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The village was a sight that the men say they will never forget. It\\r\\nlooked as if an earthquake had struck it. The published photographs do\\r\\nnot give any idea of the indescribable mass of ruins to which our guns\\r\\nreduced it. The chaos is so utter that the very line of the streets is\\r\\nall but obliterated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was indeed a scene of desolation into which the Rifle Brigade--the\\r\\nfirst regiment to enter the village, I believe--raced headlong. Of the\\r\\nchurch only the bare shell remained, the interior lost to view beneath a\\r\\ngigantic mound of debris. The little churchyard was devastated, the very\\r\\ndead plucked from their graves, broken coffins and ancient bones\\r\\nscattered about amid the fresher dead, the slain of that morning--\\r\\ngray-green forms asprawl athwart the tombs. Of all that once fair\\r\\nvillage but two things remained intact--two great crucifixes reared\\r\\naloft, one in the churchyard, the other over against the chateau. From\\r\\nthe cross, that is the emblem of our faith, the figure of Christ, yet\\r\\nintact though all pitted with bullet marks, looked down in mute agony on\\r\\nthe slain in the village.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The din and confusion were indescribable. Through the thick pall of\\r\\nshell smoke Germans were seen on all sides, some emerging half dazed\\r\\nfrom cellars and dugouts, their hands above their heads, others dodging\\r\\nround the shattered houses, others firing from the windows, from behind\\r\\ncarts, even from behind the overturned tombstones. Machine guns were\\r\\nfiring from the houses on the outskirts, rapping out their\\r\\nnerve-racking note above the noise of the rifles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just outside the village there was a scene of tremendous enthusiasm.\\r\\nThe Rifle Brigade, smeared with dust and blood, fell in with the Third\\r\\nGurkhas with whom they had been brigaded in India. The little brown men\\r\\nwere dirty but radiant. Kukri in hand they had very thoroughly gone\\r\\nthrough some houses at the cross-roads on the Rue du Bois and silenced a\\r\\nparty of Germans who were making themselves a nuisance there with some\\r\\nmachine guns. Riflemen and Gurkhas cheered themselves hoarse.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map:  Bapaume on the North, Albert on the West, Rosieres and\\r\\nChaulnes on the South and Peronne on the East.]\\r\\n  SCENE OF THE BLOODY BATTLES OF THE SOMME\\r\\n  The tide of war swept over this terrain with terrific violence.\\r\\n  Peronne was taken by the British in their great offensives of 1916-17;\\r\\n  in the last desperate effort of the Germans in 1918 they plunged\\r\\n  through Peronne advancing 35 miles, only to be hurled back with awful\\r\\n  losses by Marshal Foch. The town of Albert was taken and retaken\\r\\n  several times.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately for the complete success of the brilliant attack a great\\r\\ndelay was caused by the failure of the artillery that was to have\\r\\ncleared the barbed wire entanglements for the Twenty-third Brigade, and\\r\\nbecause of the unlooked for destruction of the British field telephone\\r\\nsystem by shell and rifle fire. The check of the Twenty-third Brigade\\r\\nbanked other commands back of it, and the Twenty-fifth Brigade was\\r\\nobliged to fight at right angles to the line of battle. The Germans\\r\\nquickly rallied at these points, and took a terrific toll in British\\r\\nlives. Particularly was this true at three specially strong German\\r\\npositions. One called Port Arthur by the British, another at Pietre Mill\\r\\nand the third was the fortified bridge over Des Layes Creek.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of the lack of telephone communication it was impossible to send\\r\\nreinforcements to the troops that had been held up by barbed wire and\\r\\nother emplacements and upon which German machine guns were pouring a\\r\\nsteady stream of death.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Twenty-third Brigade had been held up by unbroken barbed wire\\r\\nnorthwest of Neuve Chapelle, so the Seventh Division of the Fourth Corps\\r\\nwas also checked in its action against the ridge of Aubers on the left\\r\\nof Neuve Chapelle. Under the plan of Sir Douglas Haig the Seventh\\r\\nDivision was to have waited until the Eighth Division had reached Neuve\\r\\nChapelle, when it was to charge through Aubers. With the tragic mistake\\r\\nthat cost the Twenty-third Brigade so dearly, the plan affecting the\\r\\nSeventh Division went awry. The German artillery, observing the\\r\\nconcentration of the Seventh Division opposite Aubers, opened a vigorous\\r\\nfire upon that front. During the afternoon General Haig ordered a charge\\r\\nupon the German positions. The advance was made in short rushes in the\\r\\nface of a fire that seemed to blaze from an inferno. Inch by inch the\\r\\nground was drenched with British blood. At 5.30 in the afternoon the men\\r\\ndug themselves in under the relentless German fire. Further advance\\r\\nbecame impossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe night was one of horror. Every minute the men were under heavy\\r\\nbombardment. At dawn on March 11th the dauntless British infantry rushed\\r\\nfrom the trenches in an effort to carry Aubers, but the enemy artillery\\r\\nnow greatly reinforced made that task an impossible one. The trenches\\r\\noccupied by the British forces were consolidated and the salient made by\\r\\nthe push was held by the British with bulldog tenacity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of men employed in the action on the British side was\\r\\nforty-eight thousand. During the early surprise of the action the loss\\r\\nwas slight. Had the wire in front of the Twenty-third Brigade been cut\\r\\nby the artillery assigned to such action, and had the telephone system\\r\\nnot been destroyed the success of the thrust would have been complete.\\r\\nThe delay of four and a half hours between the first and second phases\\r\\nof the attack caused virtually all the losses sustained by the attacking\\r\\nforce. The total casualties were 12,811 men of the British forces. Of\\r\\nthese 1,751 officers and privates were taken prisoners and 10,000\\r\\nofficers and men were killed and wounded.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe action continued throughout Thursday, March 11th, with little change\\r\\nin the general situation. The British still held Neuve Chapelle and\\r\\ntheir intrenchments threatened Aubers. On Friday morning, March 12th,\\r\\nthe Crown Prince of Bavaria made a desperate attempt under cover of a\\r\\nheavy fog to recapture the village. The effort was made in\\r\\ncharacteristic German dense formations. The Westphalian and Bavarian\\r\\ntroops came out of Biez Wood in waves of gray-green, only to be blown to\\r\\npieces by British guns already loaded and laid on the mark. Elsewhere\\r\\nthe British waited until the Germans were scarcely more than fifty paces\\r\\naway when they opened with deadly rapid fire before which the German\\r\\nwaves melted like snow before steam. It was such slaughter as the\\r\\nBritish had experienced when held up before Aubers. Slaughter that\\r\\nstaggered Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo ended Neuve Chapelle, a battle in which the decision rested with the\\r\\nBritish, a victory for which a fearful price had been paid but out of\\r\\nwhich came a confidence that was to hearten the British nation and to\\r\\nput sinews of steel into the British army for the dread days to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story of Neuve Chapelle was repeated in large and in miniature many\\r\\ntimes during the deadlock of trench warfare on the western front until\\r\\nvictory finally came to the Allies. During those years the western\\r\\nbattle front lay like a wounded snake across France and Belgium. It\\r\\nwrithed and twisted, now this way, now that, as one side or the other\\r\\ngambled with men and shells and airplanes for some brief advantage. It\\r\\nbent back in a great bulge when von Hindenburg made his famous retreat\\r\\nin the winter of 1916 after the Allies had pressed heavily against the\\r\\nTeutonic front upon the ghastly field of the Somme. The record is one of\\r\\ngreat value to military strategists, to the layman it is only a\\r\\nsuccession of artillery barrages, of gas attacks, of aerial\\r\\nreconnaissances and combats.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day grew to be very much like another in that deadlock of pythons. A\\r\\nplay for position here was met by a counter-thrust in another place.\\r\\nGerman inventions were out-matched and outnumbered by those coming from\\r\\nthe Allied side.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrench warfare became the daily life of the men. They learned to fight\\r\\nand live in the open. The power of human adaptation to abnormal\\r\\nconditions was never better exemplified than in those weary, dreary\\r\\nyears on the western front.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fighting-lines consisted generally of one, two, or three lines of\\r\\nshelter-trenches lying parallel, measuring twenty or twenty-five inches\\r\\nin width, and varying in length according to the number they hold; the\\r\\ntrenches were joined together by zigzag approaches and by a line of\\r\\nreinforced trenches (armed with machine guns), which were almost\\r\\ncompletely proof against rifle, machine gun, or gun fire. The ordinary\\r\\nGerman trenches were almost invisible from 350 yards away, a distance\\r\\nwhich permitted a very deadly fire. It is easy to realize that if the\\r\\nenemy occupied three successive lines and a line of reinforced\\r\\nintrenchments, the attacking line was likely, at the lowest estimate, to\\r\\nbe decimated during an advance of 350 yards--by rifle fire at a range of\\r\\n350 yards\\' distance, and by the extremely quick fire of the machine\\r\\nguns, each of which delivered from 300 to 600 bullets a minute with\\r\\nabsolute precision. In the field-trench, a soldier enjoyed far greater\\r\\nsecurity than he would if merely prone behind his knapsack in an\\r\\nexcavation barely fifteen inches deep. He had merely to stoop down a\\r\\nlittle to disappear below the level of the ground and be immune from\\r\\ninfantry fire; moreover, his machine guns fired without endangering him.\\r\\nIn addition, this stooping position brought the man\\'s knapsack on a\\r\\nlevel with his helmet, thus forming some protection against shrapnel and\\r\\nshell-splinters.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the back of the German trenches shelters were dug for\\r\\nnon-commissioned officers and for the commander of the unit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Painting: Several planes flying over troops in a\\r\\ndemolished town.]\\r\\n  THE STRUGGLE FOR ARMENTIERES\\r\\n  Allied forces holding up a German attack on the Lys Canal.

Officers,\\r\\nnon-commissioned officers, and men of the engineers were straightway\\r\\ndetached in every unit to teach the infantry how to construct similar\\r\\nshelters. The education was quick, and very soon they had completed the\\r\\nwork necessary for the protection of all. The tools of the enemy\\r\\n\"casualties,\" the spades and picks left behind in deserted villages,\\r\\nwere all gladly piled on to the French soldiers\\' knapsacks, to be\\r\\ncarried willingly by the very men who used to grumble at being loaded\\r\\nwith even the smallest regulation tool. As soon as night had set in on\\r\\nthe occasion of a lull in the fighting, the digging of the trenches was\\r\\nbegun. Sometimes, in the darkness, the men of each fighting nation--less\\r\\nthan 500 yards away from their enemy--would hear the noise of the\\r\\nworkers of the foe: the sounds of picks and axes; the officers\\' words of\\r\\nencouragement; and tacitly they would agree to an armistice during which\\r\\nto dig shelters from which, in the morning, they would dash out, to\\r\\nfight once more.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommodious, indeed, were some of the trench barracks. One French soldier\\r\\nwrote:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In really up-to-date intrenchments you may find kitchens, dining-rooms,\\r\\nbedrooms, and even stables. One regiment has first class cow-sheds. One\\r\\nday a whimsical \\'piou-piou,\\' finding a cow wandering about in the\\r\\ndanger zone, had the bright idea of finding shelter for it in the\\r\\ntrenches. The example was quickly followed, and at this moment the\\r\\n----th Infantry possess an underground farm, in which fat kine, well\\r\\ncared for, give such quantities of milk that regular distributions of\\r\\nbutter are being made--and very good butter, too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this is not all. An officer writes home a tale of yet another one of\\r\\nthe comforts of home added to the equipment of the trenches:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are clean people here. Thanks to the ingenuity of ----, we are able\\r\\nto take a warm bath every day from ten to twelve. We call this teasing\\r\\nthe \\'bosches,\\' for this bathing-establishment of the latest type is\\r\\nfitted up--would you believe it?--in the trenches!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\r\\n\\r\\nSTEADFAST SOUTH AFRICA\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Germany struck at the heart of France through Belgium simultaneous\\r\\naction was undertaken by the German Command in Southwest Africa through\\r\\npropaganda and mobilization of the available German troops. Insidiously\\r\\nand by the use of money systematic propaganda was instituted to corrupt\\r\\nthe Boers against their allegiance to the Union of South Africa. One\\r\\ngreat character stood like a rock against all their efforts. It was the\\r\\ncharacter of General Louis Botha, formerly arrayed in battle against the\\r\\nBritish during the Boer uprising.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith characteristic determination he formulated plans for the invasion\\r\\nof German Southwest Africa without asking permission of the citizens of\\r\\nthe South African Union or of the British Foreign Office. His vision\\r\\ncomprehended an invasion that would have as its culmination a\\r\\nBritish-Boer colony where the German colony had been, and that from\\r\\nCable Bay to the source of the Nile there would be one mighty union,\\r\\nwith a great trunk railway feeding Egypt, the Soudan, Rhodesia, Uganda,\\r\\nand the Union of South Africa. An able lieutenant to Botha was General\\r\\nSmuts. He co-operated with his chief in a campaign of education. They\\r\\npointed out the absolute necessity for deafness to the German tempters,\\r\\nand succeeded in obtaining full co-operation for the Botha plan of\\r\\ninvasion from the British Imperial Government and the South African\\r\\nUnion. Concerning this agreement General Botha said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To forget their loyalty to the empire in this hour of trial would be\\r\\nscandalous and shameful, and would blacken South Africa in the eyes of\\r\\nthe whole world. Of this South Africans were incapable. They had endured\\r\\nsome of the greatest sacrifices that could be demanded of a people, but\\r\\nthey had always kept before them ideals, founded on Christianity, and\\r\\nnever in their darkest days had they sought to gain their ends by\\r\\ntreasonable means. The path of treason was an unknown path to Dutch and\\r\\nEnglish alike.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Their duty and their conscience alike bade them be faithful and true to\\r\\nthe Imperial Government in all respects in this hour of darkness and\\r\\ntrouble. That was the attitude of the Union Government; that was the\\r\\nattitude of the people of South Africa. The government had cabled to the\\r\\nImperial Government at the outbreak of war, offering to undertake the\\r\\ndefense of South Africa, thereby releasing the Imperial troops for\\r\\nservice elsewhere. This was accepted, and the Union Defense Force was\\r\\nmobilized.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPreliminary to the invasion of German Southwest Africa, General Botha\\r\\nproclaimed martial law throughout the Union. The first act in\\r\\nconsequence of this proclamation was the arrest of a number of\\r\\nconspirators who were planning sedition throughout the Union. The head\\r\\nof this conspiracy was Lieutenant-Colonel S. G. Maritz. General Beyers\\r\\nand General De Wet, both Boer officers of high standing, co-operated\\r\\nwith Maritz in an abortive rebellion. The situation was most trying for\\r\\nthe native Boers and, to their credit be it recorded, the great majority\\r\\nof them stood out strongly against the Germans. Vigorous action by Botha\\r\\nand Smuts smashed the rebellion in the fall of 1914. A force acting\\r\\nunder General Botha in person attacked the troops under General Beyers\\r\\nat Rustemburg on October 27th, and on the next day General Beyers sought\\r\\nrefuge in flight. A smaller force acting under General Kemp was also\\r\\nrouted on November 5th.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral De Wet opened his campaign of rebellion on November 7th in an\\r\\naction at Wimburg, where he defeated a smaller force of Loyalists under\\r\\nGeneral Cronje. The decisive battle at Marquard occurred on November\\r\\n12th, Botha commanding the Loyalists forces in person and De Wet the\\r\\nrebels. The victory of Botha in this fierce engagement was complete. De\\r\\nWet was routed and was captured on December 1st with a rear-guard of\\r\\nfifty-two men. General Beyers was drowned on December 9th while\\r\\nattempting to escape from the Vall into the Transvaal. This virtually\\r\\nended all opposition to General Botha. The invasion of German Southwest\\r\\nAfrica began on January 5, 1915, and was one uninterrupted chapter of\\r\\nsuccesses. Through jungle and swamp, swept by torrential rains and\\r\\nencountering obstacles that would have disheartened any but the stoutest\\r\\nheart, the little force of invasion swept forward. Most of the\\r\\nengagements by the enemy were in the nature of guerrilla and rear-guard\\r\\nactions. The backbone of the German command was broken and the remaining\\r\\nforces capitulated in July, 1915.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the capitulation came the story of the German mismanagement in\\r\\nSouthwest Africa, and particularly their horrible treatment of the\\r\\nHereros and Hottentots in the country misgoverned by them. An official\\r\\nreport fully authenticated was made and none of its essential details\\r\\nwere refuted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe report told the story of how the German authorities exterminated the\\r\\nnative Hereros. When Germany annexed the country in 1890 they were\\r\\nbelieved to possess well over 150,000 head of cattle. After the\\r\\nrinderpest scourge of 1897 they still owned something like 90,000 head.\\r\\nBy 1902, less than ten years after the arrival of the first German\\r\\nsettlers, the Hereros had only 45,898 head of cattle, while the 1,051\\r\\nGerman traders and farmers then in the country owned 44,487. The policy\\r\\nof robbing and killing the natives had by that time received the\\r\\nsanction of Berlin. By the end of 1905 the surviving Hereros had been\\r\\nreduced to pauperism and possessed nothing at all. In 1907 the Imperial\\r\\nGerman Government by ordinance prohibited the natives of Southwest\\r\\nAfrica from possessing live stock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wholesale theft of the natives\\' cattle, their only wealth, with the\\r\\ndirect connivance and approval of the Berlin Government, was one of the\\r\\nprimary causes of the Herero rebellion of 1904. The revolt was\\r\\nsuppressed with characteristic German ruthlessness. But the Germans were\\r\\nnot content with a mere suppression of the rising; they had decided upon\\r\\nthe practical extinction of the whole tribe. For this purpose Leutwein,\\r\\nwho was apparently regarded as too lenient, was superseded by von\\r\\nTrotha, noted for his merciless severity. He had played a notorious part\\r\\nin the Chinese Boxer rebellion, and had just suppressed the Arab rising\\r\\nin German East Africa by the wholesale massacre of men, women, and\\r\\nchildren. As a preliminary von Trotha invited the Herero chiefs to come\\r\\nin and make peace, \"as the war was now over,\" and promptly shot them in\\r\\ncold blood. Then he issued his notorious \"extermination order,\" in terms\\r\\nof which no Herero--man, woman, child, or babe--was to receive mercy or\\r\\nquarter. \"Kill every one of them,\" he said, \"and take no prisoners.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hanging of natives was a common occurrence. A German officer had the\\r\\nright to order a native to be hanged. No trial or court was necessary.\\r\\nMany were hanged merely on suspicion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hereros were far more humane in the field than the Germans. They\\r\\nwere once a fine race. Now there is only a miserable remnant left.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is amply proved by official German statistics. Out of between\\r\\n80,000 and 90,000 souls, only about 15,000 starving and fugitive Hereros\\r\\nwere alive at the end of 1905, when von Trotha relinquished his task. In\\r\\n1911, after all rebellions had been suppressed and tranquillity\\r\\nrestored, the government had a census taken. The figures, reproduced\\r\\nbelow, speak for themselves:\\r\\n\\r\\n                Estimate   Official Census\\r\\n                  1904         1911\\r\\n                                            Decrease\\r\\n  Hereros        80,000      15,130          64,870\\r\\n  Hottentots     20,000       9,781          10,219\\r\\n  Berg-Damaras   30,000      12,831          17,169\\r\\n                -------      ------          ------\\r\\n                130,000      37,742          92,258\\r\\n\\r\\nIn other words, eighty per cent of the Herero people disappeared, and\\r\\nmore than half of the Hottentot and Berg-Damara races shared the same\\r\\nfate. Dr. Paul Rohrbach\\'s dictum, \"It is applicable to a nation in the\\r\\nsame way as to the individual that the right of existence is primarily\\r\\njustified in the degree that such existence is useful for progress and\\r\\ngeneral development,\" comes forcible to mind. These natives of Southwest\\r\\nAfrica had been, weighed in the German balance and had been found\\r\\nwanting.\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany lost more than a million square miles of territory in Africa as\\r\\na direct consequence of General Botha\\'s bold action. These are divided\\r\\nin four great regions, Southwest Africa, Kamerun, Togo and East Africa.\\r\\nTogoland as this region is popularly known extends from the north shore\\r\\nof the Gulf of Guinea into the interior and is bounded by French and\\r\\nBritish colonies. By a joint attack of French and British forces,\\r\\nbeginning the second week in August, 1914, the German power in this rich\\r\\ndomain was completely broken, and the conquest of Togoland was complete\\r\\non August 26, 1914. The military operation was of a desultory nature,\\r\\nand the losses negligible in view of the area of 33,000 square miles of\\r\\nhighly productive land passed from German control.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fighting in the great region of Kamerun was somewhat more stubborn\\r\\nthan that in Togoland. The villages of Bonaberi and Duala were\\r\\nparticularly well defended. The British and French fought through swamps\\r\\nand jungle under the handicap of terrific heat, and always with victory\\r\\nat the end of the engagement. The conquest of the Kamerun was complete\\r\\nby the end of June, 1915. In addition to the operations by the British\\r\\nand French a combined Belgian and French force captured Molundu and\\r\\nNgaundera in the German Congo.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe raids by General Botha on German Southwest Africa, commenced on\\r\\nSeptember 27, 1914. A series of brilliant strategic actions resulted in\\r\\nthe conquest of a region once and a half the size of the German Empire\\r\\nat the time the Great War began. A British description of the operation\\r\\nstates:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe occupation of Windhoek was effected by General Botha\\'s North\\r\\nDamaraland forces working along the railway from Swakopmund. At the\\r\\nformer place General Vanderventer joined up with General Botha\\'s forces.\\r\\nThe force from Swakopmund met with considerable opposition, first at\\r\\nTretskopje, a small township in the great Namib Desert fifty miles to\\r\\nthe northeast of Swakopmund, and secondly at Otjimbingwe, on the Swakop\\r\\nRiver, sixty miles northwest of Windhoek. Apart from these two\\r\\ndetermined stands, however, little other opposition was encountered, and\\r\\nKaribib was occupied on May 5th and Okahandja and Windhoek on May 12th.\\r\\nWith the fall of the latter place, 3,000 Europeans and 12,000 natives\\r\\nbecame prisoners.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wireless station--one of Germany\\'s most valuable high-power\\r\\nstations, which was able to communicate with one relay only, with\\r\\nBerlin--was captured almost intact, and much rolling stock also fell\\r\\ninto the hands of the Union forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe advance from the south along the Luderitzbucht-Seeheim-Keetmanshoop\\r\\nRailway, approximately 500 miles in length, was made by two forces which\\r\\njoined hands at Keetmanshoop. The advance from Aus (captured on April\\r\\n10th) was made by General Smuts\\'s forces. Colonel (afterward General)\\r\\nVanderventer, moving up from the direction of Warmbad and Kalkfontein,\\r\\naround the flanks of Karas Mountain, pushed on after reaching\\r\\nKeetmanshoop in the direction of Gibeon. Bethany had previously been\\r\\noccupied during the advance to Seeheim. At Kabus, twenty miles to the\\r\\nnorth of Keetmanshoop, and at Gibeon pitched battles were fought between\\r\\nGeneral Vanderventer\\'s forces and the enemy. No other opposition of\\r\\nimportance was encountered, and the operations were brought to a\\r\\nsuccessful conclusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stiffest fighting in all Africa came in German East Africa. It began\\r\\nin late September, 1914, and continued until mid-June, 1915. The\\r\\nGermans, curiously enough, commenced the offensive here with an attack\\r\\nupon Monbasa, the terminus of the Uganda railway and the capital of\\r\\nBritish East Africa. The attack was planned as a joint naval and\\r\\nmilitary operation, the German cruiser Koenigsburg being assigned to\\r\\nmove into the harbor and bombard the town simultaneously with the\\r\\nassault by land. The plan went awry when the presence of British\\r\\nwarships frightened off the Koenigsburg. The land attack was easily\\r\\nchecked by a detachment of the King\\'s African Rifles and native Arabian\\r\\ntroops until the detachments of Indian Regulars arrived upon the scene.\\r\\nThe enemy thereupon retreated to his original plans.\\r\\n\\r\\nBritish reprisals came early in November, when the towns of Tanga and\\r\\nGassin were attacked by British troops. The troops selected for this\\r\\nadventure numbered 6,000 and carried only food, water, guns and\\r\\nmunitions. No protection of any kind nor any other equipment was taken\\r\\nby the soldiers. Reinforcements to the German forces delayed the capture\\r\\nof Gassin until January. A garrison of three hundred men was left there\\r\\nand this in turn was besieged by three thousand Germans. After a\\r\\nstubborn defense the Germans recaptured the town. A union of two British\\r\\nforces was accomplished early in June, 1915. One of these cut through\\r\\nGerman East Africa along the Kagera River and the other advanced on\\r\\nsteamers from Kisumu. They met the enemy on June 22d and defeated it\\r\\nwith heavy casualties. Later General Tighe, commanding the combined\\r\\nBritish forces, was congratulated on the completeness of his victory on\\r\\nJune 28th, by General Kitchener.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe territory acquired by the British as a consequence of the invasion\\r\\nof Germany\\'s African possessions, possesses formidable natural barriers,\\r\\nbut once these are past the traveller finds lands of wonderful fertility\\r\\nand great natural resources. Approaching German Southwest Africa from\\r\\nthe east access is across the Kalahari Desert. This in its trackless\\r\\ndesolation, its frequent sandstorms and torrid heat through which only\\r\\nthe hardiest and best provisioned caravans may penetrate is worse than\\r\\nthe worst that Sahara can show. There is not a sign of life. Approached\\r\\nfrom the sea the principal port is Walfish Bay, a fair harbor that was\\r\\nimproved by the British when they occupied it. Near Walfish some of the\\r\\nlargest diamonds in the history of the world have been found and gold\\r\\nfields of considerable richness have been worked. The climate of German\\r\\nSouthwest Africa, after the torrential storms of the seacoast and the\\r\\nterrific heat of the desert have been passed, is one of the most\\r\\nsalubrious in the world. It is unique among African regions in the\\r\\nopportunities it affords for colonization by white men. Great Britain\\r\\npossessed large holdings of this land before Germany came into\\r\\npossession, but abandoned them under the belief that the region was\\r\\ncomparatively worthless. There was no misapprehension on this score when\\r\\nall of the lands came into the possession of England as the result of\\r\\nthe war.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIX\\r\\n\\r\\nITALY DECLARES WAR ON AUSTRIA\\r\\n\\r\\nFor many years before the great war began the great powers of Europe\\r\\nwere divided into two great alliances, the Triple Entente, composed of\\r\\nRussia, France and England, and the Triple Alliance, composed of\\r\\nGermany, Austria and Italy. When the war began Italy refused to join\\r\\nwith Germany and Austria. Why? The answer to this question throws a\\r\\nvivid light on the origin of the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nItaly was a member of the Triple Alliance; she knew the facts, not only\\r\\nwhat was given to the public, but the inside facts. According to the\\r\\nterms of the alliance each member was bound to stand by each other only\\r\\nin case of attack. Italy refused to join with Austria and Germany\\r\\nbecause they were the aggressors. The constant assertions of the German\\r\\nstatesmen, and of the Kaiser himself, that war had been forced upon them\\r\\nwere declared untrue by their associate Italy in the very beginning, and\\r\\nthe verdict of Italy was the verdict of the world. Not much was said in\\r\\nthe beginning about Italy\\'s abstention from war. The Germans, indeed,\\r\\nsneered a little and hinted that some day Italy would be made to regret\\r\\nher course, but now that the Teuton snake is scotched the importance of\\r\\nItaly\\'s action has been perceived and appraised at its true value.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Germans from the very beginning understood the real danger that\\r\\nmight come to the Central Powers through Italian action. Every effort\\r\\nwas made by the foreign office to keep her neutral. First threats were\\r\\nused, later promises were held out of addition to Italian territory if\\r\\nshe would send her troops to Germany\\'s assistance. When this failed the\\r\\nmost strenuous efforts were made to keep Italy neutral, and a former\\r\\nGerman premier, Prince von Bulow, was sent to Italy for this purpose.\\r\\nSocialist leaders, too, were sent from Germany to urge the Italian\\r\\nSocialists to insist upon neutrality.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July, 1914, the Italian Government was not taken by surprise. They\\r\\nhad observed the increase year by year of the German army and of the\\r\\nGerman fleet. At the end of the Balkan wars they had been asked whether\\r\\nthey would agree to an Austrian attack upon Serbia. They had\\r\\nconsequently long been deliberating as to what their course should be in\\r\\ncase of war, and they had made up their minds that under no\\r\\ncircumstances would they aid Germany against England.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuite independently of her long-standing friendship with England it\\r\\nwould be suicide to Italy in her geographical position to enter a war\\r\\nwhich should permit her coast to be attacked by the English and French\\r\\nnavies, and her participation in the Triple Alliance always carried the\\r\\nproviso that it did not bind her to fight England. This was well known\\r\\nin the German foreign office, and, indeed, in France where the writers\\r\\nupon war were reckoning confidently on the withdrawing of Italy from the\\r\\nTriple Alliance, and planning to use the entire forces of France against\\r\\nGermany.\\r\\n\\r\\nA better understanding of the Italian position will result from a\\r\\nconsideration of the origin of the Triple Alliance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the war of 1870, Bismarck, perceiving the quick recovery of\\r\\nFrance, considered the advisability of attacking her again, and, to use\\r\\nhis own words, \"bleeding her white.\" He found, however, that if this\\r\\nwere attempted France would be joined by Russia and England and he gave\\r\\nup this plan. In order, however, to render France powerless he planned\\r\\nan alliance which should be able to control Europe. A league between\\r\\nGermany, Austria and Russia was his desire, and for some time every\\r\\nopportunity was taken to develop friendship with the Czar. Russia,\\r\\nhowever, remained cool. Her Pan-Slavonic sympathies were opposed to the\\r\\ninterests of Germany. Bismarck, therefore, determined, without losing\\r\\nthe friendship of Russia, to persuade Italy to join in the continental\\r\\ncombination. Italy, at the time, was the least formidable of the six\\r\\ngreat powers, but Bismarck foresaw that she could be made good use of in\\r\\nsuch a combination.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that time Italy, just after the completion of Italian unity, found\\r\\nherself in great perplexity. Her treatment of the Pope had brought about\\r\\nthe hostility of Roman Catholics throughout the world. She feared both\\r\\nFrance and Austria, who were strong Catholic countries, and hardly knew\\r\\nwhere to look for friends. The great Italian leader at the time was\\r\\nFrancesco Crispi, who, beginning as a Radical and a conspirator, had\\r\\nbecome a constitutional statesman. Bismarck professed the greatest\\r\\nfriendship for Crispi, and gave Crispi to understand that he approved of\\r\\nItaly\\'s aspirations on the Adriatic and in Tunis.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next year, however, at the Berlin Congress, Italy\\'s interests were\\r\\nignored, and finally, in 1882, France seized Tunis, to the great\\r\\nindignation of the Italians. It has been shown in more recent times that\\r\\nthe French seizure of Tunis was directly due to Bismarck\\'s instigation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Italians having been roused to wrath, Bismarck proceeded to offer\\r\\nthem a place in the councils of the Triple Alliance. It was an easy\\r\\nargument that such an alliance would protect them against France, and no\\r\\ndoubt it was promised that it would free them from the danger of attack\\r\\nby Austria. England, at the time, was isolated, and Italy continued on\\r\\nthe best understanding with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe immediate result of the alliance was a growth of Italian hostility\\r\\ntoward France, which led, in 1889, to a tariff war on France. Meanwhile\\r\\nGerman commercial and financial enterprises were pushed throughout the\\r\\nItalian peninsula. What did Italy gain by this? Her commerce was\\r\\nweakened, and Austria permitted herself every possible unfriendly act\\r\\nexcept open war.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs time went on Germany and Austria became more and more arrogant.\\r\\nItaly\\'s ambitions on the Balkan peninsula were absolutely ignored. In\\r\\n1908 Austria appropriated Bosnia and Herzegovina, another blow to Italy.\\r\\nBy this time Italy understood the situation well, and that same year,\\r\\nseeing no future for herself in Europe, she swooped down on Tripoli. In\\r\\ndoing this she forestalled Germany herself, for Germany had determined\\r\\nto seize Tripoli.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Germany and Austria were opposed to this action of Italy, but\\r\\nItaly\\'s eyes were now open. Thirty years of political alliance had\\r\\ncreated no sympathy among the Italians for the Germans. Moreover, it was\\r\\nnot entirely a question of policy. The lordly arrogance of the Prussians\\r\\ncaused sharp antagonism. The Italians were lovers of liberty; the\\r\\nGermans pledged toward autocracy. They found greater sympathy in England\\r\\nand in France.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am a son of liberty,\" said Cavour, \"to her I owe all that I am.\"\\r\\nThat, too, is Italy\\'s motto. When the war broke out popular sympathy in\\r\\nItaly was therefore strongly in favor of the Allies. The party in power,\\r\\nthe Liberals, adopted the policy of neutrality for the time being, but\\r\\nthousands of Italians volunteered for the French and British service,\\r\\nand the anti-German feeling grew greater as time went on.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, on the 23rd of May, 1915, the Italian Government withdrew its\\r\\nambassador to Austria and declared war. A complete statement of the\\r\\nnegotiations between Italy and Austria-Hungary, which led to this\\r\\ndeclaration, was delivered to the Government of the United States by the\\r\\nItalian Ambassador on May 25th. This statement, of which the following\\r\\nis an extract, lucidly presented the Italian position:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Triple Alliance was essentially defensive, and designed solely to\\r\\npreserve the status quo, or in other words equilibrium, in Europe. That\\r\\nthese were its only objects and purposes is established by the letter\\r\\nand spirit of the treaty, as well as by the intentions clearly described\\r\\nand set forth in official acts of the ministers who created the alliance\\r\\nand confirmed and renewed it in the interests of peace, which always has\\r\\ninspired Italian policy. The treaty, as long as its intents and purposes\\r\\nhad been loyally interpreted and regarded, and as long as it had not\\r\\nbeen used as a pretext for aggression against others, greatly\\r\\ncontributed to the elimination and settlement of causes of conflict, and\\r\\nfor many years assured to Europe the inestimable benefits of peace. But\\r\\nAustria-Hungary severed the treaty by her own hands. She rejected the\\r\\nresponse of Serbia which gave to her all the satisfaction she could\\r\\nlegitimately claim. She refused to listen to the conciliatory proposals\\r\\npresented by Italy in conjunction with other powers in the effort to\\r\\nspare Europe from a vast conflict, certain to drench the Continent with\\r\\nblood and to reduce it to ruin beyond the conception of human\\r\\nimagination, and finally she provoked that conflict.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Article first of the treaty embodied the usual and necessary obligation\\r\\nof such pacts--the pledge to exchange views upon any fact and economic\\r\\nquestions of a general nature that might arise pursuant to its terms.\\r\\nNone of the contracting parties had the right to undertake without a\\r\\nprevious agreement any step the consequence of which might impose a duty\\r\\nupon the other signatories arising under the alliance, or which would in\\r\\nany way whatsoever encroach upon their vital interests. This article was\\r\\nviolated by Austria-Hungary, when she sent to Serbia her note dated July\\r\\n23, 1914, an action taken without the previous assent of Italy. Thus,\\r\\nAustria-Hungary violated beyond doubt one of the fundamental provisions\\r\\nof the treaty. The obligation of Austria-Hungary to come to a previous\\r\\nunderstanding with Italy was the greater because her obstinate policy\\r\\nagainst Serbia gave rise to a situation which directly tended toward the\\r\\nprovocation of a European war.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As far back as the beginning of July, 1914, the Italian Government,\\r\\npreoccupied by the prevailing feeling in Vienna, caused to be laid\\r\\nbefore the Austro-Hungarian Government a number of suggestions advising\\r\\nmoderation, and warning it of the impending danger of a European\\r\\noutbreak. The course adopted by Austria-Hungary against Serbia\\r\\nconstituted, moreover, a direct encroachment upon the general interests\\r\\nof Italy both political and economical in the Balkan peninsula.\\r\\nAustria-Hungary could not for a moment imagine that Italy could remain\\r\\nindifferent while Serbian independence was being trodden upon. On a\\r\\nnumber of occasions theretofore, Italy gave Austria to understand, in\\r\\nfriendly but clear terms, that the independence of Serbia was considered\\r\\nby Italy as essential to the Balkan equilibrium. Austria-Hungary was\\r\\nfurther advised that Italy could never permit that equilibrium to be\\r\\ndisturbed through a prejudice. This warning had been conveyed not only\\r\\nby her diplomats in private conversations with responsible\\r\\nAustro-Hungarian officials, but was proclaimed publicly by Italian\\r\\nstatesmen on the floors of Parliament.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Therefore, when Austria-Hungary ignored the usual practices and menaced\\r\\nSerbia by sending her an ultimatum, without in any way notifying the\\r\\nItalian Government of what she proposed to do, indeed leaving that\\r\\ngovernment to learn of her action through the press, rather than through\\r\\nthe usual channels of diplomacy, when Austria-Hungary took this\\r\\nunprecedented course she not only severed her alliance with Italy but\\r\\ncommitted an act inimical to Italy\\'s interests....\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After the European war broke out Italy sought to come to an\\r\\nunderstanding with Austria-Hungary with a view to a settlement\\r\\nsatisfactory to both parties which might avert existing and future\\r\\ntrouble. Her efforts were in vain, notwithstanding the efforts of\\r\\nGermany, which for months endeavored to induce Austria-Hungary to comply\\r\\nwith Italy\\'s suggestion thereby recognizing the propriety and legitimacy\\r\\nof the Italian attitude. Therefore Italy found herself compelled by the\\r\\nforce of events to seek other solutions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Inasmuch as the treaty of alliance with Austria-Hungary had ceased\\r\\nvirtually to exist and served only to prolong a state of continual\\r\\nfriction and mutual suspicion, the Italian Ambassador at Vienna was\\r\\ninstructed to declare to the Austro-Hungarian Government that the\\r\\nItalian Government considered itself free from the ties arising out of\\r\\nthe treaty of the Triple Alliance in so far as Austria-Hungary was\\r\\nconcerned. This communication was delivered in Vienna on May 4th.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Subsequently to this declaration, and after we had been obliged to take\\r\\nsteps for the protection of our interests, the Austro-Hungarian\\r\\nGovernment submitted new concessions, which, however, were deemed\\r\\ninsufficient and by no means met our minimum demands. These offers could\\r\\nnot be considered under the circumstances. The Italian Government taking\\r\\ninto consideration what has been stated above, and supported by the vote\\r\\nof Parliament and the solemn manifestation of the country came to the\\r\\ndecision that any further delay would be inadvisable. Therefore, on May\\r\\n23d, it was declared, in the name of the King, to the Austro-Hungarian\\r\\nAmbassador at Rome, that, beginning the following day, May 24th, it\\r\\nwould consider itself in a state of war with Austria-Hungary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a closely reasoned argument that the Italian statesmen presented,\\r\\nbut there was something more than reasoned argument in Italy\\'s course.\\r\\nShe had been waiting for years for the opportunity to bring under her\\r\\nflag the men of her own race still held in subjection by hated Austria.\\r\\nNow was the time or never. Her people had become roused. Mobs filled the\\r\\nstreets. Great orators, even the great poet, D\\'Annunzio, proclaimed a\\r\\nholy war. The sinking of the Lusitania poured oil on the flames, and the\\r\\ntreatment of Belgium and eastern France added to the fury.\\r\\n\\r\\nItalian statesmen, even if they had so desired, could not have withstood\\r\\nthe pressure. It was a crusade for Italia Irredenta, for civilization,\\r\\nfor humanity. The country had been flooded by representatives of German\\r\\npropaganda, papers had been hired and, by all report, money in large\\r\\namounts distributed. But every German effort was swept away in the flood\\r\\nof feeling. It was the people\\'s war.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmid tremendous enthusiasm the Chamber of Deputies adopted by vote of\\r\\n407 to 74 the bill conferring upon the government full power to make\\r\\nwar. All members of the Cabinet maintained absolute silence regarding\\r\\nwhat step should follow the action of the chamber. When the chamber\\r\\nreassembled on May 20th, after its long recess, there were present 482\\r\\nDeputies out of 500, the absentees remaining away on account of illness.\\r\\nThe Deputies especially applauded were those who wore military uniforms\\r\\nand who had asked permission for leave from their military duties to be\\r\\npresent at the sitting. All the tribunes were filled to overflowing. No\\r\\nrepresentatives of Germany, Austria or Turkey were to be seen in the\\r\\ndiplomatic tribune. The first envoy to arrive was Thomas Nelson Page,\\r\\nthe American Ambassador, who was accompanied by his staff. M. Barrere,\\r\\nSir J. Bennell Rodd, and Michel de Giers, the French, British and\\r\\nRussian Ambassadors, respectively, appeared a few minutes later and all\\r\\nwere greeted with applause, which was shared by the Belgian, Greek and\\r\\nRoumanian ministers. George B. McClellan, one-time mayor of New York,\\r\\noccupied a seat in the President\\'s tribune.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few minutes before the session began the poet, Gabrielle D\\'Annunzio,\\r\\none of the strongest advocates of war, appeared in the rear of the\\r\\npublic tribune which was so crowded that it seemed impossible to squeeze\\r\\nin anybody else. But the moment the people saw him they lifted him\\r\\nshoulder high and passed him over their heads to the first row.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entire chamber, and all those occupying the other tribunes, rose and\\r\\napplauded for five minutes, crying \"Viva D\\'Annunzio!\" Later thousands\\r\\nsent him their cards and in return received his autograph bearing the\\r\\ndate of this eventful day. Senor Marcora, President of the Chamber, took\\r\\nhis place at three o\\'clock. All the members of the House, and everybody\\r\\nin the galleries, stood up to acclaim the old follower of Garibaldi.\\r\\nPremier Salandra, followed by all the members of the Cabinet, entered\\r\\nshortly afterward. It was a solemn moment. Then a delirium of cries\\r\\nbroke out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Viva Salandra!\" roared the Deputies, and the cheering lasted for a long\\r\\ntime. After the formalities of the opening, Premier Salandra, deeply\\r\\nmoved by the demonstration, arose and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gentlemen, I have the honor to present to you a bill to meet the\\r\\neventual expenditures of a national war.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe announcement was greeted by further prolonged applause. The\\r\\nPremier\\'s speech was continually interrupted by enthusiasm, and at times\\r\\nhe could hardly continue on account of the wild cheering. The climax was\\r\\nreached when he made a reference to the army and navy. Then the cries\\r\\nseemed interminable, and those on the floor of the House and in the\\r\\ngalleries turned to the military tribune from which the officers\\r\\nanswered by waving their hands and handkerchiefs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the Premier\\'s speech there were deafening vivas for the\\r\\nKing, war and Italy. Thirty-four Socialists refused to join the cheers,\\r\\neven in the cry \"Viva Italia!\" and they were hooted and hissed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe action of the Italian Government created intense feeling. A\\r\\nnewspaper man in Vienna, describing the Austrian indignation, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The exasperation and contempt which Italy\\'s treacherous surprise attack\\r\\nand her hypocritical justification aroused here, are quite\\r\\nindescribable. Neither Serbia nor Russia, despite a long and costly war,\\r\\nis hated. Italy, however, or rather those Italian would-be politicians\\r\\nand business men who offer violence to the majority of peaceful Italian\\r\\npeople, are unutterably hated.\" On the other hand German papers spoke\\r\\nwith much more moderation and recognized that Italy was acting in an\\r\\nentirely natural manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the very day on which war was declared active operations were begun.\\r\\nBoth sides had been making elaborate preparations. Austria had prepared\\r\\nherself by building strong fortifications in which were employed the\\r\\nlatest technical improvements in defensive warfare. Upon the Carso and\\r\\naround Gorizia the Austrians had placed innumerable batteries of\\r\\npowerful guns mounted on rails and protected by armor plates. They also\\r\\nhad a great number of medium and smaller guns. A net of trenches had\\r\\nbeen excavated and constructed in cement all along the edge of the hills\\r\\nwhich dominated the course of the Isonzo River.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Painting: Hundreds of soldiers using ropes to drag a\\r\\nlarge gun up a mountain slope.]\\r\\n  ITALY\\'S TITANIC LABOR TO CONQUER THE ALPS\\r\\n  When the Italians were making their first mighty advance against\\r\\n  Austria descriptions came through of the almost unbelievable natural\\r\\n  obstacles they were conquering. Getting one of the monster guns into\\r\\n  position in the mountains, as shown above, over the track that had to\\r\\n  be built for every foot of its progress, was one such handicap.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Painting: Soldiers debarking from a transport under heavy\\r\\ngun fire.]\\r\\n  THE HISTORIC LANDING FROM THE \"RIVER CLYDE\" AT SEDDUL BARR\\r\\n  An incident of the Dardanelles Expedition. Horrible losses were\\r\\n  sustained by the Allied troops from the concentrated fire of the\\r\\n  Turkish machine guns on shore.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThese trenches, occupying a position nearly impregnable because so\\r\\nmountainous, were defended by every modern device. They were protected\\r\\nwith numerous machine guns, surrounded by wire entanglements through\\r\\nwhich ran a strong electric current. These lines of trenches followed\\r\\nwithout interruption from the banks of the Isonzo to the summit of the\\r\\nmountains which dominate it; they formed a kind of formidable staircase\\r\\nwhich had to be conquered step by step with enormous sacrifice.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this same period General Cadorna, then head of the Italian army,\\r\\nhad been bringing that army up to date, working for high efficiency and\\r\\npiling up munitions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Army of Italy was a formidable one. Every man in Italy is liable to\\r\\nmilitary service for a period of nineteen years from the age of twenty\\r\\nto thirty-nine.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time of the war the approximate war strength of the army was as\\r\\nfollows: Officers, 41,692; active army with the colors, 289,910;\\r\\nreserve, 638,979; mobile militia, 299,956; territorial militia,\\r\\n1,889,659; total strength, 3,159,836. The above number of total men\\r\\navailable included upward of 1,200,000 fully trained soldiers, with\\r\\nperhaps another 800,000 partially trained men, the remaining million\\r\\nbeing completely untrained men. This army was splendidly armed, its\\r\\nofficers well educated, and the men brave and disciplined.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Italian plan of campaign apparently consisted first, in neutralizing\\r\\nthe Trentino by capturing or covering the defenses and cutting the two\\r\\nlines of communication with Austria proper, the railway which ran south\\r\\nfrom Insbruck, and that which ran southwest from Vienna and joined the\\r\\nformer at Fransensfets; and second, in a movement in force on the\\r\\neastern frontier, with Trieste captured or covered on the right flank in\\r\\nthe direction of the Austrian fortress at Klagenfurt and Vienna.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first blow was struck by Austria on the day that war was declared.\\r\\nOn that day bombs were dropped on Venice, and five other Adriatic ports\\r\\nwere shelled from air, and some from sea. The Italian armies invaded\\r\\nAustria on the east with great rapidity, and by May 27th a part of the\\r\\nItalian forces had moved across the Isonzo River to Monfalcone, sixteen\\r\\nmiles northwest of Trieste. Another force penetrated further to the\\r\\nnorth in the Crown land of Gorizia, and Gradisca. Reports from Italy\\r\\nwere that encounters with the enemy had thus far been merely outpost\\r\\nskirmishes, but had allowed Italy to occupy advantageous positions on\\r\\nAustrian territory By June 1st, the Italians had occupied the greater\\r\\npart of the west bank of the Isonzo, with little opposition. The left\\r\\nwing was beyond the Isonzo, at Caporetto, fighting among the boulders of\\r\\nMonte Nero, where the Austrian artillery had strong positions.\\r\\nMonfalcone was kept under constant bombardment.\\r\\n\\r\\nA general Italian advance took place on June 7th across the Isonzo River\\r\\nfrom Caporetto to the sea, a distance of about forty miles. Monfalcone\\r\\nwas taken by the Italians on June the 10th, the first serious blow\\r\\nagainst Trieste, as Monfalcone was a railway junction, and its\\r\\nelectrical works operated the light and power of Trieste.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day the center made a great blow against Gradisca and Sagrado, but\\r\\nthe river line proved too strong. The only success was won that night at\\r\\nPlava, north of Borrigia, which was carried by a surprise attack. The\\r\\nIsonzo was in flood, and presented a serious obstacle to the onrush of\\r\\nthe Italians. By June 14th the Italian eastern army had pushed forward\\r\\nalong the gulf of Trieste toward the town of Nebrosina, nine miles from\\r\\nTrieste.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, the Austrian armies were being constantly strengthened. The\\r\\ninitial weakness of the Austrian defensive was due to the fact that the\\r\\narmies normally assigned to the invaded region had been sent to defend\\r\\nthe Austrian line in Galicia against the Russians. When Italy began her\\r\\ninvasion the defenses of the country were chiefly in the hands of\\r\\nhastily mobilized youths below the military age of nineteen, and men\\r\\nabove the military age of forty-two. From now on Austrian troops began\\r\\nto arrive from the Galician front, some of these representing the finest\\r\\nfighting material in the Austrian ranks. The chance of an easy victory\\r\\nwas slipping from Italy\\'s hands. The Italian advance was checked.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 15th of June the Italians carried an important position on Monte\\r\\nNero, climbing the rocks by night and attacking by dawn. But this\\r\\nconquest did not help much. No guns of great caliber could be carried on\\r\\nthe mountain, and Tolmino, which had been heavily fortified, and\\r\\ncontained a garrison of some thirty thousand men, was entirely safe. The\\r\\nfollowing week there were repeated counter-attacks at Plava and on Monte\\r\\nNero, but the Italians held what they had won.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map]\\r\\n  AREA OF GENERAL CADORNA\\'S SUCCESSFUL OPERATIONS AGAINST GORIZIA\\r\\n  The Isonzo valley forms the eastern line for the defense of Italy and\\r\\n  its possession was essential to the realization of Italian ideals.\\r\\n  Gorizia, its main strategic position, first fell to the Italians\\r\\n  August 9, 1916.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe position was now that Cadorna\\'s left wing was in a strong position,\\r\\nbut could not do much against Tolmino. His center was facing the great\\r\\ncamp of Gorizia, while his right was on the edge of the Carso, and had\\r\\nadvanced as far as Dueno, on the Monfalcone-Trieste Railroad. The army\\r\\nwas in position to make an attack upon Gorizia. On the 2d of July an\\r\\nattack on a broad front was aimed directly at Gorizia. The left was to\\r\\nswing around against the defenses of Gorizia to the north; the center\\r\\nwas directed against the Gorizia bridge head, and the right was to swing\\r\\naround to the northeast through the Doberdo plateau. If it succeeded the\\r\\nTrieste railway would be cut and Gorizia must fall.\\r\\n\\r\\nLong and confused fighting followed. The center and the right of the\\r\\nItalian army slowly advanced their line, taking over one thousand\\r\\nprisoners. For days there was continuous bombardment and\\r\\ncounter-bombardment. The fighting on the left was terrific. In the\\r\\nneighborhood of Plava the Italian forces found themselves opposed by\\r\\nHungarian troops, unaccustomed to mountain warfare, who at first fell\\r\\nback. Austrian reserves came to their aid, and flung back three times\\r\\nthe Italian charge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree new Italian brigades were brought up, and King Victor Emanuel\\r\\nhimself came to encourage his troops. The final assault carried the\\r\\nheights. On the 22d of July the Italian right captured the crest of San\\r\\nMichele, which dominates the Doberdo plateau.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the Austrian armies were being heavily reinforced, and General\\r\\nCadorna found himself unable to make progress. Much ground had been won\\r\\nbut Gorizia was still unredeemed. Many important vantage points were in\\r\\nItalian hands, but it was difficult to advance. The result of the three\\r\\nmonths\\' campaign was a stalemate. In the high mountains to the north\\r\\nItaly\\'s campaign was a war of defense. To undertake her offensive on the\\r\\nIsonzo it was necessary that she guard her flanks and rear. The Tyrolese\\r\\nbattle-ground contained three distinct points where it was necessary to\\r\\noperate; the Trentino Salient, the passes of the Dolomites, and the\\r\\npasses of the Carnic Alps.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in June Italy had won control of the ridges of the mountains in\\r\\nthe two latter points, but the problem in the Trentino was more\\r\\ndifficult. It was necessary, because of the converging valleys, to push\\r\\nher front well inland. On the Carnic Alps the fighting consisted of\\r\\nunimportant skirmishes. The main struggle centered around the pass of\\r\\nMonte Croce Carnico.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn two weeks the Alpini had seized dominating positions to the west of\\r\\nthe pass, but the Austrians clung to the farther slopes. A great deal of\\r\\npicturesque fighting went on, but not much progress was made. Further\\r\\nwest in the Dolomite region there was more fighting. On the 30th of May\\r\\nCartina had been captured, and the Italians moved north toward the\\r\\nPusterthal Railway. Progress was slow, as the main routes to the railway\\r\\nwere difficult.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the middle of August they were only a few miles from the railway, but\\r\\nall the routes led through defiles, and the neighboring heights were in\\r\\nthe possession of the Austrians. To capture these heights was a most\\r\\ndifficult feat, which the Italians performed in the most brilliant way;\\r\\nbut even after they had passed these defiles success was not yet won.\\r\\nEach Italian column was in its own grove, with no lateral communication.\\r\\nThe Austrians could mass themselves where they pleased. As a result the\\r\\nItalian forces were compelled to halt.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Trentino campaign the Italians soon captured the passes, and\\r\\nmoved against Trente and Roverito. These towns were heavily fortified,\\r\\nas were their surrounding heights. The campaign became a series of small\\r\\nfights on mountain peaks and mountain ridges. Only small bodies of\\r\\ntroops could maneuver, and the raising of guns up steep precipices was\\r\\nextremely difficult. The Italians slowly succeeded in gaining ground,\\r\\nand established a chain of posts around the heights so that often one\\r\\nwould see guns and barbed wire intrenchments at a height of more than\\r\\nten thousand feet among the crevasses of the glaciers. The Alpini\\r\\nperformed wonderful feats of physical endurance, but the plains of\\r\\nLombardy were still safe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XX\\r\\n\\r\\nGLORIOUS GALLIPOLI\\r\\n\\r\\nIf ever the true mettle and temper of a people were tried and\\r\\nexemplified in the crucible of battle, that battle was the naval and\\r\\nland engagement embracing Gallipoli and the Dardanelles and the people\\r\\nso tested, the British race. Separated in point of time but united in\\r\\nits general plan, the engagements present a picture of heroism founded\\r\\nupon strategic mistakes; of such perseverance and dogged determination\\r\\nagainst overwhelming natural and artificial odds as even the pages of\\r\\nsupreme British bravery cannot parallel. The immortal charge of the\\r\\nLight Brigade was of a piece with Gallipoli, but it was merely a battle\\r\\nfragment and its glorious record was written in blood within the scope\\r\\nof a comparatively few inspired minutes. In the mine-strewn Dardanelles\\r\\nand upon the sun-baked, blood-drenched rocky slopes of Gallipoli, death\\r\\nalways partnered every sailor and soldier. As at Balaklava, virtually\\r\\neveryone knew that some one had blundered, but the army and the navy as\\r\\none man fought to the bitter end to make the best of a bad bargain, to\\r\\ntear triumph out of impossibilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrance co-operated with the British in the naval engagement, but the\\r\\ngreater sacrifice, the supreme charnel house of the war, the British\\r\\nrace reserved for itself. There, the yeomanry of England, the unsung\\r\\ncounty regiments whose sacrifices and achievements have been neglected\\r\\nin England\\'s generous desire to honor the men from \"down under,\" the\\r\\nAustralians and New Zealanders grouped under the imperishable title of\\r\\nthe Anzacs--there the Scotch, Welsh and Irish knit in one devoted\\r\\nBritish Army with the great fighters from the self-governing colonies\\r\\nwaged a battle so hopeless and so gallant that the word Gallipoli shall\\r\\nalways remind the world how man may triumph over the fear of death; how\\r\\nwith nothing but defeat and disaster before them, men may go to their\\r\\ndeaths as unconcernedly as in other days they go to their nightly sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 5, 1914, Great Britain declared war upon Turkey.\\r\\nHostilities, however, had preceded the declaration. On November 3d the\\r\\ncombined French and British squadrons had bombarded the entrance forts.\\r\\nThis was merely intended to draw the fire of the forts and make an\\r\\nestimate of their power. From that time on a blockade was maintained,\\r\\nand on the 13th of December a submarine, commanded by Lieutenant\\r\\nHolbrook, entered the straits and torpedoed the Turkish warship\\r\\nMessoudieh, which was guarding the mine fields.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of January the blockading fleet, through constant\\r\\nreinforcement, had become very strong, and had seized the Island of\\r\\nTenedos and taken possession of Lemnos, which nominally belonged to\\r\\nGreece, as bases for naval operations. On the 19th of February began the\\r\\ngreat attack upon the forts at the entrance to the Dardanelles, which\\r\\nattracted the attention of the world for nearly a year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe expedition against the Dardanelles had been considered with the\\r\\ngreatest care, and approved by the naval authorities. That their\\r\\njudgment was correct, however, is another question. The history of naval\\r\\nwarfare seems to make very plain that a ship, however powerful, is at a\\r\\ntremendous disadvantage when attacking forts on land. The badly served\\r\\ncannon of Alexandria fell, indeed, before a British fleet, but Gallipoli\\r\\nhad been fortified by German engineers, and its guns were the Krupp\\r\\ncannon. The British fleet found itself opposed by unsurmountable\\r\\nobstacles. Looking backward it seems possible, that if at the very start\\r\\nLord Kitchener had permitted a detachment of troops to accompany the\\r\\nfleet, success might have been attained, but without the army the navy\\r\\nwas powerless.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Peninsula of Gallipoli is a tongue of land about fifty miles long,\\r\\nvarying in width from twelve to two or three miles. It is a mass of\\r\\nrocky hills so steep that in many places it is a matter of difficulty to\\r\\nreach their tops. On it are a few villages, but there are no decent\\r\\nroads and little cultivated land. On the southern shore of the\\r\\nDardanelles conditions are nearly the same. Here, the entrance is a flat\\r\\nand marshy plain, but east of this plain are hills three thousand feet\\r\\nhigh. The high ground overhangs the sea passage on both sides, and with\\r\\nthe exception of narrow bits of beach at their base, presents almost no\\r\\nopportunity for landing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:  Map: Gallipoli and surroundings]\\r\\n  MAP OF THE GALLIPOLI PENINSULA Showing the various landing places,\\r\\n  with inset of the Sari-Bair Region.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA strong current continually sifts down the straits from the Sea of\\r\\nMarmora.\\r\\n\\r\\nForts were placed at the entrance on both the north and south side, but\\r\\nthey were not heavily armed and were merely outposts. Fourteen miles\\r\\nfrom the mouth the straits become quite narrow, making a sharp turn\\r\\ndirectly north and then resuming their original direction. The channel\\r\\nthus makes a sharp double bend. At the entrance to the strait, known as\\r\\nthe Narrows, were powerful fortresses, and the slopes were studded with\\r\\nbatteries. Along both sides of the channel the low ground was lined with\\r\\nbatteries. It was possible to attack the forts at fairly long range, but\\r\\nthere was no room to bring any large number of ships into action at the\\r\\nsame time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time of the Gallipoli adventure there were probably nearly half a\\r\\nmillion of men available for a defense of the straits, men well armed\\r\\nand well trained under German leadership. The first step was\\r\\ncomparatively easy. The operations against the other forts began at 8\\r\\nA.M. on Friday, the 19th of February. The ships engaged were the\\r\\nInflexible, the Agamemnon, the Cornwallis, the Vengeance and the Triumph\\r\\nfrom the British fleet, and the Bouvet, Suffren, and the Gaulois from\\r\\nthe French, all under the command of Vice-Admiral Sackville Carden. The\\r\\nFrench squadron was under Rear-Admiral Gueprette. A flotilla of\\r\\ndestroyers accompanied the fleet, and airplanes were sent up to guide\\r\\nthe fire of the battleships.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first the fleet was arranged in a semicircle some miles out to sea\\r\\nfrom the entrance to the strait. It afforded an inspiring spectacle as\\r\\nthe ships came along and took up position, and the picture became most\\r\\nawe-inspiring when the guns began to boom. The bombardment at first was\\r\\nslow. Shells from the various ships screaming through the air at the\\r\\nrate of about one every two minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Turkish batteries, however, were not to be drawn, and, seeing this,\\r\\nthe British Admiral sent one British ship and one French ship close in\\r\\nshore toward the Sedd-el-Bahr forts. As they went in they sped right\\r\\nunder the guns of the shore batteries, which could no longer resist the\\r\\ntemptation to see what they could do. Puffs of white smoke dotted the\\r\\nlandscape on the far shore, and dull booms echoed over the placid water.\\r\\nAround the ships fountains of water sprang up into the air. The enemy\\r\\nhad been drawn, but his marksmanship was obviously very bad. Not a\\r\\nsingle shot directed against the ships went within a hundred yards of\\r\\neither.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt sundown on account of the failing light Admiral Carden withdrew the\\r\\nfleet. On account of the bad weather the attack was not renewed until\\r\\nFebruary 25th. It appeared that the outer forts had not been seriously\\r\\ndamaged on the 19th, and that what injury had been done had been\\r\\nrepaired. In an hour and a half the Cape Helles fort was silenced. The\\r\\nAgamemnon was hit by a shell fired at a range of six miles, which killed\\r\\nthree men and wounded five. Early in the afternoon Sedd-el-Bahr was\\r\\nattacked at close range, but not silenced till after 5 P.M. At this time\\r\\nBritish trawlers began sweeping the entrance for mines, and during the\\r\\nnext day the mine field was cleared for a distance of four miles up the\\r\\nstraits.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as this clearance was made the Albion, Vengeance and Majestic\\r\\nsteamed into the strait and attacked Fort Dardanos, a fortification some\\r\\ndistance below the Narrows. The Turks replied vigorously, not only from\\r\\nDardanos but from batteries scattered along the shore. Believing that\\r\\nthe Turks had abandoned the forts at the entrance, landing parties of\\r\\nmarines were sent to shore. In a short time, however, they met a\\r\\ndetachment of the enemy and were compelled to retreat to their boats.\\r\\nThe outer forts, however, were destroyed, and their destruction was\\r\\nextremely encouraging to the Allies.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a time a series of minor operations was carried on, meeting with\\r\\nmuch success. Besides attacks on forts inside of the strait, Smyrna was\\r\\nbombarded on March the 5th, and on March the 6th the Queen Elizabeth,\\r\\nthe Agamemnon and the Ocean bombarded the forts at Chanak on the Asiatic\\r\\nside of the Narrows, from a position in the gulf of Saros on the outer\\r\\nside of the Gallipoli Peninsula. To all of these attacks the Turks\\r\\nreplied vigorously and the attacking ships were repeatedly struck, but\\r\\nwith no loss of life. On the 7th of March Fort Dardanos was silenced,\\r\\nand Fort Chanak ceased firing, but, as it turned out, only temporarily.\\r\\n\\r\\nPreparations were now being made for a serious effort against the\\r\\nNarrows. The date of the attack was fixed for March 17th, weather\\r\\npermitting. On the 16th Admiral Carden was stricken down with illness\\r\\nand was invalided by medical authority. Admiral de Roebeck, second in\\r\\ncommand, who had been very active in the operations, was appointed to\\r\\nsucceed him. Admiral de Roebeck was in cordial sympathy with the\\r\\npurposes of the expedition and determined to attack on the 18th of\\r\\nMarch. At a quarter to eleven that morning, the Queen Elizabeth,\\r\\nInflexible, Agamemnon, Lord Nelson, the Triumph and Prince George\\r\\nsteamed up the straits towards the Narrows, and bombarded the forts of\\r\\nChanak. At 12.22 the French squadron, consisting of the Suffren,\\r\\nGaulois, Charlemagne, and Bouvet, advanced up the Dardanelles to aid\\r\\ntheir English associates.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the combined fire of the two squadrons the Turkish forts, which at\\r\\nfirst replied strongly, were finally silenced. All of the ships,\\r\\nhowever, were hit several times during this part of the action. A third\\r\\nsquadron, including the Vengeance, Irresistible, Albion, Ocean,\\r\\nSwiftshore and Majestic, then advanced to relieve the six old\\r\\nbattleships inside the strait.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the French squadron, which had engaged the forts in a most brilliant\\r\\nfashion, was passing out the Bouvet was blown up by a drifting mine and\\r\\nsank in less than three minutes, carrying with her most of her crew. At\\r\\n2.36 P.M. the relief battleships renewed the attack on the forts, which\\r\\nagain opened fire. The Turks were now sending mines down with the\\r\\ncurrent. At 4.09 the Irresistible quitted the line, listing heavily, and\\r\\nat 5.50 she sank, having probably struck a drifting mine. At 6.05 the\\r\\nOcean, also having struck a mine, sank in deep water. Practically the\\r\\nwhole of the crews were removed safely. The Gaulois was damaged by\\r\\ngunfire; the Inflexible had her forward control position hit by a heavy\\r\\nshell, which killed and wounded the majority of the men and officers at\\r\\nthat station and set her on fire. At sunset the forts were still in\\r\\naction, and during the twilight the Allied fleet slipped out of the\\r\\nDardanelles.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime, an expeditionary force was being gathered. The largest portion\\r\\nof this force came from Great Britain, but France also provided a\\r\\nconsiderable number from her marines and from her Colonial army. Both\\r\\nnations avoided, as far as possible, drawing upon the armies destined\\r\\nfor service in France.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the English army there were divisions from Australia and New Zealand\\r\\nand there were a number of Indian troops and Territorials. The whole\\r\\nforce was put under the command of General Sir Ian Hamilton. The\\r\\ncommander-in-chief on the Turkish side was the German General Liman von\\r\\nSanders, the former chief of the military mission at Constantinople. The\\r\\nbulk of the expeditionary force, which numbered altogether about a\\r\\nhundred and twenty thousand men, were, therefore, men whose presence in\\r\\nthe east did not weaken the Allied strength in the west.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great difficulty of the new plan was that it was impossible to\\r\\nsurprise the enemy. The whole Gallipoli Peninsula was so small that a\\r\\nlanding at any point would be promptly observed, and the nature of the\\r\\nground was of such a character that progress from any point must\\r\\nnecessarily be slow. The problem was therefore a simple one.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe expeditionary force gathered in Egypt during the first half of\\r\\nApril, and about the middle of the month was being sent to Lemnos.\\r\\nGermany was well aware of the English plans, and was doing all that it\\r\\ncould to provide a defense.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 23d the movement began, and about five o\\'clock in the afternoon\\r\\nthe first of the transports slowly made its way through the maze of\\r\\nshipping toward the entrance of Mudros Bay.\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately the patent apathy, which had gradually overwhelmed everyone,\\r\\nchanged to the utmost enthusiasm, and as the liners steamed through the\\r\\nfleet, their decks yellow with khaki, the crews of the warships cheered\\r\\nthem on to victory while the bands played them out with an unending\\r\\nvariety of popular airs. The soldiers in the transports answered this\\r\\nlast salutation from the navy with deafening cheers, and no more\\r\\ninspiring spectacle has ever been seen than this great expedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole of the fleet from the transports had been divided up into five\\r\\ndivisions and there were three main landings. The 29th Division\\r\\ndisembarked off the point of the Gallipoli Peninsula near Sedd-el-Bahr,\\r\\nwhere its operations were covered both from the gulf of Saros and from\\r\\nthe Dardanelles by the fire of the covering warships. The Australian and\\r\\nNew Zealand contingent disembarked north of Gaba Tepe. Further north a\\r\\nnaval division made a demonstration.\\r\\n\\r\\nAwaiting the Australians was a party of Turks who had been intrenched\\r\\nalmost on the shore and had opened up a terrific fusillade. The\\r\\nAustralian volunteers rose, as a man, to the occasion. They waited\\r\\nneither for orders nor for the boats to reach the beach, but springing\\r\\nout into the sea they went in to the shore, and forming some sort of a\\r\\nrough line rushed straight on the flashes of the enemy\\'s rifles. In less\\r\\nthan a quarter of an hour the Turks were in full flight.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the Australians and New Zealanders, or Anzacs as they are now\\r\\ngenerally known from the initials of the words Australian-New Zealand\\r\\nArmy Corps, were fighting so gallantly at Gaba Tepe, the British troops\\r\\nwere landing at the southern end of the Gallipoli Peninsula. The advance\\r\\nwas slow and difficult. The Turk was pushed back, little by little, and\\r\\nthe ground gained organized. The details of this progress, though full\\r\\nof incidents of the greatest courage and daring, need not be recounted.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June the 4th a general attack was made, preceded by heavy\\r\\nbombardments by all guns, but after terrific fighting, in which many\\r\\nprisoners were captured and great losses suffered, the net result was an\\r\\nadvance of about five hundred yards. As time went on the general\\r\\nimpression throughout the Allied countries was that the expedition had\\r\\nfailed. On June 30th the losses of the Turks were estimated at not less\\r\\nthan seventy thousand, and the British naval and military losses up to\\r\\nJune 1st, aggregated 38,635 officers and men. At that time the British\\r\\nand French allies held but a small corner of the area to be conquered.\\r\\nIn all of these attacks the part played by the Australian and New\\r\\nZealand army corps was especially notable. Reinforcements were\\r\\nrepeatedly sent to the Allies, who worked more and more feverishly as\\r\\ntime went on with the hope of aiding Russia, which was then desperately\\r\\nstruggling against the great German advance.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 17th it was reported that a landing had been made at Suvla\\r\\nBay, the extreme western point of the Peninsula. From this point it was\\r\\nhoped to threaten the Turkish communications with their troops at the\\r\\nlower end of the Peninsula. This new enterprise, however, failed to make\\r\\nany impression, and in the first part of September, vigorous Turkish\\r\\ncounter-offensives gained territory from the Franco-British troops.\\r\\nAccording to the English reports the Turks paid a terrible price for\\r\\ntheir success.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had now become evident that the expedition was a failure. The Germans\\r\\nwere already gloating over what they called the \"failure of British sea\\r\\npower,\" and English publicists were attempting to show that, though the\\r\\nenterprise had failed, the very presence of a strong Allied force at\\r\\nSaloniki had been an enormous gain. The first official announcement of\\r\\nfailure was made December 20, 1916, when it was announced that the\\r\\nBritish forces at Anzac and Suvla Bay had been withdrawn, and that only\\r\\nthe minor positions near Sedd-el-Bahr were occupied. Great Britain\\'s\\r\\nloss of officers and men at the Dardanelles up to December 11th was\\r\\n112,921, according to an announcement made in the House of Commons by\\r\\nthe Parliamentary Under Secretary for War. Besides these casualties the\\r\\nnumber of sick admitted to hospitals was 96,683. The decision to\\r\\nevacuate Gallipoli was made in the course of November by the British\\r\\nGovernment as the result of the early expressed opinion of General\\r\\nMonro, who had succeeded General Hamilton on October 28, 1915.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Monro found himself confronted with a serious problem in the\\r\\nattempt to withdraw an army of such a size from positions not more than\\r\\nthree hundred yards from the enemy\\'s trenches, and to embark on open\\r\\nbeaches every part of which was within effective range of Turkish guns.\\r\\nMoreover, the evacuation must be done gradually, as it was impossible to\\r\\nmove the whole army at once with such means of transportation as\\r\\nexisted. The plan was to remove the munitions, supplies and heavy guns\\r\\nby instalments, working only at night, carrying off at the same time a\\r\\nlarge portion of the troops, but leaving certain picked battalions to\\r\\nguard the trenches. Every endeavor had to be made for concealment. The\\r\\nplan was splendidly successful, and the Turks apparently completely\\r\\ndeceived. On December 20th the embarkation of the last troops at Suvla\\r\\nwas accomplished. The operations at Anzac were conducted in the same\\r\\nway. Only picked battalions were left to the end, and these were carried\\r\\nsafely off.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe success of the Suvla and Anzac evacuation made the position at Cape\\r\\nHelles more dangerous. The Turks were on the lookout, and it seemed\\r\\nalmost impossible that they could be again deceived. On January 7th an\\r\\nattack was made by the Turks upon the trenches, which was beaten back.\\r\\nThat night more than half the troops had left the Peninsula. The next\\r\\nday there was a heavy storm which made embarkation difficult, but it was\\r\\nnevertheless accomplished. The whole evacuation was a clever and\\r\\nsuccessful bit of work.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXI\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE GREATEST NAVAL BATTLE IN HISTORY\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany\\'s ambition for conquest at sea had been nursed and carefully\\r\\nfostered for twenty years. During the decade immediately preceding the\\r\\ndeclaration of war, it had embarked upon a policy of naval upbuilding\\r\\nthat brought it into direct conflict with England\\'s sea policy.\\r\\nThereafter it became a race in naval construction, England piling up a\\r\\nhuge debt in its determination to construct two tons of naval shipping\\r\\nto every one ton built by Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotwithstanding Great Britain\\'s efforts in this direction, Germany\\'s\\r\\nnaval experts, with the ruthless von Tirpitz at their head, maintained\\r\\nthat, given a fair seaway with ideal weather conditions favoring the low\\r\\nvisibility tactics of the German sea command, a victory for the Teutonic\\r\\nships would follow. It was this belief that drew the ships of the German\\r\\ncruiser squadron and High Seas Fleet off the coast of Jutland and Horn\\r\\nReef into the great battle that decided the supremacy of the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 31st of May, 1916, will go down in history as the date of this\\r\\ntitanic conflict. The British light cruiser Galatea on patrol duty near\\r\\nHorn Reef reported at 2.20 o\\'clock on the afternoon of that day, that it\\r\\nhad sighted smoke plumes denoting the advance of enemy vessels from the\\r\\ndirection of Helgoland Bight. Fifteen minutes later the smoke plumes\\r\\nwere in such number and volume that the advance of a considerable force\\r\\nto the northward and eastward was indicated. It was reasoned by\\r\\nVice-Admiral Beatty, to whom the Galatea had sent the news by radio,\\r\\nthat the enemy in rounding Horn Reef would inevitably be brought into\\r\\naction. The first ships of the enemy were sighted at 3.31 o\\'clock. These\\r\\nwere the battle screen of fast light cruisers. Back of these were five\\r\\nmodern battle cruisers of the highest power and armament.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe report of the battle, by an eye-witness, that was issued upon\\r\\nsemiofficial authority of the British Government, follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst Phase, 3.30 P.M. May 31st. Beatty\\'s battle cruisers, consisting of\\r\\nthe Lion, Princess Royal, Queen Mary, Tiger, Inflexible, Indomitable,\\r\\nInvincible, Indefatigable, and New Zealand, were on a southeasterly\\r\\ncourse, followed at about two miles distance by the four battleships of\\r\\nthe class known as Queen Elizabeths.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnemy light cruisers were sighted and shortly afterward the head of the\\r\\nGerman battle cruiser squadron, consisting of the new cruiser\\r\\nHindenburg, the Seydlitz, Derfflinger, Lutzow, Moltke, and possibly the\\r\\nSalamis.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeatty at once began firing at a range of about 20,000 yards (twelve\\r\\nmiles) which shortened to 16,000 yards (nine miles) as the fleets\\r\\nclosed. The Germans could see the British distinctly outlined against\\r\\nthe light yellow sky. The Germans, covered by a haze, could be very\\r\\nindistinctly made out by the British gunners.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Queen Elizabeths opened fire on one after another as they came\\r\\nwithin range. The German battle cruisers turned to port and drew away to\\r\\nabout 20,000 yards.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond Phase, 4.40 P.M. A destroyer screen then appeared beyond the\\r\\nGerman battle cruisers. The whole German High Seas Fleet could be seen\\r\\napproaching on the northeastern horizon in three divisions, coming to\\r\\nthe support of their battle cruisers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German battle cruisers now turned right around 16 points and took\\r\\nstation in front of the battleships of the High Fleet.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeatty, with his battle cruisers and supporting battleships, therefore,\\r\\nhad before him the whole of the German battle fleet, and Jellicoe was\\r\\nstill some distance away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe opposing fleets were now moving parallel to one another in opposite\\r\\ndirections, and but for a master maneuver on the part of Beatty the\\r\\nBritish advance ships would have been cut off from Jellicoe\\'s Grand\\r\\nFleet. In order to avoid this and at the same time prepare the way so\\r\\nthat Jellicoe might envelop his adversary, Beatty immediately also\\r\\nturned right around 16 points, so as to bring his ships parallel to the\\r\\nGerman battle cruisers and facing the same direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as he was around he increased to full speed to get ahead of the\\r\\nGermans and take up a tactical position in advance of their line. He was\\r\\nable to do this owing to the superior speed of the British battle\\r\\ncruisers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photographs]\\r\\n  Copyright Harris & Ewing.\\r\\n  ADMIRAL WILLIAM S.

FRENCH; Commander-in-chief of the British\\r\\n  force in France and Belgium from the beginning of the war to December,\\r\\n  1915.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJust before the turning point was reached, the Indefatigable sank, and\\r\\nthe Queen Mary and the Invincible also were lost at the turning point,\\r\\nwhere, of course, the High Seas Fleet concentrated their fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nA little earlier, as the German battle cruisers were turning the Queen\\r\\nElizabeths had in similar manner concentrated their fire on the turning\\r\\npoint and destroyed a new German battle cruiser, believed to be the\\r\\nHindenburg.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeatty had now got around and headed away with the loss of three ships,\\r\\nracing parallel to the German battle cruisers. The Queen Elizabeths\\r\\nfollowed behind engaging the main High Seas Fleet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird Phase, 5 P.M. The Queen Elizabeths now turned short to port 16\\r\\npoints in order to follow Beatty. The Warspite jammed her steering gear,\\r\\nfailed to get around, and drew the fire of six of the enemy, who closed\\r\\nin upon her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Germans claimed her as a loss, since on paper she ought to have been\\r\\nlost, but, as a matter of act, though repeatedly straddled by shell fire\\r\\nwith the water boiling up all around her, she was not seriously hit, and\\r\\nwas able to sink one of her opponents. Her captain recovered control of\\r\\nthe vessel, brought her around, and followed her consorts.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime the Barham, Valiant and Malaya turned short so as to\\r\\navoid the danger spot where the Queen Mary and the Invincible had been\\r\\nlost, and for an hour, until Jellicoe arrived, fought a delaying action\\r\\nagainst the High Seas Fleet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warspite joined them at about 5.15 o\\'clock, and all four ships were\\r\\nso successfully maneuvered in order to upset the spotting corrections of\\r\\ntheir opponents that no hits of a seriously disabling character were\\r\\nsuffered. They had the speed over their opponents by fully four knots,\\r\\nand were able to draw away from part of the long line of German\\r\\nbattleships, which almost filled up the horizon.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this time the Queen Elizabeths were steadily firing on at the flashes\\r\\nof German guns at a range which varied between 12,000 and 15,000 yards,\\r\\nespecially against those ships which were nearest them. The Germans were\\r\\nenveloped in a mist and only smoke and flashes were visible.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 5.45 half of the High Seas Fleet had been left out of range, and the\\r\\nQueen Elizabeths were steaming fast to join hands with Jellicoe.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo return to Beatty\\'s battle cruisers. They had succeeded in outflanking\\r\\nthe German battle cruisers, which were, therefore, obliged to turn a\\r\\nfull right angle to starboard to avoid being headed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeavy fighting was renewed between the opposing battle cruiser\\r\\nsquadrons, during which the Derfflinger was sunk; but toward 6 o\\'clock\\r\\nthe German fire slackened very considerably, showing that Beatty\\'s\\r\\nbattle cruisers and the Queen Elizabeths had inflicted serious damage on\\r\\ntheir immediate opponents.\\r\\n\\r\\nFourth Phase, 6 P.M. The Grand Fleet was now in sight, and, coming up\\r\\nfast in three directions, the Queen Elizabeths altered their course four\\r\\npoints to the starboard and drew in toward the enemy to allow Jellicoe\\r\\nroom to deploy into line.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grand Fleet was perfectly maneuvered and the very difficult\\r\\noperation of deploying between the battle cruisers and the Queen\\r\\nElizabeths was perfectly timed.\\r\\n\\r\\nJellicoe came up, fell in behind Beatty\\'s cruisers, and followed by the\\r\\ndamaged but still serviceable Queen Elizabeths, steamed right across the\\r\\nhead of the German fleet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first of the ships to come into action were the Revenue and the\\r\\nRoyal Oak with their fifteen-inch guns, and the Agincourt which fired\\r\\nfrom her seven turrets with the speed almost of a Maxim gun.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole British fleet had now become concentrated. They had been\\r\\nperfectly maneuvered, so as to \"cross the T\" of the High Seas Fleet,\\r\\nand, indeed, only decent light was necessary to complete their work of\\r\\ndestroying the Germans in detail. The light did improve for a few\\r\\nminutes, and the conditions were favorable to the British fleet, which\\r\\nwas now in line approximately north and south across the head of the\\r\\nGermans.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the few minutes of good light Jellicoe smashed up the first three\\r\\nGerman ships, but the mist came down, visibility suddenly failed, and\\r\\nthe defeated High Seas Fleet was able to draw off in ragged divisions.\\r\\n\\r\\nFifth Phase, Night. The Germans were followed by the British, who still\\r\\nhad them enveloped between Jellicoe on the west, Beatty on the north,\\r\\nand Evan Thomas with his three Queen Elizabeths on the south. The\\r\\nWarspite had been sent back to her base.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map]\\r\\n  HOW THE GREAT NAVAL BATTLE OF JUTLAND WAS FOUGHT\\r\\n  This chart must be taken only as a general indication of the courses\\r\\n  of the opposing fleets. Sir David Beatty with two squadrons of battle\\r\\n  cruisers and one squadron of fast battleships, first steamed southward\\r\\n  and southeastward of the German battle cruiser squadron; then,\\r\\n  sighting the German battle fleet, turned northward, afterwards bearing\\r\\n  eastward and connecting with Sir John Jellicoe\\'s battle squadron.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the night the torpedo boat destroyers heavily attacked the German\\r\\nships, and, although they lost seriously themselves, succeeded in\\r\\nsinking two of the enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordination of the units of the fleet was practically impossible to\\r\\nkeep up, and the Germans discovered by the rays of their searchlights\\r\\nthe three Queen Elizabeths, not more than 4,000 yards away.\\r\\nUnfortunately they were then able to escape between the battleships and\\r\\nJellicoe, since the British gunners were not able to fire, as the\\r\\ndestroyers were in the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo ended the Jutland battle, which was fought as had been planned and\\r\\nvery nearly a great success. It was spoiled by the unfavorable weather\\r\\nconditions, especially at the critical moment, when the whole British\\r\\nfleet was concentrated and engaged in crushing the head of the German\\r\\nline.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommenting on the engagement, Admiral Jellicoe said: \"The battle cruiser\\r\\nfleet, gallantly led by Vice-Admiral Beatty, and admirably supported by\\r\\nthe ships of the fifth battle squadron under Rear Admiral Evan-Thomas,\\r\\nfought the action under, at times, disadvantageous conditions,\\r\\nespecially in regard to light, in a manner that was in keeping with the\\r\\nbest traditions of the service.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis estimate of the German losses was: two battleships of the\\r\\ndreadnought type, one of the Deutschland type, which was seen to sink;\\r\\nthe battle cruiser Lutzow, admitted by the Germans; one battle cruiser\\r\\nof the dreadnought type, one battle cruiser seen to be so severely\\r\\ndamaged that its return was extremely doubtful; five light cruisers,\\r\\nseen to sink--one of them possibly a battleship; six destroyers seen to\\r\\nsink, three destroyers so damaged that it was doubtful if they would be\\r\\nable to reach port, and a submarine sunk. The official German report\\r\\nadmitted only eleven ships sunk; the first British report placed the\\r\\ntotal at eighteen, but Admiral Jellicoe enumerated twenty-one German\\r\\nvessels as probably lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Admiral paid a fine tribute to the German naval men: \"The enemy,\" he\\r\\nsaid, \"fought with the gallantry that was expected of him. We\\r\\nparticularly admired the conduct of those on board a disabled German\\r\\nlight cruiser which passed down the British line shortly after the\\r\\ndeployment under a heavy fire, which was returned by the only gun left\\r\\nin action. The conduct of the officers and men war entirely beyond\\r\\npraise. On all sides it is reported that the glorious traditions of the\\r\\npast were most worthily upheld; whether in the heavy ships, cruisers,\\r\\nlight cruisers, or destroyers, the same admirable spirit prevailed. The\\r\\nofficers and men were cool and determined, with a cheeriness that would\\r\\nhave carried them through anything. The heroism of the wounded was the\\r\\n\\'admiration\\' of all. I cannot adequately express the pride with which\\r\\nthe spirit of the fleet filled me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt daylight on the 1st of June the British battle fleet, being southward\\r\\nof Horn Reef, turned northward in search of the enemy vessels. The\\r\\nvisibility early on the first of June was three to four miles less than\\r\\non May 31st, and the torpedo-boat destroyers, being out of visual touch,\\r\\ndid not rejoin the fleet until 9 A.M. The British fleet remained in the\\r\\nproximity of the battlefield and near the line of approach to the German\\r\\nports until 11 A.M., in spite of the disadvantage of long distances from\\r\\nfleet bases and the danger incurred in waters adjacent to the enemy\\'s\\r\\ncoasts from submarines and torpedo craft.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe enemy, however, made no sign, and the admiral was reluctantly\\r\\ncompelled to the conclusion that the High Sea Fleet had returned into\\r\\nport. Subsequent events proved this assumption to have been correct. The\\r\\nBritish position must have been known to the enemy, as at 4 A.M. the\\r\\nfleet engaged a Zeppelin about five minutes, during which time she had\\r\\nample opportunity to note and subsequently report the position and\\r\\ncourse of the British fleet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Germans at first claimed a victory for their fleet. The test, of\\r\\ncourse, was the outcome of the battle. The fact that the German fleet\\r\\nretreated and nevermore ventured forth from beneath the protecting guns\\r\\nand mine fields around Helgoland, demonstrates beyond dispute that the\\r\\nBritish were entitled to the triumph. The German official report makes\\r\\nthe best presentation of the German case. It follows in full:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe High Sea Fleet, consisting of three battleship squadrons, five\\r\\nbattle cruisers, and a large number of small cruisers, with several\\r\\ndestroyer flotillas, was cruising in the Skagerrak on May 31 for the\\r\\npurpose, as on earlier occasions, of offering battle to the      British\\r\\nfleet. The vanguard of the small cruisers at 4.30 o\\'clock in the\\r\\nafternoon (German time) suddenly encountered ninety miles west of\\r\\nHanstholm, (a cape on the northwest coast of Jutland), a group of eight\\r\\nof the newest cruisers of the Calliope class and fifteen or twenty\\r\\nof the most modern destroyers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the German light forces and the first cruiser squadron under Vice\\r\\nAdmiral Hipper were following the British, who were retiring\\r\\nnorth-westward, the German battle cruisers sighted to the westward Vice\\r\\nAdmiral Beatty\\'s battle squadron of six ships, including four of the\\r\\nLion type and two of the Indefatigable type. Beatty\\'s squadron developed\\r\\na battle line on a southeasterly course and Vice Admiral Hipper formed\\r\\nhis line ahead on the same general course and approached for a running\\r\\nfight. He opened fire at 5.49 o\\'clock in the afternoon with heavy\\r\\nartillery at a range of 13,000 meters against the superior enemy. The\\r\\nweather was clear and light, and the sea was light with a northwest\\r\\nwind.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter about a quarter of an hour a violent explosion occurred on the\\r\\nlast cruiser of the Indefatigable type. It was caused by a heavy shell,\\r\\nand destroyed the vessel.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 6.20 o\\'clock in the afternoon five warships of the Queen Elizabeth\\r\\ntype came from the west and joined the British battle cruiser line,\\r\\npowerfully reinforcing with their fifteen-inch guns the five British\\r\\nbattle cruisers remaining after 6.20 o\\'clock. To      equalize this\\r\\nsuperiority Vice Admiral Hipper ordered the destroyers to attack the\\r\\nenemy. The British destroyers and small cruisers interposed, and a\\r\\nbitter engagement at close range ensued, in the course of which a light\\r\\ncruiser participated.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Germans lost two torpedo boats, the crews of which were rescued by\\r\\nsister ships under a heavy fire. Two British destroyers were sunk by\\r\\nartillery, and two others--the Nestor and Nomad--remained on the scene\\r\\nin a crippled condition. These later were destroyed by the main fleet\\r\\nafter German torpedo boats had rescued all the survivors.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile this engagement was in progress, a mighty explosion, caused by a\\r\\nbig shell, broke the Queen Mary, the third ship in line, asunder, at\\r\\n6.30 o\\'clock.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon thereafter the German main battleship fleet was sighted to the\\r\\nsouthward, steering north. The hostile fast squadrons thereupon turned\\r\\nnorthward, closing the first part of the fight, which lasted about an\\r\\nhour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British retired at high speed before the German fleet, which\\r\\nfollowed closely. The German battle cruisers continued the artillery\\r\\ncombat with increasing intensity, particularly with the division of the\\r\\nvessels of the Queen Elizabeth type, and in this the leading German\\r\\nbattleship division participated intermittently. The hostile ships\\r\\nshowed a desire to run in a flat curve ahead of the point of our line\\r\\nand to cross it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 7.45 o\\'clock in the evening British small cruisers and destroyers\\r\\nlaunched an attack against our battle cruisers, who avoided the\\r\\ntorpedoes by maneuvering, while the British battle cruisers retired from\\r\\nthe engagement, in which they did not participate further as far as can\\r\\nbe established. Shortly thereafter a German reconnoitering group, which\\r\\nwas parrying the destroyer attack, received an attack from the\\r\\nnortheast. The cruiser Wiesbaden was soon put out of action in this\\r\\nattack. The German torpedo flotillas immediately attacked the heavy\\r\\nships.\\r\\n\\r\\nAppearing shadow-like from the haze bank to the northeast was made out a\\r\\nlong line of at least twenty-five battleships, which at first sought a\\r\\njunction with the British battle cruisers and those of the Queen\\r\\nElizabeth type on a northwesterly to westerly course, and then turned on\\r\\nan easterly to southeasterly course.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the advent of the British main fleet, whose center consisted of\\r\\nthree squadrons of eight battleships each, with a fast division of three\\r\\nbattle cruisers of the Invincible type on the northern-end, and three of\\r\\nthe newest vessels of the Royal Sovereign class, armed with fifteen-inch\\r\\nguns, at the southern end, there began about 8 o\\'clock in the evening\\r\\nthe third section of the engagement, embracing the combat between the\\r\\nmain fleets.\\r\\n\\r\\nVice Admiral Scheer determined to attack the British main fleet, which\\r\\nhe now recognized was completely assembled and about doubly superior.\\r\\nThe German battleship squadron, headed by battle cruisers, steered first\\r\\ntoward the extensive haze bank to the      northeast, where the crippled\\r\\ncruiser Wiesbaden was still receiving a heavy fire. Around the Wiesbaden\\r\\nstubborn individual fights under quickly changing conditions now\\r\\noccurred.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe light enemy forces, supported by an armored cruiser squadron of five\\r\\nships of the Minatour, Achilles, and Duke of Edinburgh classes coming\\r\\nfrom the northeast, were encountered and apparently surprised on account\\r\\nof the decreasing visibility of our battle      cruisers and leading\\r\\nbattleship division. The squadron came under a violent and heavy fire by\\r\\nwhich the small cruisers Defense and Black Prince were sunk. The cruiser\\r\\nWarrior regained its own line a wreck and later sank. Another small\\r\\ncruiser was damaged severely.\\r\\n\\r\\n Two destroyers already had fallen victims to the attack of German\\r\\n torpedo boats against the leading British battleships and a small\\r\\n cruiser and two destroyers were damaged. The German battle cruisers and\\r\\n leading battleship division had in these engagements come under\\r\\n increased fire of the enemy\\'s battleship squadron, which, shortly after\\r\\n 8 o\\'clock, could be made out in the haze turning to the north-eastward\\r\\n and finally to the east, Germans observed, amid the artillery combat\\r\\n and shelling of great intensity, signs of the effect of good shooting\\r\\n between 8.20 and 8.30 o\\'clock particularly.      Several officers on\\r\\n German ships observed that a battleship of the Queen Elizabeth class\\r\\n blew up under conditions similar to that of the Queen Mary. The\\r\\n Invincible sank after being hit severely. A ship of the Iron Duke class\\r\\n had earlier received a torpedo hit, and      one of the Queen Elizabeth\\r\\n class was running around in a circle,  its steering apparatus\\r\\n apparently having been hit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lutzow was hit by at least fifteen heavy shells and was unable to\\r\\nmaintain its place in line. Vice Admiral Hipper, therefore,\\r\\ntrans-shipped to the Moltke on a torpedo boat and under a heavy fire.\\r\\nThe Derfflinger meantime took the lead temporarily. Parts of the German\\r\\ntorpedo flotilla attacked the enemy\\'s main fleet and heard detonations.\\r\\nIn the action the Germans lost a torpedo boat. An enemy destroyer was\\r\\nseen in a sinking condition, having been hit by a torpedo.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the first violent onslaught into the mass of the superior enemy\\r\\nthe opponents lost sight of each other in the smoke by powder clouds.\\r\\nAfter a short cessation in the artillery combat Vice Admiral Scheer\\r\\nordered a new attack by all the available forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nGerman battle cruisers, which with several light cruisers and torpedo\\r\\nboats again headed the line, encountered the enemy soon after 9 o\\'clock\\r\\nand renewed the heavy fire, which was answered by them from the mist,\\r\\nand then by the leading division of the main      fleet. Armored\\r\\ncruisers now flung themselves in a reckless onset at extreme speed\\r\\nagainst the enemy line in order to cover the attack of the torpedo\\r\\nboats. They approached the enemy line, although covered with shot from\\r\\n6,000 meters distances. Several German torpedo flotillas dashed forward\\r\\nto attack, delivered torpedoes, and returned, despite the most severe\\r\\ncounterfire, with the loss of only one boat. The bitter artillery fire\\r\\nwas again interrupted, after this second violent onslaught, by the smoke\\r\\nfrom guns and funnels.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral torpedo flotillas, which were ordered to attack somewhat later,\\r\\nfound, after penetrating the smoke cloud, that the enemy fleet was no\\r\\nlonger before them; nor, when the fleet commander again brought the\\r\\nGerman squadrons upon the southerly and southwesterly course where\\r\\nthe enemy was last seen, could our opponents be found. Only once\\r\\nmore--shortly before 10.30 o\\'clock--did the battle flare up. For a short\\r\\ntime in the late twilight German battle cruisers sighted four enemy\\r\\ncapital ships to seaward and opened fire immediately. As the two German\\r\\nbattleship squadrons attacked, the enemy turned and vanished in the\\r\\ndarkness. Older German light cruisers of the fourth reconnoissance group\\r\\nalso were engaged with the older enemy armored cruisers in a short\\r\\nfight. This ended the day battle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German divisions, which, after losing sight of the enemy, began a\\r\\nnight cruise in a southerly direction, were attacked until dawn by enemy\\r\\nlight force in rapid succession.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attacks were favored by the general strategic situation and the\\r\\nparticularly dark night.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cruiser Frauenlob was injured severely during the engagement of the\\r\\nfourth reconnoissance group with a superior cruiser force, and was lost\\r\\nfrom sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne armored cruiser of the Cressy class suddenly appeared close to a\\r\\nGerman battleship and was shot into fire after forty seconds, and sank\\r\\nin four minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Florent (?) Destroyer 60, (the names were hard to decipher in the\\r\\ndarkness and therefore were uncertainly established) and four\\r\\ndestroyers--3, 78, 06, and 27--were destroyed by our fire. One destroyer\\r\\nwas cut in two by the ram of a German battleship. Seven destroyers,\\r\\nincluding the G-30, were hit and severely damaged. These, including the\\r\\nTipperary and Turbulent, which after saving survivors, were left behind\\r\\nin a sinking condition, drifted past our line, some of them burning at\\r\\nthe bow or stern.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tracks of countless torpedoes were sighted by the German ships, but\\r\\nonly the Pommern (a battleship) fell an immediate victim to a torpedo.\\r\\nThe cruiser Rostock was hit, but remained afloat. The cruiser Elbing was\\r\\ndamaged by a German battleship during an unavoidable maneuver. After\\r\\nvain endeavors to keep the ship afloat the Elbing was blown up, but only\\r\\nafter her crew had embarked on torpedo boats. A post torpedo boat was\\r\\nstruck by a mine laid by the enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing are the statistics of the fight:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                ADMITTED LOSSES--BRITISH\\r\\nNAME                            TONNAGE  PERSONNEL\\r\\nQueen Mary (battle cruiser)      27,000  1,000\\r\\nIndefatigable (battle cruiser)   18,750    800\\r\\nInvincible (battle cruiser)      17,250    750\\r\\nDefense (armored cruiser)        14,600    755\\r\\nWarrior (armored cruiser)        13,550    704\\r\\nBlack Prince (armored cruiser)   13,550    704\\r\\nTipperary (destroyer)             1,850    150\\r\\nTurbulent (destroyer)             1,850    150\\r\\nShark (destroyer)                   950    100\\r\\nSparrowhawk (destroyer)             950    100\\r\\nArdent  (destroyer)                 950    100\\r\\nFortune (destroyer)                 950    100\\r\\nNomad (destroyer)                   950    100\\r\\nNestor (destroyer)                  950    100\\r\\n\\r\\n                                 BRITISH TOTALS\\r\\nBattle cruisers                  63,000  2,550\\r\\nArmored cruisers                 41,700  2,163\\r\\nDestroyers                        9,400    900\\r\\n                               --------  ------\\r\\nFourteen ships                  114,100  5,613\\r\\n\\r\\n                         ADMITTED LOSSES--GERMAN*\\r\\nNAME                            TONNAGE  PERSONNEL\\r\\nLutzow (battle cruiser)          26,600  1,200\\r\\nPommern (battleship)             13,200    729\\r\\nWiesbaden (cruiser)               5,600    450\\r\\nFrauenlob (cruiser)               2,715    264\\r\\nElbing (cruiser)                  5,000    450\\r\\nRostock (cruiser)                 4,900    373\\r\\nFive destroyers                   5,000    500\\r\\n\\r\\nGERMAN TOTALS\\r\\nBattle cruisers                  39,800  1,929\\r\\nCruisers                         18,215  1,537\\r\\nDestroyers                        5,000    500\\r\\n                                 ------  -----\\r\\nEleven ships                     63,015  3,966\\r\\n\\r\\n* These figures are given for what they are worth, but no one outside of\\r\\nGermany doubted but that their losses were very much greater than\\r\\nadmitted in the official report.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTOTAL LOSSES OF MEN\\r\\nBRITISH\\r\\nDead or missing.  6,104\\r\\nWounded             513\\r\\n                -------\\r\\nTotal             6,617\\r\\n\\r\\nGERMAN\\r\\nDead or missing   2,414\\r\\nWounded             449\\r\\n                -------\\r\\nTotal             2,863\\r\\n\\r\\nLOSS IN MONEY VALUE   (Rough Estimate)\\r\\nBritish   $115,000,000\\r\\nGerman     $63,000,000\\r\\n    ----------------\\r\\nTotal     $178,000,000\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the world was still puzzling over the conflicting reports of the\\r\\nBattle of Jutland came the shocking news that Field Marshal Lord Horatio\\r\\nHerbert Kitchener, the British Secretary of State for War, had perished\\r\\noff the West Orkney Islands on June 5th, through the sinking of the\\r\\nBritish cruiser Hampshire. The entire crew was also lost, except twelve\\r\\nmen, a warrant officer and eleven seamen, who escaped on a raft. Earl\\r\\nKitchener was on his way to Russia, at the request of the Russian\\r\\nGovernment, for a consultation regarding munitions to be furnished the\\r\\nRussian army. He was intending to go to Archangel and visit Petrograd,\\r\\nand expected to be back in London by June 20th. He was accompanied by\\r\\nHugh James O\\'Beirne, former Councillor of the British Embassy at\\r\\nPetrograd, O.A. Fitz-Gerald, his military secretary, Brigadier-General\\r\\nEllarshaw, and Sir Frederick Donaldson, all of whom were lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cause of the sinking of the Hampshire is not known. It is supposed\\r\\nthat it struck a mine, but the tragedy very naturally brought into\\r\\nexistence many stories which ascribe his death to more direct German\\r\\naction.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeaman Rogerson, one of the survivors, describes Lord Kitchener\\'s last\\r\\nmoments as follows: \"Of those who left the ship, and have survived, I\\r\\nwas the one who saw Lord Kitchener last. He went down with the ship, he\\r\\ndid not leave her. I saw Captain Seville help his boat\\'s crew to clear\\r\\naway his galley. At the same time the Captain was calling to Lord\\r\\nKitchener to come to the boat, but owing to the noise made by the wind\\r\\nand sea, Lord Kitchener could not hear him, I think. When the explosion\\r\\noccurred, Kitchener walked calmly from the Captain\\'s cabin, went up the\\r\\nladder and on to the quarter deck. There I saw him walking quite\\r\\ncollectedly, talking to two of the officers. All three were wearing\\r\\nkhaki and had no overcoats on. Kitchener calmly watched the preparations\\r\\nfor abandoning the ship, which were going on in a steady and orderly\\r\\nway. The crew just went to their stations, obeyed orders, and did their\\r\\nbest to get out the boats. But it was impossible. Owing to the rough\\r\\nweather, no boats could be lowered. Those that were got out were smashed\\r\\nup at once. No boats left the ship. What people on the shore thought to\\r\\nbe boats leaving, were rafts. Men did get into the boats as these lay in\\r\\ntheir cradles, thinking that as the ship went under the boats would\\r\\nfloat, but the ship sank by the head, and when she went she turned a\\r\\nsomersault forward, carrying down with her all the boats and those in\\r\\nthem. I do not think Kitchener got into a boat. When I sprang to a raft\\r\\nhe was still on the starboard side of the quarter deck, talking with the\\r\\nofficers. From the little time that elapsed between my leaving the ship\\r\\nand her sinking I feel certain Kitchener went down with her, and was on\\r\\ndeck at the time she sank.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map]\\r\\n  WHERE EARL KITCHENER MET HIS DEATH\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British Admiralty, after investigation, gave out a statement\\r\\ndeclaring that the vessel struck a mine, and sank about fifteen minutes\\r\\nafter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe news of Lord Kitchener\\'s death shocked the whole Allied world. He\\r\\nwas the most important personality in the British Empire. He had built\\r\\nup the British army, and his name was one to conjure by. His efficiency\\r\\nwas a proverb, and he had an air of mystery about him that made him a\\r\\nsort of a popular hero. He was great before the World War began; he was\\r\\nthe conqueror of the Soudan; the winner of the South African campaign;\\r\\nthe reorganizer of Egypt. In his work as Secretary of War he had met\\r\\nwith some criticism, but he possessed, more than any other man, the\\r\\npublic confidence. At the beginning of the war he was appointed\\r\\nSecretary of War at the demand of an overwhelming public opinion. He\\r\\nrealized more than any one else what such a war would mean. When others\\r\\nthought of it as an adventure to be soon concluded, he recognized that\\r\\nthere would be years of bitter conflict. He asked England to give up its\\r\\ncherished tradition of a volunteer army; to go through arduous military\\r\\ntraining; he saw the danger to the Empire, and he alone, perhaps, had\\r\\nthe authority to inspire his countrymen with the will to sacrifice. But\\r\\nhis work was done. The great British army was in the field.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXII\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE RUSSIAN CAMPAIGN\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the very beginning Russia had marked out one point for attack. This\\r\\nwas the city of Cracow. No doubt the Grand Duke Nicholas had not hoped\\r\\nto be able to invest that city early. The slowness of the mobilization\\r\\nof the Russian army made a certain prudence advisable at the beginning\\r\\nof the campaign. But the great success of his armies in Lemberg\\r\\nencouraged more daring aims. He had invested Przemysl, and Galicia lay\\r\\nbefore him. Accordingly, he set his face toward Cracow.\\r\\n\\r\\nCracow, from a military point of view, is the gate both of Vienna and\\r\\nBerlin. A hundred miles west of it is the famous gap of Moravia, between\\r\\nthe Carpathian and the Bohemian mountains, which leads down into\\r\\nAustria. Through this gap runs the great railway connecting Silesia with\\r\\nVienna, and the Grand Duke knew that if he could capture Cracow he would\\r\\nhave an easy road before him to the Austrian capital. Cracow also is the\\r\\nkey of Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeventy miles from the city lies the Oder River. An army might enter\\r\\nGermany by this gate and turn the line of Germany\\'s frontier fortresses.\\r\\nThe Oder had been well fortified, but an invader coming from Cracow\\r\\nmight move upon the western bank. The Russian plan no doubt was to\\r\\nthreaten both enemy capitals. Moreover, an advance of Russia from Cracow\\r\\nwould take its armies into Silesia, full of coal and iron mines, and one\\r\\nof the greatest manufacturing districts in the German Empire. This would\\r\\nbe a real success, and all Germany would feel the blow.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother reason for the Russian advance in Galicia was her desire to\\r\\ncontrol the Galician oil wells. To Germany petrol had become one of the\\r\\nforemost munitions of war. Since she could not obtain it from either\\r\\nAmerica or Russia she must get it from Austria, and the Austrian oil\\r\\nfields were all in Galicia. This, in itself, would explain the Galician\\r\\ncampaign. Moreover, through the Carpathian Mountains it was possible to\\r\\nmake frequent raids into Hungary, and Russia understood well the feeling\\r\\nof Hungary toward her German allies.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hoped that when Hungary perceived her regiments sacrificed and her\\r\\nplains overrun by Russian troops, she would regret that she had allowed\\r\\nherself to be sacrificed to Prussian ambition. The Russians, therefore,\\r\\nsuddenly, moved toward Cracow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen von Hindenburg came to the rescue. The supreme command of the\\r\\nAustrian forces was given to him. The defenses of Cracow were\\r\\nstrengthened under the direction of the Germans, and a German army\\r\\nadvanced from the Posen frontier toward the northern bank of the\\r\\nVistula. The advance threatened the Russian right, and, accordingly,\\r\\nwithin ten days\\' march of Cracow, the Russians stopped. The German\\r\\noffensive in Poland had begun. The news of the German advance came about\\r\\nthe fifth of October. Von Hindenburg, who had been fighting in East\\r\\nPrussia, had at last perceived that nothing could be gained there. The\\r\\nvulnerable part of Russia was the city of Warsaw. This was the capital\\r\\nof Poland, with a population of about three-quarters of a million. If he\\r\\ncould take Warsaw, he would not only have pleasant quarters for the\\r\\nwinter but Russia would be so badly injured that no further offensive\\r\\nfrom her need be anticipated for a long period. Von Hindenburg had with\\r\\nhim a large army. In his center he probably had three-quarters of a\\r\\nmillion men, and on his right the Austrian army in Cracow, which must\\r\\nhave reached a million.\\r\\n\\r\\nCounting the troops operating in East Prussia and along the Carpathians,\\r\\nand the garrison of Przemysl, the Teuton army must have had two and a\\r\\nhalf million soldiers. Russia, on the other hand, though her\\r\\nmobilization was still continuing, at this time could not have had as\\r\\nmany as two million men in the whole nine hundred miles of her battle\\r\\nfront.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fight for Warsaw began Friday, October 16th, and continued for three\\r\\ndays, von Hindenburg being personally in command. On Monday the Germans\\r\\nfound themselves in trouble. A Russian attack on their left wing had\\r\\ncome with crushing force. Von Hindenburg found his left wing thrown\\r\\nback, and the whole German movement thrown into disorder. Meanwhile an\\r\\nattempt to cross the Vistula at Josefov had also been a failure. The\\r\\nRussians allowed the Germans to pass with slight resistance, waited\\r\\nuntil they arrived at the village Kazimirjev, a district of low hills\\r\\nand swampy flats, and then suddenly overwhelmed them.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day the Russians crossed the river themselves, and advanced along\\r\\nthe whole line, driving the enemy before them, through great woods of\\r\\nspruce out into the plains on the west. This forest region was well\\r\\nknown to the Russian guides, and the Germans suffered much as the\\r\\nRussians had suffered in East Prussia. Ruzsky, the Russian commander,\\r\\npursued persistently; the Germans retreating first to Kielce, whence\\r\\nthey were driven, on the 3d of November, with great losses, and then\\r\\nbeing broken into two pieces, with the north retiring westward and the\\r\\nsouth wing southwest toward Cracow.\\r\\n\\r\\nRennenkampf\\'s attack on the German left wing was equally successful, and\\r\\nvon Hindenburg was driven into full retreat. The only success won during\\r\\nthis campaign was that in the far south where Austrian troops were\\r\\nsweeping eastward toward the San. This army drove back the Russians\\r\\nunder Ivanov, reoccupied Jaroslav and relieved Przemysl. This was a\\r\\nwelcome relief to Przemysl, for the garrison was nearly starved, and it\\r\\nwas well for the garrison that the relief came, for in a few days the\\r\\nRussians returned, recaptured Jaroslav and reinvested Przemysl. As von\\r\\nHindenburg retreated he left complete destruction in his wake, roads,\\r\\nbridges, railroad tracks, water towers, railway stations, all were\\r\\ndestroyed; even telegraph posts, broken or sawn through, and insulators\\r\\nbroken to bits.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now the turn of Russia to make a premature advance, and to pay\\r\\nfor it. Doubtless the Grand Duke Nicholas, whose strategy up to this\\r\\npoint had been so admirable, knew very well the danger of a new advance\\r\\nin Galicia, but he realized the immense political as well as military\\r\\nadvantages which were to be obtained by the capture of Cracow. He\\r\\ntherefore attempted to move an army through Poland as well as through\\r\\nGalicia, hoping that the army in Poland would keep von Hindenburg busy,\\r\\nwhile the Galician army would deal with Cracow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe advance was slow on account of the damaged Polish roads. It was\\r\\npreceded by a cavalry screen which moved with more speed. On November\\r\\n10th, the vanguard crossed the Posen frontier and cut the railway on the\\r\\nCracow-Posen line. This reconnaissance convinced the Russian general\\r\\nthat the German army did not propose to make a general stand, and it\\r\\nseemed to him that if he struck strongly with his center along the\\r\\nWarta, he might destroy the left flank of the German southern army,\\r\\nwhile his own left flank was assaulting Cracow. He believed that even if\\r\\nhis attack upon the Warta failed, the Russian center could at any rate\\r\\nprevent the enemy from interfering with the attack further south upon\\r\\nCracow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe movement therefore began, and by November 12th, the Russian cavalry\\r\\nhad taken Miechow on the German frontier, about twenty miles north of\\r\\nCracow. Its main forces were still eighty miles to the east. About this\\r\\ntime Grand Duke Nicholas perceived that von Hindenburg was preparing a\\r\\ncounter stroke. He had retreated north, and then, by means of his\\r\\nrailways, was gathering a large army at Thorn. Large reinforcements were\\r\\nsent him, some from the western front, giving him a total of about eight\\r\\nhundred thousand men. In his retreat from Warsaw, while he had destroyed\\r\\nall roads and railways in the south and west, he had carefully preserved\\r\\nthose of the north already planning to use them in another movement. He\\r\\nnow was beginning an advance, once again, against Warsaw. On account of\\r\\nthe roads he perceived that it would be difficult for the Russians to\\r\\nobtain reinforcements. Von Hindenburg had with him as Chief of Staff\\r\\nGeneral von Ludendorff, one of the cleverest staff officers in the\\r\\nGerman army, and General von Mackensen, a commander of almost equal\\r\\nrepute.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russian army in the north had been pretty well scattered. The\\r\\nRussian forces were now holding a front of nearly a thousand miles, with\\r\\nabout two million men. The Russian right center, which now protected\\r\\nWarsaw from the new attack could hardly number more than two hundred\\r\\nthousand men. Von Hindenburg\\'s aim was Warsaw only, and did not affect\\r\\ndirectly the Russian advance to Cracow, which was still going on.\\r\\nIndeed, by the end of the first week in December, General Dmitrieff had\\r\\ncavalry in the suburbs of Cracow, and his main force was on the line of\\r\\nthe River Rava about twelve miles away. Cracow had been strongly\\r\\nfortified, and much entrenching had been done in a wide circle around\\r\\nthe city.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph]\\r\\n  Copyright Press Illustrating Service.\\r\\n  THE FAMOUS WITHERED ARM\\r\\n  A most unusual photograph of the ex-Kaiser showing his withered left\\r\\n  arm.

Two separate forces were used; one moving southwest of\\r\\nCracow along the Carpathian hills, struck directly at Ivanov\\'s left; the\\r\\nother, operating from Hungary, threatened the Russian rear. These two\\r\\ndivisions struck at the same time and the Russians found it necessary to\\r\\nfight rear actions as they moved forward. They were doing this with\\r\\nreasonable success and working their way toward Cracow, when, on the\\r\\n12th of December, the Austrian forces working from Hungary carried the\\r\\nDukla Pass. This meant that the Austrians would be able to pour troops\\r\\ndown into the rear of the Russian advance, and the Russian army would be\\r\\ncut off. Dmitrieff, therefore, fell rapidly back, until the opening of\\r\\nthe Dukla Pass was in front of his line, and the Russian army was once\\r\\nmore safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the renewed siege of Przemysl was going on with great vigor,\\r\\nand attracting the general attention of the Allied world. The Austrians\\r\\nattempted to follow up their successes at the Dukla Pass by attempting\\r\\nto seize the Lupkow Pass, and the Uzzok Pass, still further to the east,\\r\\nbut the Russians were tired of retreating. New troops had arrived, and\\r\\nabout the 20th of December a new advance was begun.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the right of the army swinging up along the river Nida, northeast\\r\\nof Cracow, the Russian left attacked the Dukla Pass in great force,\\r\\ndriving Austrians back and capturing over ten thousand men. On Christmas\\r\\nDay all three great western passes were in Russian hands. The Austrian\\r\\nfighting, during this period, was the best they had so far shown, the\\r\\nbrunt of it being upon the Hungarian troops, who, at this time, were\\r\\nsaving Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime von Hindenburg was pursuing his movement in the direction of\\r\\nWarsaw. The Russian generals found it difficult to obtain information.\\r\\nEach day came the chronicle of contests, some victories, some defeats,\\r\\nand it soon appeared that a strong force was crushing in the Russian\\r\\noutposts from the direction of Thorn and moving toward Warsaw. Ruzsky\\r\\nfound himself faced by a superior German force, and was compelled to\\r\\nretreat. The Russian aim was to fall back behind the river Bzura, which\\r\\nlies between the Thorn and Warsaw. Bzura is a strong line of defense,\\r\\nwith many fords but no bridges. The Russian right wing passed by the\\r\\ncity of Lowicz, moved southwest to Strykov and then on past Lodz. West\\r\\nof Lowicz is a great belt of marshes impossible for the movement of\\r\\narmies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first German objective was the city of Lodz. Von Hindenburg knew\\r\\nthat he must move quickly before the Russians should get up reserves.\\r\\nHis campaign of destruction had made it impossible for aid to be sent to\\r\\nthe Russian armies from Ivanov, far in the south, but every moment\\r\\ncounted. His right pushed forward and won the western crossings of the\\r\\nmarshes. His extreme left moved towards Plock, but the main effort was\\r\\nagainst Piontek, where there is a famous causeway engineered for heavy\\r\\ntransport through the marshes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first the Russians repelled the attack on the causeway, but on\\r\\nNovember 19th the Russians broke and were compelled to fall back. Over\\r\\nthe causeway, then, the German troops were rushed in great numbers,\\r\\nsplitting the Russian army into two parts; one on the south surrounding\\r\\nLodz, and the other running east of Brezin on to the Vistula. The\\r\\nRussian army around Lodz was assailed on the front flank and rear. It\\r\\nlooked like an overwhelming defeat for the Russian army. At the very\\r\\nlast moment possible, Russian reinforcements appeared--a body of\\r\\nSiberians from the direction of Warsaw. They were thrown at once into\\r\\nthe battle and succeeded in re-establishing the Russian line. This left\\r\\nabout ninety thousand Germans almost entirely surrounded, as if they\\r\\nwere in a huge sack. Ruzsky tried his best to close the mouth of the\\r\\nsack, but he was unsuccessful. The fighting was terrific, but by the\\r\\n26th the Germans in the sack had escaped.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Germans were continually receiving reinforcements and still largely\\r\\noutnumbered the Russians. Von Hindenburg therefore determined on a new\\r\\nassault. The German left wing was now far in front of the Russian city\\r\\nof Lodz, one of the most important of the Polish cities. The population\\r\\nwas about half a million. Such a place was a constant danger, for it was\\r\\nthe foundation of a Russian salient.  When the German movement began the\\r\\nRussian general, perceiving how difficult it would have been to hold the\\r\\ncity, deliberately withdrew, and on December 6th the Germans entered\\r\\nLodz without opposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe retreat relieved the Russians of a great embarrassment. Its capture\\r\\nwas considered in Germany as a great German victory, and at this time\\r\\nvon Hindenburg seems to have felt that he had control of the situation.\\r\\nHis movement, to be sure, had not interfered with the Russian advance on\\r\\nCracow, but Warsaw must have seemed to him almost in his power. He\\r\\ntherefore concentrated his forces for a blow at Warsaw. His first new\\r\\nmovement was directed at the Russian right wing, which was then north of\\r\\nthe Bzura River and east of Lowicz. He also directed the German forces\\r\\nin East Prussia to advance and attempted to cut the main railway line\\r\\nbetween Warsaw and Petrograd. If this attempt had been successful it\\r\\nwould have been a highly serious matter for the Russians. The Russians,\\r\\nhowever, defeated it, and drove the enemy back to the East Prussian\\r\\nborder. The movement against the Russian right wing was more successful,\\r\\nand the Russians fell back slowly. This was not because they were\\r\\ndefeated in battle, but because the difficult weather interfered with\\r\\ncommunications. There had been a thaw, and the whole country was\\r\\nwaterlogged. The Grand Duke was willing that the Germans should fight in\\r\\nthe mud.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis slow retreat continued from the 7th of December to Christmas Eve,\\r\\nand involved the surrender of a number of Polish towns, but it left the\\r\\nRussians in a strong position. They were able to entrench themselves so\\r\\nthat every attack of the enemy was broken. The Germans tried hard. Von\\r\\nHindenburg would have liked to enter Warsaw on Christmas. The citizens\\r\\nheard day and night the sound of the cannon, but they were entirely\\r\\nsafe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German attack was a failure. On the whole, the Grand Duke Nicholas\\r\\nhad shown better strategy than the best of the German generals.\\r\\nOutnumbered from the very start, his tactics had been admirable. Twice\\r\\nhe had saved Warsaw, and he was still threatening Cracow. The Russian\\r\\narmies were fighting with courage and efficiency, and were continually\\r\\ngrowing in numbers as the days went by.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the first weeks of 1915 while there were a number of attacks and\\r\\ncounter attacks both armies had come to the trench warfare, so familiar\\r\\nin France. The Germans in particular had constructed a most elaborate\\r\\ntrench system, with underground rooms containing many of the ordinary\\r\\ncomforts of life. Toward the end of the month the Russians began to move\\r\\nin East Prussia in the north and also far south in the Bukovina. The\\r\\nobject of these movements was probably to prevent von Hindenburg from\\r\\nreleasing forces on the west. Russia was still terribly weak in\\r\\nequipment and was not ready for a serious advance. An attack on sacred\\r\\nEast Prussia would stir up the Germans, while Hungary would be likewise\\r\\ndisturbed by the advance on Bukovina. Von Hindenburg, however, was still\\r\\nfull of the idea of capturing Warsaw. He had failed twice but the old\\r\\nField Marshal was stubborn and moreover he knew well what the capture of\\r\\nWarsaw would mean to Russia, and so he tried again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russian front now followed the west bank of the Bzura for a few\\r\\nmiles, changed to the eastern bank following the river until it met with\\r\\nthe Rawka, from there a line of trenches passed south and east of\\r\\nBalinov and from there to Skiernievice. Von Mackensen concentrated a\\r\\nconsiderable army at Balinov and had on the 1st of February about a\\r\\nhundred and forty thousand men there. That night, with the usual\\r\\nartillery preparation, he moved from Balinov against the Russian\\r\\nposition at the Borzymov Crest. The Germans lost heavily but drove\\r\\nforward into the enemy\\'s line, and by the 3d of February had almost made\\r\\na breach in it. This point, however, could be readily reinforced and\\r\\ntroops were hurried there from Warsaw in such force that on February 4th\\r\\nthe German advance was checked. Von Mackensen had lost heavily, and by\\r\\nthe time it was checked he had become so weak that his forces yielded\\r\\nquickly to the counter-attack and were flung back.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the last frontal attack upon Warsaw. Von Hindenburg then\\r\\ndetermined to attack Warsaw by indirection. Austria was instructed to\\r\\nmove forward along the whole Carpathian front, while he himself, with\\r\\nstrong forces, undertook to move from East Prussia behind the Polish\\r\\ncapital, and cut the communications between Warsaw and Petrograd. If\\r\\nAustria could succeed, Przemysl might be relieved, Lemberg recaptured,\\r\\nand Russia forced back so far on the south that Warsaw would have to be\\r\\nabandoned. On the other hand if the East Prussia effort were successful,\\r\\nthe Polish capital would certainly fall. These plans, if they had\\r\\ndeveloped successfully, would have crippled the power of Russia for at\\r\\nleast six months. Meantime, troops could be sent to the west front, and\\r\\nperhaps enable Germany to overwhelm France. By this time almost all of\\r\\nPoland west of the Vistula was in the power of the Germans, while\\r\\nthree-fourths of Galicia was controlled by Russia.\\r\\n\\r\\nVon Hindenburg now returned to his old battle-ground near the Masurian\\r\\nLakes. The Russian forces, which, at the end of January, had made a\\r\\nforward movement in East Prussia, had been quite successful. Their right\\r\\nwas close upon Tilsit, and their left rested upon the town of\\r\\nJohannisburg. Further south was the Russian army of the Narev. Von\\r\\nHindenburg determined to surprise the invaders, and he gathered an army\\r\\nof about three hundred thousand men to face the Russian forces which did\\r\\nnot number more than a hundred and twenty thousand, and which were under\\r\\nthe command of General Baron Sievers. The Russian army soon found itself\\r\\nin a desperate position. A series of bitter fights ensued, at some of\\r\\nwhich the Kaiser himself was present. The Russians were driven steadily\\r\\nback for a week, but the German stories of their tremendous losses are\\r\\nobviously unfounded. They retreated steadily until February 20th,\\r\\nfighting courageously, and by that date the Germans began to find\\r\\nthemselves exhausted.\\r\\n\\r\\nRussian reinforcements came up, and a counter-attack was begun. The\\r\\nGerman aim had evidently been to reach Grodno and cut the main line from\\r\\nWarsaw to Petrograd, which passes through that city. They had now\\r\\nreached Suwalki, a little north of Grodno, but were unable to advance\\r\\nfurther, though the Warsaw-Petrograd railway was barely ten miles away.\\r\\nThe southern portion of von Hindenburg\\'s army was moving against the\\r\\nrailway further west, in the direction of Ossowietz. But Ossowietz put\\r\\nup a determined resistance, and the attack was unsuccessful. By the\\r\\nbeginning of March, von Hindenburg ordered a gradual retreat to the East\\r\\nPrussian frontier.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile this movement to drive the Russians from East Prussia was under\\r\\nway, von Hindenburg had also launched an attack against the Russian army\\r\\non the Narev. If he could force the lower Narev from that point, too, he\\r\\ncould cut the railroad running east from the Polish capital. He had\\r\\nhoped that the attacks just described further east would distract the\\r\\nRussian attention so that he would find the Narev ill guarded. The\\r\\nadvance began on February 22d, and after numerous battles captured\\r\\nPrzasnysz, and found itself with only one division to oppose its\\r\\nprogress to the railroad. On the 23d this force was attacked by the\\r\\nGerman right, but resisted with the utmost courage. It held out for more\\r\\nthan thirty-six hours, until, on the evening of the 24th, Russian\\r\\nreinforcements began to come up, and drove the invaders north through\\r\\nPrzasnysz in retreat.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was an extraordinary fight. The Russians were unable to supply all\\r\\ntheir troops with munitions and arms. At Przasnysz men fought without\\r\\nrifles, armed only with a bayonet. All they could do was to charge with\\r\\ncold steel, and they did it so desperately that, though they were\\r\\noutnumbered, they drove the Germans before them. By all the laws of war\\r\\nthe Russians should have been defeated with ease. As it was, the German\\r\\nattempt to capture Warsaw by a flank movement was defeated. While the\\r\\nstruggle was going on in the north, the Austrian armies in Galicia were\\r\\nalso moving, Russia was still holding the three great passes in the\\r\\nCarpathian Mountains, but had not been able to begin an offensive in\\r\\nHungary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Austrians had been largely reinforced by German troops, and were\\r\\nmoving forward to the relief of Przemysl, and also to drive Brussilov\\r\\nfrom the Galician mountains. Brussilov\\'s movements had been partly\\r\\nmilitary and partly political. From the passes in those mountains\\r\\nHungary could be attacked, and unless he could be driven away there was\\r\\nno security for the Hungarian cornfields, to which Germany was looking\\r\\nfor food supplies. Moreover, from the beginning of the Russian movement\\r\\nin Galicia, northern Bukovina had been in Russian hands. Bukovina was\\r\\nnot only a great supply ground for petrol and grain, but she adjoined\\r\\nRoumania which, while still neutral, had a strong sympathy with the\\r\\nAllies, especially Italy. The presence of a Russian army on her border\\r\\nmight encourage her to join the Allies. Austria naturally desired to\\r\\nfree Roumania from this pressure. The leading Austrian statesmen, at\\r\\nthis time, were especially interested in Hungary. The Austrian Minister\\r\\nof Foreign Affairs was Baron Stephen Burian, the Hungarian diplomatist,\\r\\nbelonging to the party of the Hungarian Premier, Count Tisza. It was his\\r\\nown country that was threatened. The prizes of a victorious campaign\\r\\nwere therefore great.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe campaign began in January amid the deepest snow, and continued\\r\\nduring February in the midst of blizzards. The Austrians were divided\\r\\ninto three separate armies. The first was charged with the relief of\\r\\nPrzemysl. The second advanced in the direction of Lemberg, and the third\\r\\nmoved upon Bukovina. The first made very little progress, after a number\\r\\nof lively battles. It was held pretty safely by Brussilov. The second\\r\\narmy was checked by Dmitrieff. Further east, however, the army of the\\r\\nBukovina crossed the Carpathian range, and made considerable advances.\\r\\nThis campaign was fought out in a great number of battles, the most\\r\\nserious of which, perhaps, was the battle of Koziowa. At that point\\r\\nBrussilov\\'s center withstood for several days the Austrian second army\\r\\nwhich was commanded by the German General von Linsengen. The Russian\\r\\nsuccess here saved Lemberg, prevented the relief of Przemysl and gave\\r\\ntime to send reinforcements into Bukovina.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Austrian third army, moving on Bukovina, had the greatest Austrian\\r\\nsuccess. They captured in succession Czernowitz, Kolomea, and Stanislau.\\r\\nThey did not succeed, however, in driving the Russians from the\\r\\nprovince. The Russians retired slowly, waiting for reinforcements. These\\r\\nreinforcements came, whereupon the Austrians were pushed steadily back.\\r\\nThe passes in the Carpathians still remained in Austrian hands, but\\r\\nPrzemysl was not relieved or Lemberg recaptured. On March 22d Przemysl\\r\\nfell.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe capture of Przemysl was the greatest success that Russia had so far\\r\\nattained. It had been besieged for about four months, and the taking of\\r\\nthe fortress was hailed as the first spectacular success of the war. Its\\r\\ncapture altered the whole situation. It released a large Russian army,\\r\\nwhich was sent to reinforce the armies of Ivanov, where the Austrians\\r\\nwere vigorously attacked.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of March the Russians had captured the last Austrian position\\r\\non the Lupkow pass and were attacking vigorously the pass of Uzzok,\\r\\nwhich maintained a stubborn defense. Brussilov tried to push his way to\\r\\nthe rear of the Uzzok position, and though the Austrians delivered a\\r\\nvigorous counter-attack they were ultimately defeated. In five weeks of\\r\\nfighting Ivanov captured over seventy thousand prisoners.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this period there was considerable activity in East Prussia, and\\r\\nthe Courland coast was bombarded by the German Baltic squadron. There\\r\\nwas every indication that Austria was near collapse, but all the time\\r\\nthe Germans were preparing for a mighty effort, and the secret was kept\\r\\nwith extraordinary success. The little conflicts in the Carpathians and\\r\\nin East Prussia were meant to deceive, while a great army, with an\\r\\nenormous number of guns of every caliber, and masses of ammunition, were\\r\\nbeing gathered. The Russian commanders were completely deceived. There\\r\\nhad been no change in the generals in command except that General\\r\\nRuzsky, on account of illness, was succeeded by General Alexeiev. The\\r\\nnew German army was put under the charge of von Hindenburg\\'s former\\r\\nlieutenant, General von Mackensen. This was probably the strongest army\\r\\nthat Germany ever gathered, and could not have numbered less than two\\r\\nmillions of men, with nearly two thousand pieces in its heavy batteries.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 28th, the action began. The Austro-German army lay along the\\r\\nleft of the Donajetz River to its junction with the Biala, and along the\\r\\nBiala to the Carpathian Mountains. Von Mackensen\\'s right moved in the\\r\\ndirection of Gorlice. General Dmitrieff was compelled to weaken his\\r\\nfront to protect Gorlice and then, on Saturday, the 1st of May, the\\r\\ngreat attack began. Under cover of artillery fire such as had never been\\r\\nseen before bridges were pushed across the Biala and Ciezkowice was\\r\\ntaken. The Russian positions were blown out of existence. The Russian\\r\\narmies did what they could but their defense collapsed and they were\\r\\nsoon in full retreat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German armies advanced steadily, and though the Russians made a\\r\\nbrave stand at many places they could do nothing. On the Wisloka they\\r\\nhung on for five days, but they were attempting an impossibility. From\\r\\nthat time on each day marked a new German victory, and in spite of the\\r\\nmost desperate fighting the Russians were forced back until, on the\\r\\n11th, the bulk of their line lay just west of the lower San as far as\\r\\nPrzemysl and then south to the upper Dniester. The armies were in\\r\\nretreat, but were not routed. In a fortnight the army of Dmitrieff had\\r\\nfallen back eighty-five miles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grand Duke Nicholas by this time understood the situation. He\\r\\nperceived that it was impossible to make a stand. The only thing to do\\r\\nwas to retreat steadily until Germany\\'s mass of war material should be\\r\\nused up, even though miles of territory should be sacrificed. It should\\r\\nbe a retreat in close contact with the enemy, so that the Austro-German\\r\\ntroops would have to fight for every mile. This meant a retreat not for\\r\\ndays, but perhaps for weeks. It meant that Przemysl must be given up,\\r\\nand Lemberg, and even Warsaw, but the safety of the Russian army was of\\r\\nmore importance than a province or a city.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 18th the German War Office announced their successes in the\\r\\nfollowing terms: \"The army under General von Mackensen in the course of\\r\\nits pursuit of the Russians reached yesterday the neighborhood of\\r\\nSubiecko, on the lower Wisloka, and Kolbuezowa, northeast of Debica.\\r\\nUnder the pressure of this advance the Russians also retreated from\\r\\ntheir positions north of the Vistula. In this section the troops under\\r\\nGeneral von Woyrach, closely following the enemy, penetrated as far as\\r\\nthe region northwest of Kielce. In the Carpathians Austro-Hungarian and\\r\\nGerman troops under General von Linsingen conquered the hills east of\\r\\nthe Upper Stryi, and took 3,660 men prisoners, as well as capturing six\\r\\nmachine guns. At the present moment, while the armies under General von\\r\\nMackensen are approaching the Przemysl fortresses and the lower San, it\\r\\nis possible to form an approximate idea of the booty taken. In the\\r\\nbattles of Tarno and Gorlika, and in the battles during the pursuit of\\r\\nthese armies, we have so far taken 103,500 Russian prisoners, 69 cannon,\\r\\nand 255 machine guns. In these figures the booty taken by the Allied\\r\\ntroops fighting in the Carpathians, and north of the Vistula, is not\\r\\nincluded. This amounts to a further 40,000 prisoners. Przemysl\\r\\nsurrendered to the German\\'s on June 3, 1915, only ten weeks after the\\r\\nRussian capture of the fortress, which had caused such exultation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral von Mackensen continued toward Lemberg, the capital of Galicia.\\r\\nOn June 18th, when the victorious German armies were approaching the\\r\\ngates of Lemberg, the Russian losses were estimated at 400,000 dead and\\r\\nwounded, and 300,000 prisoners, besides 100,000 lost before Marshal von\\r\\nHindenburg\\'s forces in Poland and Courland. On June 23d Lemberg fell.\\r\\nThe weakness of Russia in this campaign arose from the exhaustion of her\\r\\nammunition supplies, but great shipments of such supplies were being\\r\\nconstantly forwarded from Vladivostock.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the German army crossed the San, Wilhelm II, then German Emperor,\\r\\nwas present. It is interesting to look back on the scene. Here is a\\r\\nparagraph from the account of the Wolff Telegraphic Bureau: \"The Emperor\\r\\nhad hurried forward to his troops by automobile. On the way he was\\r\\ngreeted with loud hurrahs by the wounded, riding back in wagons. On the\\r\\nheights of Jaroslav the Emperor met Prince Eitel Friedrich, and then,\\r\\nfrom several points of observation, for hours followed with keen\\r\\nattention the progress of the battle for the crossing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the great offensive in Galicia was well under way, the Germans\\r\\nwere pushing forward in East Prussia. Finding little resistance they\\r\\nultimately invaded Courland, captured Libau, and established themselves\\r\\nfirmly in that province. The sweep of the victorious German armies\\r\\nthrough Galicia was continued into Poland. On July 19th William the War\\r\\nLord bombastically telegraphed his sister, the Queen of Greece, to the\\r\\neffect that he had \"paralyzed Russia for at least six months to come\"\\r\\nand was on the eve of \"delivering a coup on the western front that will\\r\\nmake all Europe tremble.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be futile to recount the details of the various German\\r\\nvictories which followed the advance into Poland. On July 24th, the\\r\\nGerman line ran from Novgorod in the north, south of Przasnysz, thence\\r\\nto Novogeorgievsk, then swinging to the southeast below Warsaw it passed\\r\\nclose to the west of Ivangorad, Lublin, Chelm, and then south to a point\\r\\njust east of Lemberg. Warsaw at that time was in the jaws of the German\\r\\nnutcracker.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 21st, the bells in all the churches throughout Russia clanged a\\r\\ncall to prayer for twenty-four hours\\' continual service of intercession\\r\\nfor victory. In spite of the heat the churches were packed. Hour after\\r\\nhour the people stood wedged together, while the priests and choirs\\r\\nchanted their litanies. Outside the Kamian Cathedral an open-air mass\\r\\nwas celebrated in the presence of an enormous crowd. But the German\\r\\nvictories continued.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 5th Warsaw was abandoned. Up to July 29th hope was entertained\\r\\nin military quarters in London and Paris that the Germans would stand a\\r\\nsiege in their fortresses along the Warsaw salient, but on that date\\r\\nadvices came from Petrograd that in order to save the Russian armies a\\r\\nretreat must be made, and the Warsaw fortresses abandoned. For some time\\r\\nbefore this the Russian resistance had perceptibly stiffened, and many\\r\\nvigorous counter-attacks had been made against the German advance, but\\r\\nit was the same old story, the lack of ammunition. The armies were\\r\\ncompelled to retire and await the munitions necessary for a new\\r\\noffensive.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last days of Russian rule in Warsaw were days of extraordinary\\r\\ninterest. The inhabitants, to the number of nearly half a million,\\r\\nsought refuge in Russia. All goods that could be useful to the Germans\\r\\nwere either removed or burned. Crops were destroyed in the surrounding\\r\\nfields. When the Germans entered they found an empty and deserted city,\\r\\nwith only a few Poles and the lowest classes of Jews still left. Warsaw\\r\\nis a famous city, full of ancient palaces, tastefully, adorned shops,\\r\\nfinely built streets, and fourscore church towers where the bells are\\r\\naccustomed to ring melodiously for matins and vespers. In the Ujazdowske\\r\\nAvenue one comes to the most charming building in all Warsaw, the\\r\\nLazienki Palace, with its delicious gardens mirrored in a lovely lake.\\r\\nIt is a beautiful city.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fall of Warsaw meant the fall of Russian Poland, but Russia was not\\r\\nyet defeated. Von Hindenburg was to be treated as Napoleon was in 1812,\\r\\nThe strategy of the Grand Duke was sound; so long as he could save the\\r\\narmy the victories of Germany would be futile. It is true that the\\r\\nGerman armies were not compelled, like those of Napoleon, to live on the\\r\\nland. They could bring their supplies from Berlin day by day, but every\\r\\nmile they advanced into hostile territory made their task harder. The\\r\\nGerman line of communication, as it grew longer, became weaker and the\\r\\ntroops needed for garrison duty in the captured towns, seriously\\r\\ndiminished the strength of the fighting army, The Russian retreat was\\r\\ngood strategy and it was carried on with extraordinary cleverness.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is unnecessary to describe the events which succeeded the fall of\\r\\nWarsaw in great detail. There was a constant succession of German\\r\\nvictories and Russian defeats, but never one of the Russian armies\\r\\nenveloped or destroyed. Back they went, day after day, always fighting;\\r\\neach great Russian fortress resisted until it saw itself in danger, and\\r\\nthen safely withdrew its troops. Kovno fell and Novogeorgievsk, and\\r\\nIvangorad, then Ossowietz was abandoned, and Brest-Litovsk and Grodno.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 5th the Emperor of Russia signed the following order:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nToday I have taken supreme command of all the forces of the sea and land\\r\\narmies operating in the theater of war. With firm faith in the clemency\\r\\nof God, with unshakable assurance in final victory, we shall fulfil our\\r\\nsacred duty to defend our country to the last. We will not dishonor the\\r\\nRussian land.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grand Duke Nicholas was made Viceroy of the Caucasus, a post which\\r\\ntook him out of the main theater of fighting but gave him a great field\\r\\nfor fresh military activity. He had been bearing a heavy burden, and had\\r\\nshown himself to be a great commander. He had outmaneuvered von\\r\\nHindenberg again and again, and though finally the Russian armies under\\r\\nhis command had been driven back, the retreat itself was a proof of his\\r\\nmilitary ability, not only in its conception, but in the way in which it\\r\\nwas done.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Emperor chose General Alexieff as his Chief of General Staff. He was\\r\\nthe ablest of the great generals who had been leading the Russian army.\\r\\nWith this change in command a new spirit seemed to come over Russia. The\\r\\nGerman advance, however, was not yet completely checked. It was\\r\\napproaching Vilna.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fighting around Vilna was the bitterest in the whole long retreat.\\r\\nOn the 18th of September it fell, but the Russian troops were safely\\r\\nremoved and the Russian resistance had become strong. Munitions were\\r\\npouring into the new Russian army. The news from the battle-front began\\r\\nto show improvement. On September 8th General Brussilov, further in the\\r\\nsouth, had attacked the Germans in front of Tarnopol, and defeated them\\r\\nwith heavy loss. More than seventeen thousand men were captured with\\r\\nmuch artillery. Soon the news came of other advances. Dubno was retaken\\r\\nand Lutsk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe end of September saw the German advance definitely checked. The\\r\\nRussian forces were now extended in a line from Riga on the north, along\\r\\nthe river Dvina, down to Dvinsk. Then turning to the east along the\\r\\nriver, it again turned south and so on down east of the Pripet Marshes,\\r\\nit followed an almost straight line to the southern frontier. Its two\\r\\nstrongest points were Riga, on the Gulf of Riga, which lay under the\\r\\nprotection of the guns of the fleet, and Dvinsk, through which ran the\\r\\ngreat Petrograd Railway line. Against these two points von Hindenburg\\r\\ndirected his attack. And now, for the first time in many months, he met\\r\\nwith complete failure. The German fleet attempted to assist him on the\\r\\nGulf of Riga, but was defeated by the Russian Baltic fleet with heavy\\r\\nlosses. A bombardment turned out a failure and the German armies were\\r\\ncompelled to retire.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map: Riga and Surroundings.]\\r\\n  THE GERMAN ATTACK ON THE ROAD TO PETROGRAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA more serious effort was made against Dvinsk but was equally\\r\\nunsuccessful and the German losses were immense. Again and again the\\r\\nattempt was made to cross the Dvina River, but without success; the\\r\\nGerman invasion was definitely stopped. By the end of October there was\\r\\ncomplete stagnation in the northern sector of the battle line, and\\r\\nthough in November there were a number of battles, nothing happened of\\r\\ngreat importance.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the year 1916 the Russian armies seemed to have had a new birth.\\r\\nAt last they were supplied with guns and munitions. They waited until\\r\\nthey were ready. In March a series of battles was fought in the\\r\\nneighborhood of Lake Narotch, and eight successive attacks were made\\r\\nagainst the German army, intrenched between Lake Narotch and Lake\\r\\nVischenebski. The Germans at first were driven back and badly defeated.\\r\\nLater on, however, the Russian artillery was sent to another section,\\r\\nand the Germans were able to recover their position. During June the\\r\\nRussians attacked all along the southern part of their line. In three\\r\\nweeks they had regained a whole province. Lutsk and Dubno had been\\r\\nretaken; two hundred thousand men and hundreds of guns, had been\\r\\ncaptured, and the Austrian line had been pierced and shattered. Further\\r\\nsouth the German army had been compelled to retreat and the Russian\\r\\narmies were in Bukovina and Galicia. On the 10th of August Stanislau\\r\\nfell.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time two Austrian armies had been shattered, over three hundred\\r\\nand fifty thousand prisoners taken, and nearly a million men put out of\\r\\naction. Germany, however, was sending reinforcements as fast as\\r\\npossible, and putting up a desperate defense. Nevertheless everything\\r\\nwas encouraging for Russia and she entered upon the winter in a very\\r\\ndifferent condition from her condition in the previous year. Then she\\r\\nhad just ended her great retreat. Now she had behind her a series of\\r\\nsuccesses. But a new difficulty had arisen in the loss of the political\\r\\nharmony at home which had marked the first years of the war. Dark days\\r\\nwere ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXII\\r\\n\\r\\nHOW THE BALKANS DECIDED\\r\\n\\r\\n For more than half a century the Balkans have presented a problem which\\r\\n disturbed the minds of the statesmen of Europe. Again and again, during\\r\\n that period, it seemed that in the Balkan mountains might be kindled a\\r\\n blaze which might set the world afire. Balkan politics is a labyrinth\\r\\n in which one might easily be lost. The inhabitants of the Balkans\\r\\n represent many races, each with its own ambition, and, for the most\\r\\n part, military. There were Serbs, and Bulgarians, and Turks, and\\r\\n Roumanians, and Greeks, and their territorial divisions did not\\r\\n correspond to their nationalities. The land was largely mountainous,\\r\\n with great gaps that make it, in a sense, the highway of the world.\\r\\n From 1466 to 1878 the Balkans was in the dominion of the Turks. In the\\r\\n early days while the Turks were warring against Hungary, their armies\\r\\n marched through the Balkan hills. The natives kept apart, and preserved\\r\\n their language, religion and customs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the nineteenth century, as the Turks grew weaker, their subject\\r\\npeople began to seek independence. Greece came first, and, in 1829,\\r\\naided by France, Russia and Great Britain, she became an independent\\r\\nkingdom. Serbia revolted in 1804, and by 1820 was an autonomous state,\\r\\nthough still tributary to Turkey. In 1859, Roumania became autonomous.\\r\\nThe rising of Bulgaria in 1876, however, was really the beginning of the\\r\\nsuccession of events which ultimately led to the World War of 1914-18.\\r\\nThe Bulgarian insurrection was crushed by the Turks in such a way as to\\r\\nstir the indignation of the whole world. What are known as the\\r\\n\"Bulgarian Atrocities\" seem mild today, but they led to the\\r\\nRusso-Turkish War in 1877.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe treaty of Berlin, by which that war was settled in 1878, was one of\\r\\nthose treaties which could only lead to trouble. It deprived Russia of\\r\\nmuch of the benefit of her victory, and left nearly every racial\\r\\nquestion unsettled. Roumania lost Bessarabia, which was mainly inhabited\\r\\nby Roumanians. Bosnia and Herzegovina were handed over to the\\r\\nadministration of Austria. Turkey was allowed to retain Macedonia,\\r\\nAlbania and Thrace. Serbia was given Nish, but had no outlet to the sea.\\r\\nGreece obtained Thessaly, and a new province was made of the country\\r\\nsouth of the Balkans called Eastern Rumelia. From that time on, quarrel\\r\\nafter quarrel made up the history of the Balkan peoples, each of whom\\r\\nsought the assistance and support of some one of the great powers.\\r\\nRussia and Austria were constantly intriguing with the new states, in\\r\\nthe hope of extending their own domains in the direction of\\r\\nConstantinople.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history of Bulgaria shows that that nation has been continually the\\r\\ncenter of these intrigues. In 1879 they elected as their sovereign\\r\\nPrince Alexander of Battenburg, whose career might almost be called\\r\\nromantic. A splendid soldier and an accomplished gentleman, he stands\\r\\nout as an interesting figure in the sordid politics of the Balkans. He\\r\\nidentified himself with his new country. In 1885 he brought about a\\r\\nunion with Eastern Rumelia, which led to a disagreement with Russia.\\r\\n\\r\\nSerbia, doubtless at Russian instigation, suddenly declared war, but was\\r\\noverwhelmed by Prince Alexander in short order. Russia then abducted\\r\\nPrince Alexander, but later was forced to restore him. However, Russian\\r\\nintrigues, and his failure to obtain support from one of the great\\r\\npowers, forced his abdication in 1886.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1887 Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha became the Prince of\\r\\nBulgaria. He, also, was a remarkable man, but not the romantic of his\\r\\npredecessor. He seems to have been a sort of a parody of a king. He was\\r\\nfond of ostentation, and full of ambition. He was a personal coward, but\\r\\nextremely cunning. During his long reign he built up Bulgaria into a\\r\\npowerful, independent kingdom, and even assumed the title of Czar of\\r\\nBulgaria. During the first days of his reign he was kept safely on the\\r\\nthrone by his mother, the Princess Clementine, a daughter of Louis\\r\\nPhillippe, who, according to Gladstone, was the cleverest woman in\\r\\nEurope, and for a few years Bulgaria was at peace. In 1908 he declared\\r\\nBulgaria independent, and its independence was recognized by Turkey on\\r\\nthe payment of an indemnity. During this period Russia was the protector\\r\\nof Bulgaria, but the Bulgarian fox was looking also for the aid of\\r\\nAustria. Serbia more and more relied upon Russia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Painting]\\r\\n  Official Canadian War Records.\\r\\n  \"TIME\\'S UP!

Y.\\r\\n  British Official Photo\\r\\n  THE NERVE-SYSTEM OF THE FIGHTING ARMIES\\r\\n  What the nerves are to the human body the signal system was to the\\r\\n  armies, transmitting warnings of danger from the outposts to a central\\r\\n  brain, and flashing back the thing to be done to meet it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Austrian treatment of the Slavs was a source of constant irritation\\r\\nto Serbia. Roumania had a divided feeling. Her loss of Bessarabia to\\r\\nRussia had caused ill feeling, but in Austria\\'s province of Transylvania\\r\\nthere were millions of Roumanians, whom Roumania desired to bring under\\r\\nher rule. Greece was fearful of Russia, because of Russia\\'s desire for\\r\\nthe control of Constantinople. All of these nations, too, were deeply\\r\\nconscious of the Austro-German ambitions for extension of their power\\r\\nthrough to the East. Each of these principalities was also jealous of\\r\\nthe other. Bulgaria and Serbia had been at war; many Bulgarians were in\\r\\nthe Roumanian territory, many Serbians, Bulgarians and Greeks in\\r\\nMacedonia. There was only one tie in common, that was their hatred of\\r\\nTurkey. In 1912 a league was formed, under the direction of the Greek\\r\\nstatesman, Venizelos, having for its object an attack on Turkey. By\\r\\nsecret treaties arrangements were made for the division of the land,\\r\\nwhich they hoped to obtain from Turkey.\\r\\n\\r\\nWar was declared, and Turkey was decisively defeated, and then the\\r\\ntrouble began. Serbia and Bulgaria had been particularly anxious for an\\r\\noutlet to the sea, and in the treaty between them it had been arranged\\r\\nthat Serbia should have an outlet on the Adriatic, while Bulgaria was to\\r\\nobtain an outlet on the AEgean. The Triple Alliance positively refused\\r\\nSerbia its share of the Adriatic coast. Serbia insisted, therefore, on a\\r\\nrevision of the treaty, which would enable her to have a seaport on the\\r\\nAEgean.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn attempt was made to settle the question by arbitration, but King\\r\\nFerdinand refused, whereupon, in July, 1913, the Second Balkan War\\r\\nbegan. Bulgaria was attacked by Greece and Serbia, and Turkey took a\\r\\nchance and regained Adrianople, and even Roumania, which had been\\r\\nneutral in the First Baltic War, mobilized her armies and marched toward\\r\\nSofia. Bulgaria surrendered, and on the 10th of August the Treaty of\\r\\nBucharest was signed by the Balkan States.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of this Bulgaria was left in a thoroughly dissatisfied state\\r\\nof mind. She had been the leader in the war against Turkey, she had\\r\\nsuffered heavy losses, and she had gained almost nothing. Moreover she\\r\\nhad lost to Roumania, a territory containing a quarter of a million\\r\\nBulgarians, and a splendid harbor on the Black Sea. Serbia and Greece\\r\\nwere the big winners. Such a treaty could not be a final settlement. The\\r\\nBalkans were left seething with unrest. Serbia, though she had gained\\r\\nmuch, was still dissatisfied. Her ambitions, however, now turned in the\\r\\ndirection of the Jugoslavs under the rule of Austria, and it was her\\r\\nagitation in this matter which directly brought on the Great War. But\\r\\nBulgaria was sullen and ready for revenge. When the Great War began,\\r\\ntherefore, Roumania, Serbia, Montenegro and Greece were strongly in\\r\\nsympathy with Russia, who had been their backer and friend. Bulgaria, in\\r\\nspite of all she owed to Russia in the early days, was now ready to find\\r\\nprotection from an alliance with the Central Powers. Her feeling was\\r\\nwell known to the Allies, and every effort was made to obtain her\\r\\nfriendship and, if possible, her aid.\\r\\n\\r\\nViviani, then Premier of France, in an address before the French Chamber of\\r\\nDeputies, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Balkan question was raised at the outset of the war, even before it\\r\\ncame to the attention of the world. The Bucharest Treaty had left in\\r\\nBulgaria profound heartburnings. Neither King nor people were resigned\\r\\nto the loss of the fruits of their efforts and sacrifices, and to the\\r\\nconsequences of the unjustifiable war they had waged upon their former\\r\\nallies. From the first day, the Allied governments took into account the\\r\\ndangers of such a situation, and sought a means to remedy it. Their\\r\\npolicy has proceeded in a spirit of justice and generosity which has\\r\\ncharacterized the attitude of Great Britain, Russia and Italy as well as\\r\\nFrance. We have attempted to re-establish the union of the Baltic\\r\\npeoples, and in accord with them seek the realization of their principal\\r\\nnational aspirations. The equilibrium thus obtained by mutual sacrifices\\r\\nreally made by each would have been the best guarantee of future peace.\\r\\nDespite constant efforts in which Roumania, Greece and Serbia lent their\\r\\nassistance, we have been unable to obtain the sincere collaboration of\\r\\nthe Bulgarian Government. The difficulties respecting the negotiations\\r\\nwere always at Sofia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the beginning of the war it appears, therefore, that Bulgaria was\\r\\nentering into negotiations with the Allies, hoping to regain in this\\r\\nway, some of the territory she had lost in the Second Baltic War. Many\\r\\nof her leading statesmen and most distinguished generals favored the\\r\\ncause of Russia, but in May came the great German advance in Galicia,\\r\\nand the Allies\\' stalemate in the Dardanelles, and the king, and his\\r\\nsupporters, found the way clear for a movement in favor of Germany.\\r\\nStill protesting neutrality they signed a secret treaty with Berlin,\\r\\nVienna and Constantinople on July 17th. The Central Powers had promised\\r\\nthem not only what they had been asking, in Macedonia, but also the\\r\\nGreek territory of Epirus. This treaty was concealed from those\\r\\nBulgarian leaders who still held to Russia, and on the 5th of October\\r\\nBulgaria formally entered into war on the side of Germany, and began an\\r\\nattack on Serbia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe full account of the intrigue which led to this action has never been\\r\\ntold. It is not improbable that King Ferdinand himself never had any\\r\\nother idea than to act as he did, but he dissembled for a long time. He\\r\\nset forth his claims in detail to the Allies, who used every effort to\\r\\ninduce Roumania, Greece and Serbia to make the concessions that would be\\r\\nnecessary. Such concessions were made, but not until it was too late. In\\r\\na telegram from Milan dated September 24th, an account is given of an\\r\\ninterview between Czar Ferdinand and a committee from those Bulgarians\\r\\nwho were opposed to the King\\'s policy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mind your own head. I shall mind mine!\" are the words which the King\\r\\nspoke to M. Stambulivski when he received the five opposition members\\r\\nwho had come to warn him of the danger to which he was exposing himself\\r\\nand the nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe five members were received by the King in the red room at the Royal\\r\\nPalace and chairs had been placed for them around a big table. The King\\r\\nentered the room, accompanied by Prince Boris, the heir apparent, and\\r\\nhis secretary, M. Boocovitch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Be seated, gentlemen,\" said the King, as he sat down himself, as if for\\r\\na very quiet talk. His secretary took a seat at the table, a little\\r\\napart to take notes, but the conversation immediately became so heated\\r\\nand rapid that he was unable to write it down.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first to speak was M. Malinoff, leader of the Democratic party, who\\r\\nsaid: \"The policy adopted by the Government is one of adventure, tending\\r\\nto throw Bulgaria into the arms of Germany, and driving her to attack\\r\\nSerbia. This policy is contrary to the aspirations, feeling and\\r\\ninterests of the country, and if the Government obstinately continues in\\r\\nthis way it will provoke disturbances of the greatest gravity.\" It was\\r\\nthe first allusion to the possibility of a revolution, but the King\\r\\nlistened without flinching. M. Malinoff concluded: \"For these reasons we\\r\\nbeg your Majesty, after having vainly asked the Government, to convoke\\r\\nthe Chamber immediately, and we ask this convocation for the precise\\r\\nobject of saving the country from dangerous adventures by the formation\\r\\nof a coalition Ministry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe King remained silent, and, with a nod, invited M. Stambulivski to\\r\\nspeak. M. Stambulivski was a leader of the Agrarian party, a man of\\r\\nsturdy, rustic appearance, accustomed to speak out his mind boldly, and\\r\\nexceedingly popular among the peasant population. He grew up himself as\\r\\na peasant, and wore the laborer\\'s blouse up till very recently. He stood\\r\\nup and looking the King straight in the face said in resolute tones: \"In\\r\\nthe name of every farmer in Bulgaria I add to what M. Malinoff has just\\r\\nsaid, that the Bulgarian people hold you personally responsible more\\r\\nthan your Government, for the disastrous adventure of 1913. If a similar\\r\\nadventure were to be repeated now its gravity this time would be\\r\\nirreparable. The responsibility would once more fall on your policy,\\r\\nwhich is contrary to the welfare of our country, and the nation would\\r\\nnot hesitate to call you personally to account. That there may be no\\r\\nmistake as to the real wishes of the country I present to your Majesty\\r\\nmy country\\'s demand in writing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe handed the King a letter containing the resolution voted by the\\r\\nAgrarians. The King read it and then turned to M. Zanoff, leader of the\\r\\nRadical Democrats, and asked him to speak. M. Zanoff did so, speaking\\r\\nvery slowly and impressively, and also looking the King straight in the\\r\\nface: \"Sire, I had sworn never again to set foot inside your palace, and\\r\\nif I come today it is because the interests of my country are above\\r\\npersonal questions, and have compelled me. Your Majesty may read what I\\r\\nhave to say in this letter, which I submit to you in behalf of our\\r\\nparty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe handed the letter and the King read it and still remained silent.\\r\\nThen he said, turning to his former Prime Minister and ablest\\r\\npolitician: \"Gueshoff, it is now your turn to speak.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nM. Gueshoff got up and said: \"I also am fully in accord with what M.\\r\\nStambulivski has just said. No matter how severe his words may have been\\r\\nin their simple unpolished frankness, which ignores the ordinary\\r\\nformalities of etiquette, they entirely express our unanimous opinion.\\r\\nWe all, as representing the opposition, consider the present policy of\\r\\nthe Government contrary to the sentiments and interests of the country,\\r\\nbecause by driving it to make common cause with Germany it makes us the\\r\\nenemies of Russia, which was our deliverer, and the adventure into which\\r\\nwe are thus thrown compromises our future. We disapprove most absolutely\\r\\nof such a policy, and we also ask that the Chamber be convoked, and a\\r\\nMinistry formed with the co-operation of all parties.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter M. Gueshoff, the former Premier, M. Daneff also spoke, and\\r\\nassociated himself with what had already been said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe King remained still silent for a while, then he, also, stood up and\\r\\nsaid: \"Gentlemen, I have listened to your threats, and will refer them\\r\\nto the President of the Council of Ministers, that he may know and\\r\\ndecide what to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAll present bowed, and a chilly silence followed. The King had evidently\\r\\ntaken the frank warning given him as a threat to him personally, and he\\r\\nwalked up and down nervously for a while. Prince Boris turned aside to\\r\\ntalk with the Secretary, who had resumed taking notes. The King\\r\\ncontinued pacing to and fro, evidently very nettled. Then, approaching\\r\\nM. Zanoff, and as if to change the conversation, he asked him for news\\r\\nabout this season\\'s harvest.\\r\\n\\r\\nM. Zanoff abruptly replied: \"Your Majesty knows that we have not come\\r\\nhere to talk about the harvest, but of something far more important at\\r\\npresent, namely, the policy of your Government, which is on the point of\\r\\nruining our country. We can on no account approve the policy that is\\r\\nanti-Russian. If the Crown and M. Radoslavoff persist in their policy we\\r\\nshall not answer for the consequences. We have not desired to seek out\\r\\nthose responsible for the disaster of 1913, because other grave events\\r\\nhave been precipitated. But it was a disaster due to criminal folly. It\\r\\nmust not be repeated by an attack on Serbia by Bulgaria, as seems\\r\\ncontemplated by M. Radoslavoff, and which according to all appearances,\\r\\nhas the approval of your Majesty. It would be a premeditated crime, and\\r\\ndeserve to be punished.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe King hesitated a moment, and then held out his hand to M. Zanoff,\\r\\nsaying: \"All right. At all events I thank you for your frankness.\" Then,\\r\\napproaching M. Stambulivski, he repeated to him his question about the\\r\\nharvest.\\r\\n\\r\\nM. Stambulivski, as a simple peasant, at first allowed himself to be led\\r\\ninto a discussion of this secondary matter, and had expressed the hope\\r\\nthat the prohibition on the export of cereals would be removed, when he\\r\\nsuddenly remembered, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But this is not the moment to speak of these things. I again repeat to\\r\\nyour Majesty that the country does not want a policy of adventure which\\r\\ncost it so dear in 1913. It was your own policy too. Before 1913 we\\r\\nthought you were a great diplomatist, but since then we have seen what\\r\\nfruits your diplomacy bears. You took advantage of all the loopholes in\\r\\nthe Constitution to direct the country according to your own views. Your\\r\\nMinisters are nothing. You alone are the author of this policy and you\\r\\nwill have to bear the responsibility.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe King replied frigidly, \"The policy which I have decided to follow is\\r\\nthat which I consider the best for the welfare of the country.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a policy which will only bring misfortune,\" replied the sturdy\\r\\nAgrarian. \"It will lead to fresh catastrophes, and compromise not only\\r\\nthe future of our country, but that of your dynasty, and may cost you\\r\\nyour head.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was as bold a saying as ever was uttered before a King, and Ferdinand\\r\\nlooked astonished at the peasant who was thus speaking to him. He said,\\r\\n\"Do not mind my head; it is already old. Rather mind your own!\" he added\\r\\nwith a disdainful smile, and turned away.\\r\\n\\r\\nM. Stambulivski retorted: \"My head matters little, Sire. What matters\\r\\nmore is the good of our country.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe King paid no more attention to him, and took M. Gueshoff and M.\\r\\nDanoff apart, who again insisted on convoking the Chamber, and assured\\r\\nhim that M. Radoslavoff\\'s government would be in a minority. They also\\r\\nreferred to the Premier\\'s oracular utterances.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" said the King. \"Has Radoslavoff spoken to you, and what has he\\r\\nsaid?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has said--\" replied the leaders, \"that Bulgaria would march with\\r\\nGermany and attack Serbia.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe King made a vague gesture, and then said: \"Oh, I did not know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis incident throws a strong light upon the conflict which was going on\\r\\nin the Balkan states, between those Kings who were of German origin, and\\r\\nwho believed in the German power, and their people who loved Russia.\\r\\nKing Ferdinand got his warning. He did not listen, and he lost his\\r\\nthrone. All this, however, took place before the Bulgarian declaration\\r\\nof war. Yet much had already shown what King Ferdinand was about to do.\\r\\nThe Allies, to be sure, were incredulous, and were doing their best to\\r\\ncultivate the good will of the treacherous King, On September 23rd the\\r\\nofficial order was given for Bulgaria\\'s mobilization. She, however,\\r\\nofficially declared that her position was that of armed neutrality and\\r\\nthat she had no aggressive intentions. As it has developed, she was\\r\\nacting under the direction of the German High Command.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was at this period that Germany had failed to crush Russia in the\\r\\nstruggle on the Vilna, and, in accordance with her usual strategy when\\r\\none plan failed, another was undertaken. It seemed to her, therefore,\\r\\nthat the punishment of Serbia would make up for other failures, and\\r\\nmoreover would enable her to assist Turkey, which needed munitions,\\r\\nbesides releasing for Germany supplies of food and other material which\\r\\nmight come from Turkey. They therefore entrusted an expedition against\\r\\nSerbia to Field Marshal von Mackensen, and had begun to gather an army\\r\\nfor that purpose, north of the Danube.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis army of course was mainly composed of Austrian troops, but was\\r\\nstiffened throughout by some of the best regiments from the German army.\\r\\nTo assist this new army they counted upon Bulgaria, with whom they had\\r\\nalready a secret treaty, and in spite of the falsehoods issued from\\r\\nSofia, the Bulgarian mobilization was meant for an attack on Serbia. The\\r\\ncondition of affairs was well understood in Russia.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 2, 1915, M. Sazonov, Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs,\\r\\nissued the following statement: \"The situation in the Balkans is very\\r\\ngrave. The whole Russian nation is aroused by the unthinkable treachery\\r\\nof Ferdinand and his Government to the Slavic cause. Bulgaria owes her\\r\\nindependence to Russia, and yet seems willing now to become a vassal of\\r\\nRussia\\'s enemies. In her attitude towards Serbia, when Serbia is\\r\\nfighting for her very existence, Bulgaria puts herself in the class with\\r\\nTurkey. We do not believe that the Bulgarian people sympathize with the\\r\\naction of their ruler therefore, the Allies are disposed to give them\\r\\ntime for reflection. If they persist in their present treacherous course\\r\\nthey must answer to Russia.\" The next day the following ultimatum from\\r\\nRussia was handed the Bulgarian Prime Minister:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEvents which are taking place in Bulgaria at this moment give evidence\\r\\nof the definite decision of King Ferdinand\\'s Government to place the\\r\\nfate of its country in the hands of Germany. The presence of German and\\r\\nAustrian officers at the Ministry of War and on the staffs of the army,\\r\\nthe concentration of troops in the zone bordering on Serbia, and the\\r\\nextensive financial support accepted from her enemies by the Sofia\\r\\nCabinet, no longer leave any doubt as to the object of the present\\r\\nmilitary preparations of Bulgaria. The powers of the Entente, who have\\r\\nat heart the realization of the      aspirations of the Bulgarian\\r\\npeople, have on many occasions warned M. Radoslavoff that any hostile\\r\\nact against Serbia would be considered as directed against themselves.\\r\\nThe assurances given by the head of the Bulgarian Cabinet in reply to\\r\\nthese warnings are      contradicted by facts. The representative of\\r\\nRussia, bound to Bulgaria by the imperishable memory of her liberation\\r\\nfrom the Turkish yoke, cannot sanction by his presence preparations for\\r\\nfratricidal aggression against a Slav and allied people. The\\r\\nRussian Minister has, therefore, received orders to leave Bulgaria with\\r\\nall the staffs of the Legation and the Consulates if the Bulgarian\\r\\nGovernment does not within twenty-four hours openly break with the\\r\\nenemies of the Slav cause and of Russia, and does not at once proceed to\\r\\nsend away the officers belonging to the armies of states who are at war\\r\\nwith the powers of the Entente.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilar ultimatums were presented by representatives of France and Great\\r\\nBritain. Bulgaria\\'s reply to these ultimatums was described as bold to\\r\\nthe verge of insolence. In substance she denied that German officers\\r\\nwere on the staffs of Bulgarian armies, but said that if they were\\r\\npresent that fact concerned only Bulgaria, which reserved the right to\\r\\ninvite whomsoever she liked. The Bulgarian Government then issued a\\r\\nmanifesto to the nation, announcing its decision to enter the war on the\\r\\nside of the Central Powers. The manifesto reads as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Central Powers have promised us parts of Serbia, creating an\\r\\nAustro-Hungarian border line, which is absolutely necessary for\\r\\nBulgaria\\'s independence of the Serbians. We do not believe in the\\r\\npromises of the Quadruple Entente. Italy, one of the Allies,\\r\\ntreacherously broke her treaty of thirty-three years. We believe in\\r\\nGermany, which is fighting the whole world to fulfill her treaty with\\r\\nAustria. Bulgaria must fight at the victor\\'s side. The Germans and\\r\\nAustro-Hungarians are victorious on all fronts. Russia soon will have\\r\\ncollapsed entirely. Then will come the turn of France, Italy and Serbia.\\r\\nBulgaria would commit suicide if she did not fight on the side of the\\r\\nCentral Powers, which offer the only possibility of realizing her desire\\r\\nfor a union of all Bulgarian peoples.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manifesto also stated that Russia was fighting for Constantinople\\r\\nand the Dardanelles; Great Britain to destroy Germany\\'s competition;\\r\\nFrance for Alsace and Lorraine, and the other allies to rob foreign\\r\\ncountries; the Central Powers were declared to be fighting to defend\\r\\nproperty and assure peaceful progress. The manifesto filled seven\\r\\ncolumns in the newspapers, and discussed at some length Bulgaria\\'s trade\\r\\ninterests. It attacked Serbia most bitterly, declaring that Serbia had\\r\\noppressed the Bulgarian population of Macedonia in a most barbarous\\r\\nmanner; that she had attacked Bulgarian territory and that the Bulgarian\\r\\ntroops had been forced to fight for the defense of their own soil. In\\r\\nfact it was written in quite the usual German manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nLong before this M. Venizelos, the Greek Premier, had perceived what was\\r\\ncoming. Greece was bound by treaty to assist Serbia if she were attacked\\r\\nby Bulgaria. On September 21st, Venizelos asked France and Britain for a\\r\\nhundred and fifty thousand troops. On the 24th, the Allies agreed to\\r\\nthis and Greece at once began to mobilize. His policy was received with\\r\\ngreat enthusiasm in the Greek Chamber, and former Premier Gounaris, amid\\r\\napplause, expressed his support of the government.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 6th an announcement from Athens stated that Premier Venizelos\\r\\nhad resigned, the King having informed him that he was unable to support\\r\\nthe policy of his Minister. King Constantine was a brother-in-law of the\\r\\nGerman Emperor, and although professing neutrality he had steadily\\r\\nopposed M. Venizelos\\' policy. He had once before forced M. Venizelos\\'\\r\\nresignation, but at the general elections which followed, the Greek\\r\\nstatesman was returned to power by a decisive majority.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntense indignation was caused by the King\\'s action, though the King was\\r\\nable to procure the support of a considerable party. Venizelos\\'\\r\\nresignation was precipitated by the landing of the Allied troops in\\r\\nSaloniki. They had come at the invitation of Venizelos, but the\\r\\nopposition protested against the occupation of Greek territory by\\r\\nforeign troops. After a disorderly session in which Venizelos explained\\r\\nto the Chamber of Deputies the circumstances connected with the landing,\\r\\nthe Chamber passed a vote of confidence in the Government by 142 to 102.\\r\\nThe substance of his argument may be found in his conclusion:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have a treaty with Serbia. If we are honest we will leave nothing\\r\\nundone to insure its fulfillment in letter and spirit. Only if we are\\r\\nrogues may we find excuses to avoid our obligations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map]\\r\\n  TWELVE MILES EAST OF MONASTIR BEGAN THE GREAT ALLIED\\r\\n  OFFENSIVE THAT DEFEATED BULGARIA IN SEPTEMBER, 1918\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon his first resignation M. Zaimis was appointed Premier, and declared\\r\\nfor a policy of armed neutrality. This position was sharply criticised\\r\\nby Venizelos, but for a time became the policy of the Greek Government.\\r\\nMeantime the Allied troops were arriving at Saloniki. On October 3d,\\r\\nseventy thousand French troops arrived. A formal protest was made by the\\r\\nGreek commandant, who then directed the harbor officials to assist in\\r\\narranging the landing. In a short time the Allied forces amounted to a\\r\\nhundred and fifty thousand men, but the German campaign was moving\\r\\nrapidly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German Balkan army captured Belgrade on the 9th of October, and by\\r\\nthat date two Bulgarian armies were on the Serbian frontier. Serbia\\r\\nfound herself opposed by two hundred thousand Austro-Germans and a\\r\\nquarter of a million Bulgarians. Greece and Roumania fully mobilized and\\r\\nwere watching the conflict, and the small allied contingent at Saloniki\\r\\nwas preparing to march inland to the aid of Serbia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conduct of Greece on this occasion has led to universal criticism.\\r\\nThe King himself, no doubt, was mainly moved by his German wife and the\\r\\ninfluence of his Imperial brother-in-law. Those that were associated\\r\\nwith him were probably moved by fear. They had been much impressed by\\r\\nthe strength of the German armies. They had seen the success of the\\r\\ngreat German offensive in Russia, while the French and British were\\r\\nbeing held in the West. They knew, too, the strength of Bulgaria. The\\r\\nnational characteristic of the Greeks is prudence, and it cannot be\\r\\ndenied that there was great reason to suppose that the armies of Greece\\r\\nwould not be able to resist the new attack. With these views Venizelos,\\r\\nthe greatest statesman that Greece had produced for many years, did not\\r\\nagree, and the election seemed to show that he was supported by the\\r\\nmajority of the Greek people.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was another case where the Allies, faced by a dangerous situation,\\r\\nwere acting with too great caution. In Gallipoli they had failed,\\r\\nbecause at the very beginning they had not used their full strength.\\r\\nNow, again, knowing as they did all that depended upon it, bound as they\\r\\nwere to the most loyal support of Serbia, the aid they sent was too\\r\\nsmall to be more than a drop in the bucket. It must be remembered,\\r\\nhowever, that the greatest leaders among the Allies were at all times\\r\\nopposed to in any way scattering their strength. They believed that the\\r\\nwar was to be won in France. Military leaders in particular yielded\\r\\nunder protest to the political leaders when expeditions of this\\r\\ncharacter were undertaken.\\r\\n\\r\\nCertainly this is true, that the world believed that Serbia had a right\\r\\nto Allied assistance. The gallant little nation was fighting for her\\r\\nlife, and public honor demanded that she should be aided. It was this\\r\\nstrong feeling that led to the action that was taken, in spite of the\\r\\nmilitary opinions. It was, however, too late.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second week of October Serbia found herself faced by an enemy\\r\\nwhich was attacking her on three sides. She herself had been greatly\\r\\nweakened. Her losses in 1914, when she had driven Austria from her\\r\\nborder, must have been at least two hundred thousand men. She had\\r\\nsuffered from pestilence and famine. Her strength now could not have\\r\\nbeen more than two hundred thousand, and though she was fairly well\\r\\nsupplied with munitions, she was so much outnumbered that she could\\r\\nhardly hope for success. On her west she was facing the Austro-German\\r\\narmies; on her east Bulgaria; on the south Albania. Her source of\\r\\nsupplies was Saloniki and this was really her only hope. If the Allies\\r\\nat Saloniki could stop the Bulgarian movement, the Serbians might face\\r\\nagain the Austro-Germans. They expected this help from the Allies.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Nish the town was decorated and the school children waited outside\\r\\nthe station with bouquets to present to the coming reinforcements. But\\r\\nthe Allies did not come.\\r\\n\\r\\nVon Mackensen\\'s plan was simple enough. His object was to win a way to\\r\\nConstantinople. This could be done either by the control of the Danube\\r\\nor the Ottoman Railroad. To control the Danube he had to seize\\r\\nnortheastern Serbia for the length of the river. This was comparatively\\r\\neasy and would give him a clear water way to the Bulgarian railways\\r\\nconnected with Constantinople. The Ottoman railway was a harder route to\\r\\nwin. It meant an advance to the southeast, which would clear the Moravo\\r\\nvalley up to Nish, and then the Nishava valley up to Bulgaria. The\\r\\nmovements involved were somewhat complex, but easily carried out on\\r\\naccount of the very great numerical superiority of von Mackensen\\'s\\r\\nforces.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 19th Belgrade was bombarded. The Serbian positions were\\r\\ngradually destroyed. On the 7th of October the German armies crossed the\\r\\nDanube, and on the 8th the Serbians began to retreat. There was great\\r\\ndestruction in Belgrade and the Bulgarian General, Mishitch, was forced\\r\\nslowly back to the foothills of the Tser range.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a time von Mackensen moved slowly. He did not wish to drive the\\r\\nSerbians too far south. On the 12th of October the Bulgarian army began\\r\\nits attack. At first it was held, but by October 17th was pushing\\r\\nforward all along the line. On the 20th they entered Uskub, a central\\r\\npoint of all the routes of southern Serbia. This practically separated\\r\\nthe Allied forces at Saloniki from the Serbian armies further north.\\r\\nDisaster followed disaster. On Tuesday, October 26th, a junction of\\r\\nBulgarian and Austro-German patrols was completed in the Dobravodo\\r\\nmountains. General von Gallwitz announced that a moment of world\\r\\nsignificance had come, that the \"Orient and Occident had been united,\\r\\nand on the basis of this firm and indissoluble union a new and mighty\\r\\nvierbund comes into being, created by the victory of our arms.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map: Proposed railroad through Germany, Austria-Hungary,\\r\\nthe Balkans, Turkey, to Bagdad and the Persian Gulf.]\\r\\n GERMANY\\'S DREAM: \"THE BREMEN-BERLIN-BOSPORUS-BAGDAD-BAHN\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe road from Germany, through Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria to Turkey\\r\\nlay open. On October 31st, Milanovac was lost, and on November 2nd,\\r\\nKraguyevac surrendered, the decisive battle of the war. On November 7th,\\r\\nNish was captured. General Jecoff announced: \"After fierce and\\r\\nsanguinary fighting the fortress of Nish has been conquered by our brave\\r\\nvictorious troops and the Bulgarian flag has been hoisted to remain\\r\\nforever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Serbian army continued steadily to retreat, until on November 8th,\\r\\nadvancing Franco-British troops almost joined with them, presenting a\\r\\nline from Prilep to Dorolovo on the Bulgarian frontier. At this time the\\r\\nBulgarian army suffered a defeat at Izvor, and also at Strumitza. The\\r\\nAllied armies were now reported to number three hundred thousand men.\\r\\nThe Austro-Germans by this time had reached the mountainous region of\\r\\nSerbia, and were meeting with strong resistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 13th, German despatches from the front claimed the capture\\r\\nof 54,000 Serbian prisoners. The aged King Peter of Serbia was in full\\r\\nflight, followed by the Crown Prince. The Serbians, however, were still\\r\\nfighting and on November 15th, made a stand on the western bank of the\\r\\nMorava River, and recaptured the town of Tatova.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this time the Allied world was watching the Serbian struggle with\\r\\ninterest and sympathy. In the House of Lords, Lord Lansdowne in a\\r\\ndiscussion of the English effort to give them aid said: \"It is\\r\\nimpossible to think or speak of Serbia without a tribute to the wondrous\\r\\ngallantry with which that little country withstood two separate\\r\\ninvasions, and has lately been struggling against a third. She repelled\\r\\nthe first two invasions by an effort which I venture to think formed one\\r\\nof the most glorious chapters in the history of this Great War.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSerbia, however, was compelled once more to retreat, and their retreat\\r\\nsoon became a rout. Their guns were abandoned and the roads were strewn\\r\\nwith fainting, starving men. The sufferings of the Serbian people during\\r\\nthis time are indescribable. Men, women, and children struggled along in\\r\\nthe wake of the armies without food or shelter. King Peter himself was\\r\\nable to escape, with the greatest difficulty. By traveling on horseback\\r\\nand mule back in disguise he finally reached Scutari and crossed to\\r\\nBrindisi and finally arrived at Saloniki on New Year\\'s Day, crippled and\\r\\nalmost blind, but still full of fight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe,\" he said, \"in the liberty of Serbia, as I believe in God. It\\r\\nwas the dream of my youth. It was for that I fought throughout manhood.\\r\\nIt has become the faith of the twilight of my life, I live only to see\\r\\nSerbia free. I pray that God may let me live until the day of redemption\\r\\nof my people. On that day I am ready to die, if the Lord wills. I have\\r\\nstruggled a great deal in my life, and am tired, bruised and broken from\\r\\nit, but I will see, I shall see, this triumph. I shall not die before\\r\\nthe victory of my country.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Serbian army had been driven out of Serbia. But the Allies who had\\r\\ncome up from Saloniki were still unbeaten. On October 12th, the French\\r\\nGeneral Serrail arrived and moved with the French forces, as has already\\r\\nbeen said, to the Serbian aid. They met with a number of successes. On\\r\\nOctober 19th they seized the Bulgarian town of Struminitza, and occupied\\r\\nstrong positions on the left bank of the Vardar. On October 27th they\\r\\noccupied Krivolak, with the British Tenth Division, which had joined\\r\\nthem on their right. They then occupied the summit of Karahodjali, which\\r\\ncommanded the whole section of the valley. This the Bulgarians attacked\\r\\nin force on the 5th of November, but were badly repulsed. They then\\r\\nattempted to move toward Babuna Pass, twenty-five miles west of\\r\\nKrivolak, where they hoped to join hands with the Serbian column at that\\r\\npoint.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were being faced by a Bulgarian army numbering one hundred and\\r\\ntwenty-five thousand men, and found themselves in serious danger. They\\r\\nwere compelled to fall back into what is called the \"Entrenched Camp of\\r\\nKavodar\" without bringing the aid to the Serbian army that they had\\r\\nhoped. The Allied expedition to aid Serbia had failed. It was hopeless\\r\\nfrom the start, and, if anything, had injured Serbia by raising false\\r\\nexpectations which had interfered with their plans.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the whole of this disastrous campaign a desperate political\\r\\nstruggle was going on in Greece. On November 3rd, the Zaimis Cabinet\\r\\ntendered its resignation to King Constantine. The trouble was over a\\r\\nbill for extra pay to army officers, but it led to an elaborate\\r\\ndiscussion of the Greek war policy. M. Venizelos made two long speeches\\r\\ndefending his policy, and condemning the policy of his opponents in\\r\\nregard to the Balkan situation. He said that he deplored the fact that\\r\\nSerbia was being left to be crushed by Bulgaria, Greece\\'s hereditary\\r\\nenemy, who would not scruple later to fall on Greece herself. He spoke\\r\\nof the King in a friendly way, criticizing, however, his position. He\\r\\nhad been twice removed from the Premiership, although he had a majority\\r\\nbehind him in the Greek Chamber.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Our State,\" he said, \"is a democracy, presided over by the King, and\\r\\nthe whole responsibility rests with the Cabinet. I admit that the Crown\\r\\nhas a right to disagree with the responsible Government if he thinks the\\r\\nlatter is not in agreement with the national will. But after the recent\\r\\nelection, non-agreement is out of the question, and now the Crown has\\r\\nnot the right to disagree again on the same question. It is not a\\r\\nquestion of patriotism but of constitutional liberty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the vote was taken the Government was defeated by 147 to 114.\\r\\nInstead of appointing Venizelos Premier, King Constantine gave the\\r\\nposition to M. Skouloudis, and then dissolved the Greek Chamber by royal\\r\\ndecree. Premier Skouloudis declared his policy to be neutrality with the\\r\\ncharacter of sincerest benevolence toward the Entente Powers. The\\r\\ngeneral conditions at Athens during this whole time were causing great\\r\\nanxiety in the Allied capitals, and the Allied expedition were in\\r\\ncontinual fear of an attack in the rear in case of reverse. They\\r\\nendeavored to obtain satisfactory assurances on this point, and while\\r\\nassurances were given, during the whole period of King Constantine\\'s\\r\\nreign aggressive action was prevented because of the doubt as to what\\r\\ncourse King Constantine would take.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not till August 27th, 1916, that Roumania cast aside her role of\\r\\nneutral and entered the war with a declaration of hostilities on\\r\\nAustria-Hungary. Great expectations were founded upon the supposedly\\r\\nwell-trained Roumanian army and upon the nation which, because of its\\r\\nalertness and discipline, was known as \"the policeman of Europe.\" The\\r\\nbelief was general in Paris and London that the weight of men and\\r\\nmaterial thrown into the scale by Roumania would bring the to a speedy,\\r\\nvictorious end.\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany, however, was confident. A spy system excelling in its detailed\\r\\nreports anything that had heretofore been attempted, made smooth the\\r\\npath of the German army. Scarcely had the Roumanian army launched a\\r\\ndrive in force into Transylvania on August 30th, when the message spread\\r\\nfrom Bucharest \"von Mackensen is coming. Recall the army. Draft all\\r\\nmales of military age. Prepare for the worst.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the worst fell upon hapless Roumania. A vast force of military\\r\\nengineers moving like a human screen in front of von Mackensen\\'s array,\\r\\nfollowed routes carefully mapped out by German spies during the period\\r\\nof Roumanians neutrality. Military bridges, measured to the inch, had\\r\\nbeen prepared to carry cannon, material and men over streams and\\r\\nravines. Every Roumanian oil well, mine and storehouse had been located\\r\\nand mapped. German scientists had studied Roumanian weather conditions\\r\\nand von Mackensen attacked while the roads were at their best and the\\r\\nweather most favorable. As the Germans swept forward, spies met them\\r\\ngiving them military information of the utmost value. A swarm of\\r\\nairplanes spied out the movements of the Roumanians and no Roumanian\\r\\nairplanes rose to meet them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph]\\r\\n  THE USEFUL ROLE OF THE CARRIER PIGEON AT THE FRONT\\r\\n  No one would think of giving a Distinguished Service Medal to a\\r\\n  pigeon, but some of them performed service under fire that would have\\r\\n  entitled a soldier to it.

This occurred on March 11, 1917, and was\\r\\n  the most notable exploit of General Maude, commander of the British\\r\\n  Mesopotamian expedition until his death by cholera nine months\\r\\n  afterwards.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral von Falkenhayn, co-operating with von Mackensen, smashed his way\\r\\nthrough Vulkan Pass, and cut the main line running to Bucharest at\\r\\nCraiova. The Dobrudja region was over-run and the central Roumanian\\r\\nplain was swept clear of all Roumanian opposition to the German advance.\\r\\nThe seat of government transferred from Bucharest to Jassy on November\\r\\n28, 1916, and on December 6th Bucharest was entered by von Mackensen,\\r\\ndefinitely putting an end to Roumania as a factor in the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result of the fall of Roumania was to release immense stores of\\r\\npetroleum for German use. British and Roumanian engineers had done their\\r\\nutmost by the use of explosives to make useless the great Roumanian oil\\r\\nwells, but German engineers soon had the precious fluid in full flow.\\r\\nThis furnished the fuel which Germany had long and ardently desired. The\\r\\noil-burning submarine now came into its own. It was possible to plan a\\r\\ngreat fleet of submersibles to attempt execution of von Tirpitz\\'s plan\\r\\nfor unrestricted submarine warfare. This was decided upon by the German\\r\\nHigh Command, the day Bucharest fell. It was realized that such a policy\\r\\nwould bring the United States into the war, but the Kaiser and his\\r\\nadvisers hoped the submarine on sea and a great western front offensive\\r\\non land would force a decision in favor of Germany before America could\\r\\nget ready. How that hope failed was revealed at Chateau-Thierry and in\\r\\nthe humiliation of Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CAMPAIGN IN MESOPOTAMIA\\r\\n\\r\\nIn our previous discussion of the British campaign in Mesopotamia we\\r\\nleft the British forces intrenched at Kurna, and also occupying Basra,\\r\\nthe port of Bagdad. The object of the Mesopotamia Expedition was\\r\\nprimarily to keep the enemy from the shores of the Gulf of Persia. If\\r\\nthe English had been satisfied with that, the misfortune which was to\\r\\ncome to them might never have occurred, but the whole expedition was\\r\\nessentially political rather than military in its nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British were defending India. The Germans, unable to attack the\\r\\nBritish Empire by sea, were hoping to attack her by land. They had\\r\\nalready attempted to stir up a Holy War with the full expectation that\\r\\nit would lead to an Indian revolution. In this they had failed, for the\\r\\nmillions of Mohammedans in India cared little for the Turkish Sultan or\\r\\nhis proclamations. Through Bagdad, however, they hoped to strike a blow\\r\\nat the English influence on the Persian Gulf. The English, therefore,\\r\\nfelt strongly that it was not enough to sit safely astride the Tigris,\\r\\nbut that a blow at Bagdad would produce a tremendous political effect.\\r\\nIt would practically prevent German communication with Persia, and the\\r\\nIndian frontier.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a matter of fact the Persian Gulf and the oil fields were safe so\\r\\nlong as the English held Kurna and Basra, and the Arabs were of no\\r\\nspecial consequence. The real reason for the expedition was probably\\r\\nthat about this time matters were moving badly for the Allies. Serbia\\r\\nwas in trouble in the Balkans, Gallipoli was a failure, something it\\r\\nseemed ought to be done to restore the British prestige. Up to this time\\r\\nthe Mesopotamia Expedition had been a great success, but it had made no\\r\\ngreat impression on the world. The little villages in the hands of the\\r\\nBritish had unknown names, but if Bagdad should be captured Great\\r\\nBritain would have something to boast of; something would keep up its\\r\\nprestige among its Mohammedan subjects.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the expedition to Bagdad was determined on, there had been\\r\\nseveral lively fights between the English forces and the Turks. On March\\r\\n3d a Turkish force numbering about twelve thousand appeared at Ahwaz\\r\\nwhere the British had placed a small garrison to protect the pipe line\\r\\nof the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The British retirement led to heavy\\r\\nfighting, with severe losses.\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of lively skirmishes followed, and then the serious attack\\r\\nagainst Shaiba. The Turkish army numbered about eighteen thousand men,\\r\\nof whom eleven thousand were regulars. The fighting lasted for several\\r\\ndays, the Turks being reinforced. On the 14th of April, however, the\\r\\nEnglish attacked in turn and put the whole enemy force to flight. The\\r\\nBritish lost about seven hundred officers and men, reported a Turkish\\r\\nloss of about six thousand. In their retreat the Turks were attacked by\\r\\ntheir Arab allies, and suffered additional losses. From that time till\\r\\nsummer there were no serious contests, although there were occasional\\r\\nskirmishes which turned out favorably to the British.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time the Turks had collected a considerable army north of Kurna,\\r\\nand on May 31st an expedition was made to disperse it. On June 3d the\\r\\nBritish captured Amara, seventy-five miles above Kurna, scattering the\\r\\nTurkish army. Early in July a similar expedition was sent against\\r\\nNasiriyeh, which led to serious fighting, the Turks being badly defeated\\r\\nwith a loss of over two thousand five hundred men.\\r\\n\\r\\nKut-el-Amara still remained, and early in August an expedition was\\r\\ndirected against that point. The Turks were found in great force, well\\r\\nintrenched, and directed by German officers. The battle lasted for four\\r\\ndays. The English suffered great hardship on account of the scarcity of\\r\\nwater and the blinding heat, but on September 29th they drove the enemy\\r\\nfrom the city and took possession. More than two thousand prisoners were\\r\\ntaken. The town was found thoroughly fortified, with an elaborate system\\r\\nof trenches extending for miles, built in the true German fashion. Its\\r\\ncapture was the end of the summer campaign.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British now had at last made up their minds to push on to Bagdad.\\r\\nGeneral Townshend, whose work so far had been admirable, protested, but\\r\\nSir John Nixon, and the Indian military authorities, were strongly in\\r\\nfavor of the expedition. By October, Turkey was able to gather a large\\r\\narmy. She was fighting in Transcaucasia, Egypt, Gallipoli and\\r\\nMesopotamia. Little was going on in the first three of these fronts, and\\r\\nshe was able therefore to send to Mesopotamia almost a quarter of a\\r\\nmillion men.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map: Bagdad in the Northwest corner, Basra in the Southeast\\r\\ncorner.]\\r\\n  THE MESOPOTAMIAN SECTOR, WHERE THE BRITISH ROUTED THE TURKISH ARMY\\r\\n  Kut-el-Amara first besieged and captured by the Turks, was retaken by\\r\\n  General Maude on February 26,1917; Bagdad the Magnificent felt on\\r\\n  March 11th. It was here that General Maude, the hero of Mesopotamia,\\r\\n  died on November 18, 1917.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo meet these, General Townshend had barely fifteen thousand men, of\\r\\nwhom only one-third were white soldiers.  He was backed by a flotilla of\\r\\nboats of almost every kind,--river boats, motor launches, paddle\\r\\nsteamers, native punts. The British army was almost worn out by the\\r\\nfighting during the intense heat of the previous summer. But their\\r\\nsuccess had given them confidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early days of October the advance began. For some days it\\r\\nproceeded with no serious fighting. On the 23d of October it reached\\r\\nAzizie, and was halted by a Turkish force numbering about four thousand.\\r\\nThese were soon routed, and the advance continued until General\\r\\nTownshend arrived at Lajj, about seven miles from Ctesiphon, where the\\r\\nTurks were found heavily intrenched and in great numbers. Ctesiphon was\\r\\na famous old city which had been the battle ground of Romans and\\r\\nParthians, but was now mainly ruins. In these ruins, however, the Turks\\r\\nfound admirable shelter for nests of machine guns. On the 21st of\\r\\nNovember General Townshend made his attack.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map]\\r\\n  Map of Gen. Townshend\\'s Lines of Attack on Kut-El-Amara\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Turks occupied two lines of intrenchments, and had about twenty\\r\\nthousand men, the English about twelve thousand. General Townshend\\'s\\r\\nplan was to divide his army into three columns. The first was to attack\\r\\nthe center of the first Turkish position. A second was directed at the\\r\\nleft of that position, and a third was to swing widely around and come\\r\\nin on the rear of the Turkish force. This plan was entirely successful,\\r\\nbut the Turkish army was not routed, and retreated fighting desperately\\r\\nto its second line. There it was reinforced and counter-attacked with\\r\\nsuch vigor that it drove the British back to its old first trenches. The\\r\\nnext day the Turks were further reinforced and attacked again. The\\r\\nBritish drove them back over and over, but found themselves unable to\\r\\nadvance. The Turks had lost enormously but the English had lost about\\r\\none-third of their strength, and were compelled to fall back. They\\r\\ntherefore returned on the 26th to Lajj, and ultimately, after continual\\r\\nrear guard actions, to Kut. There they found themselves surrounded, and\\r\\nthere was nothing to do but to wait for help.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time the eyes of the world were upon the beleaguered British\\r\\narmy. Help was being hurried to them from India, but Germany also was\\r\\nawake and Marshal von Der Goltz, who had been military instructor in the\\r\\nTurkish army, was sent down to take command of the Turkish forces. The\\r\\ntown of Kut lies in the loop of the Tigris, making it almost an island.\\r\\nThere was an intrenched line across the neck of land on the north, and\\r\\nthe place could resist any ordinary assault. The great difficulty was\\r\\none of supplies. However, as the relieving force was on the way, no\\r\\ngreat anxiety was felt. For some days there was constant bombardment,\\r\\nwhich did no great damage. On the 23d an attempt was made to carry the\\r\\nplace by assault, but this too failed. The relieving force, however, was\\r\\nhaving its troubles. These were the days of floods, and progress was\\r\\nslow and at times almost impossible. Moreover, the Turks were constantly\\r\\nresisting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe relief expedition was composed of thirty thousand Indian troops, two\\r\\nAnglo-Indian divisions, and the remnants of Townshend\\'s expedition, a\\r\\ntotal of about ninety thousand men. General Sir Percy Lake was in\\r\\ncommand of the entire force. The march began on January 6th. By January\\r\\n8th the British had reached Sheikh Saad, where the Turks were defeated\\r\\nin two pitched battles. On January 22d he had arrived at Umm-el-Hanna,\\r\\nwhere the Turks had intrenched themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter artillery bombardment the Turkish positions were attacked, but\\r\\nheavy rains had converted the ground into a sea of mud, rendering rapid\\r\\nmovement impossible. The enemy\\'s fire was heavy and effective,\\r\\ninflicting severe losses, and though every effort was made, the assault\\r\\nfailed.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor weeks the British troops bivouacked in driving rain on soaked and\\r\\nsodden ground. Three times they were called upon to advance over a\\r\\nperfectly flat country, deep in mud, and absolutely devoid of cover\\r\\nagainst well-constructed and well-planned trenches, manned by a brave\\r\\nand stubborn enemy, approximately their equal in numbers. They showed a\\r\\nspirit of endurance and self-sacrifice of which their country may well\\r\\nbe proud.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the repulse at Hanna did not discourage the British army. It was\\r\\ndecided to move up the left bank of the Tigris and attack the Turkish\\r\\nposition at the Dujailah redoubt. This meant a night march across the\\r\\ndesert with great danger that there would be no water supply and that,\\r\\nunless the enemy was routed, the army would be in great danger.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Lake says: \"On the afternoon of March 7th, General Aylmer\\r\\nassembled his subordinate commanders and gave his final instructions,\\r\\nlaying particular stress on the fact that the operation was designed to\\r\\neffect a surprise, and that to prevent the enemy forestalling us, it was\\r\\nessential that the first phase of the operation should be pushed through\\r\\nwith the utmost vigor. His dispositions were, briefly, as follows: The\\r\\ngreater part of a division under General Younghusband, assisted by naval\\r\\ngunboats, controlled the enemy on the left bank. The remaining troops\\r\\nwere formed into two columns, under General Kemball and General Keary\\r\\nrespectively, a reserve of infantry, and the cavalry brigade, being held\\r\\nat the Corps Commander\\'s own disposal. Kemball\\'s column covered on the\\r\\nouter flank by the cavalry brigade was to make a turning movement to\\r\\nattack the Dujailah redoubt from the south, supported by the remainder\\r\\nof the force, operating from a position to the east of the redoubt. The\\r\\nnight march by this large force, which led across the enemy\\'s front to a\\r\\nposition on his right flank, was a difficult operation, entailing\\r\\nmovement over unknown ground, and requiring most careful arrangement to\\r\\nattain success.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks to excellent staff work and good march discipline the troops\\r\\nreached their allotted position apparently undiscovered by the enemy,\\r\\nbut while Keary\\'s column was in position at daybreak, ready to support\\r\\nKemball\\'s attack, the latter\\'s command did not reach the point selected\\r\\nfor its deployment in the Dujailah depression until more than an hour\\r\\nlater. This delay was highly prejudicial to the success of the\\r\\noperation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen, nearly three hours later, Kemball\\'s troops advanced to the attack,\\r\\nthey were strongly opposed by the enemy from trenches cleverly concealed\\r\\nin the brushwood, and were unable to make further ground for some time,\\r\\nthough assisted by Keary\\'s attack upon the redoubt from the east. The\\r\\nsouthern attack was now reinforced, and by 1 P.M. had pushed forward to\\r\\nwithin five hundred yards of the redoubt, but concealed trenches again\\r\\nstopped further progress and the Turks made several counter-attacks with\\r\\nreinforcements which had by now arrived from the direction of Magasis.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was about this time that the Corps Commander received from his\\r\\nengineer officers the unwelcome news that the water supply contained in\\r\\nrain-water pools and in Dujailah depression, upon which he had reckoned,\\r\\nwas insufficient and could not be increased by digging. It was clear,\\r\\ntherefore, that unless the Dujailah redoubt could be carried that day\\r\\nthe scarcity of water would, of itself, compel the troops to fall back.\\r\\nPreparations were accordingly made for a further assault on the redoubt,\\r\\nand attacks were launched from the south and east under cover of a heavy\\r\\nbombardment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attacking forces succeeded in gaining a foothold in the redoubt. But\\r\\nhere they were heavily counter-attacked by large enemy reinforcements,\\r\\nand being subjected to an extremely rapid and accurate shrapnel fire\\r\\nfrom concealed guns in the vicinity of Sinn After, they were forced to\\r\\nfall back to the position from which they started. The troops who had\\r\\nbeen under arms for some thirty hours, including a long night march,\\r\\nwere now much exhausted, and General Aylmer considered that a renewal of\\r\\nthe assault during the night could not be made with any prospect of\\r\\nsuccess. Next morning the enemy\\'s position was found to be unchanged and\\r\\nGeneral Aylmer, finding himself faced with the deficiency of order\\r\\nalready referred to, decided upon the immediate withdrawal of his troops\\r\\nto Wadi, which was reached the same night.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the next month the English were held in their positions by the\\r\\nTigris floods. On April 4th the floods had sufficiently receded to\\r\\npermit of another attack upon Umm-el-Hanna, which this time was\\r\\nsuccessful. On April 8th the Turkish position at Sanna-i-yat was\\r\\nattacked, but the English were repulsed. They then determined to make\\r\\nanother attempt to capture the Sinn After redoubt. On April 17th the\\r\\nfort of Beit-Aiessa, four miles from Es Sinn, on the left bank, was\\r\\ncaptured after heavy bombardment, and held against serious\\r\\ncounter-attacks. On the 20th and 21st the Sanna-i-yat position was\\r\\nbombarded and a vigorous assault was made, which met with some success.\\r\\nThe Turks, however, delivered a strong counter-attack, and succeeded in\\r\\nforcing the British troops back.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Lake says: \"Persistent and repeated attempts on both banks have\\r\\nthus failed, and it was known that at the outside not more than six\\r\\ndays\\' supplies remained to the Kut garrison. The British troops were\\r\\nnearly worn out. The same troops had advanced time and again to assault\\r\\npositions strong by art and held by a determined enemy. For eighteen\\r\\nconsecutive days they had done all that men could do to overcome, not\\r\\nonly the enemy, but also exceptional climatic and physical obstacles,\\r\\nand this on a scale of rations which was far from being sufficient in\\r\\nview of the exertions they had undergone but which the shortage of river\\r\\ntransports, had made it impossible to augment. The need for rest was\\r\\nimperative.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 28th the British garrison at Kut-el-Amara surrendered\\r\\nunconditionally, after a heroic resistance of a hundred and forty-three\\r\\ndays. According to British figures the surrendered army was composed of\\r\\n2,970 English and 6,000 Indian troops. The Turkish figures are 13,300.\\r\\nThe Turks also captured a large amount of booty, although General\\r\\nTownshend destroyed most of his guns and munitions.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the period in which Kut-el-Amara was besieged by the Turks, the\\r\\nBritish troops had suffered much. The enemy bombarded the town almost\\r\\nevery day, but did little damage. The real foe was starvation. At first\\r\\nthe British were confident that a relief expedition would soon reach\\r\\nthem, and they amused themselves by cricket and hockey and fishing in\\r\\nthe river. By early February, however, it was found necessary to reduce\\r\\nthe rations, and a month later they were suffering from hunger. Some\\r\\nlittle help was given them by airplanes, which brought tobacco and some\\r\\nsmall quantities of supplies. Soon the horses and the mules were\\r\\nslaughtered and eaten. As time went on the situation grew desperate;\\r\\ntill almost the end, however, they did not lose hope. Through the\\r\\nwireless they were informed about the progress of the relief expeditions\\r\\nand had even heard their guns in the distance. They gradually grew,\\r\\nhowever, weaker and weaker, so that on the surrender the troops in the\\r\\nfirst lines were too weak to march back with their kits.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Turks treated the prisoners in a chivalric manner; food and tobacco\\r\\nwas at once distributed, and all were interned in Anatolia, except\\r\\nGeneral Townshend and his staff, who were taken to Constantinople. Later\\r\\non it was General Townshend who was to have the honor of carrying the\\r\\nTurkish plea for an armistice in the closing days of the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surrender of Kut created a world-wide sensation. The loss of eight\\r\\nthousand troops was, of course, not a serious matter, and the road to\\r\\nIndia was still barred, but the moral effect was most unfortunate. That\\r\\nthe great British nation, whose power had been so respected in the\\r\\nOrient, should now be forced to yield, was a great blow to its prestige.\\r\\nIn England, of course, there was a flood of criticism. It was very plain\\r\\nthat a mistake had been made. A commission was appointed to inquire into\\r\\nthe whole business. This committee reported to Parliament on June 26,\\r\\n1917, and the report created a great sensation. The substance of the\\r\\nreport was, that while the expedition was justifiable from a political\\r\\npoint of view, it was undertaken with insufficient forces and inadequate\\r\\npreparation, and it sharply criticized those that were responsible.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems plain that the military authorities in India under-estimated\\r\\ntheir opponent. The report especially criticized General Sir John Eccles\\r\\nNixon, the former commander of the British forces in Mesopotamia, who\\r\\nhad urged the expedition, in spite of the objection of General\\r\\nTownshend. Others sharing the blame were the Viceroy of India, Baron\\r\\nHardinge, General Sir Beauchamp Duff, Commander-in-Chief of the British\\r\\nforces in India, and, in England, Major-General Sir Edmund Barrow,\\r\\nMilitary Secretary of the India office, J. Austen Chamberlain, Secretary\\r\\nfor India, and the War Committee of the Cabinet. According to the\\r\\nreport, beside the losses incurred by the surrender more than\\r\\ntwenty-three thousand men were lost in the relieving expedition. The\\r\\ngeneral armament and equipment were declared to be not only\\r\\ninsufficient, but not up to the standard.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn consequence of this report Mr. Chamberlain resigned as secretary for\\r\\nIndia. In the House of Commons, Mr. Balfour, Secretary of Foreign\\r\\nAffairs, supported Lord Hardinge, who, at the time of the report, was\\r\\nUnder Secretary of Foreign Affairs. He declared the criticism of Baron\\r\\nHardinge to be grossly unjust. After some discussion the House of\\r\\nCommons supported Mr. Balfour\\'s refusal to accept Baron Hardinge\\'s\\r\\nresignation, by a vote of 176 to 81. It seems to be agreed that the\\r\\ncivil administration of India were not responsible for the blunders of\\r\\nthe expedition. Ten years before, Lord Kitchener, after a bitter\\r\\ncontroversy with Lord Curzon, had made the military side of the Indian\\r\\nGovernment free of all civilian criticism and control. The blunders here\\r\\nwere military blunders.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe English, of course, were not satisfied to leave the situation in\\r\\nsuch a condition, and at once began their plans for a new attempt to\\r\\ncapture Bagdad. The summer campaign, however, was uneventful, though on\\r\\nMay 18th a band of Cossacks from the Russian armies in Persia joined the\\r\\nBritish camp. A few days afterwards the British army went up the Tigris\\r\\nand captured the Dujailah redoubt, where they had been so badly defeated\\r\\non the 8th of March. They then approached close to Kut, but the weather\\r\\nwas unsuitable, and there was now no object in capturing the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August Sir Percy Lake was succeeded by Lieutenant-General Sir\\r\\nFrederick Stanley Maude, who carefully and thoroughly proceeded to\\r\\nprepare for an expedition which should capture Bagdad. A dispatch from\\r\\nGeneral Maude dated July 10, 1917, gives a full account of this\\r\\nexpedition. It was thoroughly successful. This time with a sufficient\\r\\narmy and a thorough equipment the British found no difficulties, and on\\r\\nFebruary 26th they captured Kut-el-Amara, not after a hard-fought\\r\\nbattle, but as the result of a successful series of small engagements.\\r\\nThe Turks kept up a steady resistance, but the British blood was up.\\r\\nThey were remembering General Townshend\\'s surrender, and the Turks were\\r\\ndriven before them in great confusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe capture of Kut, however, was not an object in itself, and the\\r\\nBritish pushed steadily on up the Tigris. The Turks occasionally made a\\r\\nstand, but without effect. On the 28th of February the English had\\r\\narrived at Azizie, half way to Bagdad, where a halt was made. On the 5th\\r\\nof March the advance was renewed. The Ctesiphon position, which had\\r\\ndefied General Townshend, was found to be strongly intrenched, but\\r\\nempty. On March 7th the enemy made a stand on the River Diala, which\\r\\nenters the Tigris eight miles below Bagdad. Some lively fighting\\r\\nfollowed, the enemy resisting four attempts to cross the Diala. However,\\r\\non March 10th the British forces crossed, and were now close to Bagdad.\\r\\nThe enemy suddenly retired and the British troops found that their main\\r\\nopponent was a dust storm. The enemy retired beyond Bagdad, and on March\\r\\n11th the city was occupied by the English.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fall of Bagdad was an important event. It cheered the Allies, and\\r\\nproved, especially to the Oriental world, the power of the British army.\\r\\nThose who originally planned its capture had been right, but those who\\r\\nwere to carry out the plan had not done their duty. Under General Maude\\r\\nit was a comparatively simple operation, though full of admirable\\r\\ndetails, and it produced all the good effects expected. The British, of\\r\\ncourse, did not stop at Bagdad. The city itself is not of strategic\\r\\nimportance. The surrounding towns were occupied and an endeavor was made\\r\\nto conciliate the inhabitants. The real object of the expedition was\\r\\nattained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXV\\r\\n\\r\\nCANADA\\'S PART IN THE GREAT WAR\\r\\n\\r\\nBy COL. GEO. G. NASMITH, C. M. G., TORONTO\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen, in August,1914, war burst suddenly upon a peaceful world like\\r\\ndistant thunder in a cloudless summer sky, Canada, like the rest of the\\r\\nBritish Empire, was profoundly startled. She had been a peace-loving,\\r\\nnon-military nation, satisfied to develop her great natural resources,\\r\\nand live in harmony with her neighbors; taking little interest in\\r\\nEuropean affairs, Canadians, in fact, were a typical colonial people,\\r\\nwith little knowledge even of the strength of the ties that linked them\\r\\nto the British Empire.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon declaration of war by Great Britain Canada immediately sprang to\\r\\narms. The love of country and empire which had been no obvious thing\\r\\nburst forth in a patriotic fervor as deep as it was spontaneous and\\r\\ngenuine. The call to action was answered with an enthusiasm the like of\\r\\nwhich had rarely, if ever, been seen in any British colony.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Canadian Government called for 20,000 volunteers--enough for a\\r\\nsingle division--as Canada\\'s contribution to the British army. In less\\r\\nthan a month 40,000 men had volunteered, and the Minister of Militia was\\r\\ncompelled to stop the further enrolment of recruits. From the gold\\r\\nfields of the Yukon, from the slopes of the Rockies on the west to the\\r\\nsurf-beaten shores of the Atlantic on the east; from workshop and mine;\\r\\nfrom farm, office and forest, Canada\\'s sons trooped to the colors.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will be the everlasting glory of the men of the first Canadian\\r\\ncontingent, that they needed no spur, either of victory or defeat: they\\r\\nvolunteered because they were quick to perceive that the existence of\\r\\ntheir Empire was threatened by the action of the most formidable\\r\\nnation-in-arms that the world had ever seen. They had been stirred by\\r\\nthe deepest emotion of a race--the love of country.\\r\\n\\r\\nA site for a concentration camp was chosen at Valcartier, nestling among\\r\\nthe blue Laurentian hills, sixteen miles from Quebec, and convenient to\\r\\nthat point of embarkation. Within four days 6,000 men had arrived at\\r\\nValcartier; in another week there were 25,000 men. From centers all over\\r\\nCanada troop trains, each carrying hundreds of embryo soldiers, sped\\r\\ntowards Valcartier and deposited their burdens on the miles of sidings\\r\\nthat had sprung up as though by magic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rapid evolution of that wild and wooded river valley into a model\\r\\nmilitary camp was a great tribute to the engineering skill and energy of\\r\\ncivilians who had never done the like before. One day an army of woodmen\\r\\nwere seen felling trees; the next day the stumps were torn out and the\\r\\nhollows filled; on the third day long rows of tents in regular camp\\r\\nformation covered the ground, and on the fourth day they were occupied\\r\\nby civilian soldiers concentrated upon learning the rudiments of the art\\r\\nand science of war.\\r\\n\\r\\nStreets were laid out; miles of water pipes, sunk in machine-made\\r\\nditches, were connected to hundreds of taps and shower baths; electric\\r\\nlight was installed; three miles of rifle butts completed, and in two\\r\\nweeks the camp was practically finished--the finest camp that the first\\r\\nCanadians were destined to see. The building of Valcartier camp was\\r\\ncharacteristic of the driving power, vision and genius of the Minister\\r\\nof Militia, General Sir Sam Hughes.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the 33,000 men assembled at Valcartier, the great majority were\\r\\ncivilians without any previous training in warfare. About 7,000\\r\\nCanadians had taken part in the South African war, fifteen years before,\\r\\nand some of these, together with a few ex-regulars who had seen active\\r\\nservice, were formed into the Princess Patricia\\'s Light Infantry.\\r\\nOtherwise, with the exception of the 3,000 regulars that formed the\\r\\nstanding army of Canada, the men and most of the officers were amateurs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was therefore a feat that the Canadian people could well afford to be\\r\\nproud of, that in the great crisis they were able, through their\\r\\naggressive Minister of Militia, not only to gather up these forces so\\r\\nquickly but that they willingly and without delay converted their\\r\\nindustries to the manufacture of all necessary army equipment. Factories\\r\\nall over the country immediately began turning out vast quantities of\\r\\nkhaki cloth, uniforms, boots, ammunition, harness, wagons, and the\\r\\nthousand and one articles necessary for an army.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the end of September, 1914, the Canadian Expeditionary Force had\\r\\nbeen roughly hewn into shape, battalions had been regrouped and\\r\\nremodeled, officers transferred and re-transferred, intensive training\\r\\ncarried on, and all the necessary equipment assembled. On October 3,\\r\\n1914, thirty-three Atlantic liners, carrying the contingent of 33,000\\r\\nmen, comprising infantry, artillery, cavalry, engineers, signalers,\\r\\nmedical corps, army service supply and ammunition columns, together with\\r\\nhorses, guns, ammunition, wagons, motor lorries and other essentials,\\r\\nsailed from Gaspe basin on the Quebec seaboard to the battle-field of\\r\\nEurope.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was probably the largest convoy that had ever been gathered together.\\r\\nThis modern armada in three long lines, each line one and one-half miles\\r\\napart, led by cruisers and with battleships on the front, rear and\\r\\neither flank, presented a thrilling spectacle. The voyage proved\\r\\nuneventful, and on October 14th, the convoy steamed into Plymouth,\\r\\nreceiving an extraordinary ovation by the sober English people, who\\r\\nseemed temporarily to have gone wild with enthusiasm. Back of that\\r\\ndemonstration was the conviction that blood had proved thicker than\\r\\nwater and that the apparently flimsy ties that bound the colonies to the\\r\\nempire were bonds that were unbreakable. The German conviction that the\\r\\nBritish colonies would fall away and the British Empire disintegrate\\r\\nupon the outbreak of a great war had proved fallacious. It was,\\r\\nmoreover, a great demonstration of how the much-vaunted German navy had\\r\\nalready been swept from the seas and rendered impotent by the might of\\r\\nBritain\\'s fleet.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few days later the Canadians had settled down on Salisbury Plain in\\r\\nsouthern England for the further course of training necessary before\\r\\nproceeding to France. There, for nearly four months in the cold and the\\r\\nwet, in the fog and mud, in crowded, dripping tents and under constantly\\r\\ndripping skies, they carried on and early gave evidence of their powers\\r\\nof endurance and unquenchable spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Roberts made his last public appearance before this division and\\r\\naddressing the men said in part: \"Three months ago we found ourselves\\r\\ninvolved in this war--a war not of our own seeking, but one which those\\r\\nwho have studied Germany\\'s literature and Germany\\'s aspirations, knew\\r\\nwas a war which we should inevitably have to deal with sooner or later.\\r\\nThe prompt resolve of Canada to give us such valuable assistance has\\r\\ntouched us deeply. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are fighting a nation which looks upon the British Empire as a\\r\\nbarrier to her development, and has in consequence, long contemplated\\r\\nour overthrow and humiliation. To attain that end she has manufactured a\\r\\nmagnificent fighting machine, and is straining every nerve to gain\\r\\nvictory.... It is only by the most determined efforts that we can defeat\\r\\nher.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this superb German military organization, created by years of\\r\\ntireless effort, was that which Canadian civilians had volunteered to\\r\\nfight. Was it any wonder that some of the most able leaders doubted\\r\\nwhether men and officers, no matter how brave and intelligent, could\\r\\never equal the inspired barbarians who, even at that very moment, were\\r\\nbattling with the finest British and French regulars and pressing them\\r\\nsteadily towards Paris?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a short chapter of this kind attempting to deal with Canada\\'s effort\\r\\nin the great war it is obviously impossible to go into detail or give\\r\\nmore than the briefest of historical pictures. Consequently much that is\\r\\nfascinating can be given but a passing glance: for greater detail larger\\r\\nworks must be consulted. Nevertheless it is well to try and view in\\r\\nperspective events as they occurred, in order to obtain some idea of\\r\\ntheir relative importance.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February, 1915, the first Canadian division crossed the Channel to\\r\\nFrance, and began to obtain front-line experiences in a section of the\\r\\nline just north of Neuve Chapelle.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the first division had been going through its course of training\\r\\nin England a second division had been raised in Canada and arrived in\\r\\nEngland shortly after the first left it.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring that period the conflict in Europe had passed through certain\\r\\npreliminary phases--most of them fortunate for the Allies. The\\r\\nunexpected holding up of the German armies by the Belgians had prevented\\r\\nthe enemy from gaining the channel ports of Calais and Boulogne in the\\r\\nfirst rush. Later on the battle of the Marne had resulted in the rolling\\r\\nback of the German waves until they had subsided on a line roughly drawn\\r\\nthrough Dixmude, Ypres, Armentieres, La Bassee, Lens, and southward to\\r\\nthe French border and the trench phase of warfare had begun.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph]\\r\\n  ON VIMY RIDGE, WHERE CANADA WON LAURELS\\r\\n  The Canadians took the important position of Vimy Ridge on Easter\\r\\n  Monday, April 9, 1917. They advanced with brilliance, having taken the\\r\\n  whole system of German front-line trenches between dawn and 6.30 A.\\r\\n  M. This shows squads of machine gunners operating from shell-craters\\r\\n  in support of the infantry on the plateau above the ridge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph]\\r\\n  Photo from Western Newspaper Union\\r\\n  GENERAL SIR ARTHUR CURRIE\\r\\n  Commander of the Canadian forces on the Western Front.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British held the section of front between Ypres and La-Bassee, about\\r\\nthirty miles in length, the Germans, unfortunately, occupying all the\\r\\nhigher grounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly after the arrival of the Canadian division the British,\\r\\nconcentrating the largest number of guns that had hitherto been gathered\\r\\ntogether on the French front, made an attack on the Germans at Neuve\\r\\nChapelle. This attack, only partially successful in gains of terrain,\\r\\nserved to teach both belligerents several lessons. It showed the British\\r\\nthe need for huge quantities of high explosives with which to blast away\\r\\nwire and trenches and, that in an attack, rifle fire, no matter how\\r\\naccurate, was no match for unlimited numbers of machine guns.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt showed the enemy what could be done with concentrated artillery\\r\\nfire--a lesson that he availed himself of with deadly effect a few weeks\\r\\nlater.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Canadian artillery took part in that bombardment the infantry was\\r\\nnot engaged in the battle of Neuve Chapelle; it received its baptism of\\r\\nfire, however, under excellent conditions, and after a month\\'s\\r\\nexperience in trench warfare was taken out of the line for rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe division was at the time under the command of a British general and\\r\\nthe staff included several highly trained British staff officers.\\r\\nNevertheless the commands were practically all in the hands of\\r\\nCanadians--lawyers, business men, real-estate agents, newspapermen and\\r\\nother amateur soldiers, who, in civilian life as militiamen, had spent\\r\\nmore or less time in the study of the theory of warfare. This should\\r\\nalways be kept in mind in view of subsequent events, as well as the fact\\r\\nthat these amateur soldiers were faced by armies whose officers and\\r\\nmen--professionals in the art and science of warfare--regarded\\r\\nthemselves as invincible.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn mid-April the Canadians took over a sector some five thousand yards\\r\\nlong in the Ypres salient. On the left they joined up with French\\r\\ncolonial troops, and on their right with the British. Thus there were\\r\\nCanadian and French colonial troops side by side.\\r\\n\\r\\nToward the end of April the Germans reverted to supreme barbarism and\\r\\nused poison gas. Undismayed, though suffering terrible losses, the\\r\\nheroic Canadians fought the second battle of Ypres and held the line in\\r\\nthe face of the most terrific assaults.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the news of the second battle of Ypres reached Canada her people\\r\\nwere profoundly stirred. The blight of war had at last fallen heavily,\\r\\ndestroying her first-born, but sorrow was mixed with pride and\\r\\nexaltation that Canadian men had proved a match for the most\\r\\nscientifically trained troops in Europe. As fighters Canadians had at\\r\\nonce leaped into front rank. British, Scotch and Irish blood, with\\r\\nBritish traditions, had proved greater forces than the scientific\\r\\ntraining and philosophic principles of the Huns. It was a glorious\\r\\nillustration of the axiom \"right is greater than might,\" which the\\r\\nGerman had in his pride reversed to read \"might is right.\" It was\\r\\nprophetic of what the final issue of a contest based on such divergent\\r\\nprinciples was to be. So in those days Canadian men and women held their\\r\\nheads higher and carried on their war work with increased determination,\\r\\nstimulated by the knowledge that they were contending with an enemy more\\r\\nremorseless and implacable than those terrible creatures which used to\\r\\ncome to them in their childish dreams. It was felt that, a nation which\\r\\ncould scientifically and in cold blood resort to poison gases--contrary\\r\\nto all accepted agreements of civilized countries--to gain its object\\r\\nmust be fought with all the determination, resources and skill which it\\r\\nwas possible to employ.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada\\'s heart had been steeled. She was now in the war with her last\\r\\ndollar and her last man if need be. She had begun to realize that\\r\\nfailure in Europe would simply transfer the struggle with the German\\r\\nfighting hordes to our Atlantic provinces and the eastern American\\r\\nstates.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe famous Princess Patricia\\'s Canadian Light Infantry was originally\\r\\ncomposed of soldiers who had actually seen service and were therefore\\r\\nveterans. Incidentally they were older men and most of them were married\\r\\nbut the call of the Empire was insistent.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the winter of 1914-15 the British line in Flanders was very thin and\\r\\nthe P. P. C. L. I\\'s. being a trained regiment was sent over to France\\r\\nseveral weeks before the first Canadian division. It soon earned the\\r\\nname of a regiment of extraordinarily hard-fighting qualities and was\\r\\nall but wiped out before spring arrived. The immortal story of this\\r\\ngallant unit must be read in detail if one wishes to obtain any clear\\r\\nconception of their deeds of valor--of what it is possible for man to go\\r\\nthrough and live. However, it was but one regiment whose exploits were\\r\\nlater equaled by other Canadian regiments and it would therefore be\\r\\ninvidious to select anyone for special praise. After operating as a\\r\\nseparate regiment for nearly two years and having been recruited from\\r\\nthe regular Canadian depots in England, it became in composition like\\r\\nother Canadian regiments and was finally incorporated in the third\\r\\nCanadian division.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the spring of 1915, a Canadian cavalry brigade was formed in France\\r\\nmade up of Strathcona\\'s Horse, King Edward\\'s Horse, the Royal Canadian\\r\\nDragoons and Canadian Mounted Rifles.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the second battle of Ypres, the Canadians after resting and\\r\\nre-organization, were moved to a section of the line near LaBassee. Here\\r\\nthey fought the battle of Festubert--a series of infantry attacks and\\r\\nartillery bombardments, which gained little ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly afterwards they fought the battle of Givenchy, equally futile,\\r\\nas far as material results were concerned. Both of these battles had the\\r\\ndouble object of feeling out the strength of the German line and of\\r\\nobtaining the Aubers Ridge, should the attacks prove successful. In both\\r\\nbattles the Canadians showed great aptitude for attack, and tenacity in\\r\\ntheir hold of captured trenches. They also learned the difficult lesson\\r\\nthat if an objective is passed by the infantry the latter enter the zone\\r\\nof their own artillery fire and suffer accordingly.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September, 1915, the Second Canadian Division arrived in Flanders and\\r\\ntook its place at the side of the First Canadian Division, then\\r\\noccupying the Ploegsteert section in front of the Messines-Wytschaete\\r\\nRidge. The rest of the winter was spent more or less quietly by both\\r\\ndivisions in the usual trench warfare, and battling with mud, water and\\r\\nweather.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was here that the Canadians evolved the \"trench raid,\" a method of\\r\\ncutting off a section of enemy trench, killing or taking prisoners all\\r\\nthe enemy inhabitants, destroying it and returning with little or no\\r\\nloss to the attacking party. This method was quickly copied from one end\\r\\nof the Franco-British line to the other; it proved a most valuable\\r\\nmethod of gaining information, and served to keep the troops, during the\\r\\nlong cold winter months, stimulated and keen when otherwise life would\\r\\nhave proved most dull and uninteresting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Third Canadian Division was formed in January and February, 1916.\\r\\nOne infantry brigade was composed of regiments which had been acting as\\r\\nCanadian corps troops, including the Princess Patricia\\'s Canadian Light\\r\\nInfantry, and the Royal Canadian Regiment. The second infantry brigade\\r\\nwas made up of six Canadian mounted rifle regiments, which had comprised\\r\\npart of the cavalry brigade. These two brigades, of the Third Division,\\r\\nunder the command of General Mercer of Toronto, almost immediately began\\r\\nfront-line work.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this period, the Germans, making desperate efforts extending over\\r\\nweeks of time, did their utmost to break through the French line at\\r\\nVerdun and exhaust the French reserves. To offset these objects, a\\r\\nfourth British army was assembled, which took over still more of the\\r\\nFrench line, while a series of British attacks, intended to pin down the\\r\\nGerman reserves all along the line, was inaugurated. One of these\\r\\ndeveloped into a fight for the craters--a terrible struggle at St. Eloi,\\r\\nwhere, blasted from their muddy ditches, with rifles and machine guns\\r\\nchoked with mud and water; with communications lost and lack of\\r\\nartillery support, the men of the Second Canadian Division fought gamely\\r\\nfrom April 6th to April 20th, but were forced to yield the craters and\\r\\npart of their front line system to the enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotwithstanding this the men of the Second Canadian Division at St. Eloi\\r\\nfought quite as nobly as had their brothers of the First Division just a\\r\\nyear before, at the glorious battle of Ypres, a few miles farther north.\\r\\nBut it was a bitter experience. The lesson of failure is as necessary in\\r\\nthe education of a nation as that of success.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 2d and 3d, the Third Canadian Division, which then occupied part\\r\\nof the line in the Ypres salient, including Hooge and Sanctuary Wood,\\r\\nwas smothered by an artillery bombardment unprecedented in length and\\r\\nintensity. Trenches melted into irregular heaps of splintered wood,\\r\\nbroken sand bags and mangled bodies. Fighting gallantly the men of this\\r\\ndivision fell in large numbers, where they stood. The best infantry in\\r\\nthe world is powerless against avalanches of shells projected from\\r\\ngreatly superior numbers of guns. The Canadian trenches were\\r\\nobliterated, not captured.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time Britain had thoroughly learned her lesson, and now\\r\\ncountless shells and guns were pouring into France from Great Britain\\r\\nwhere thousands of factories, new and old, toiled night and day, under\\r\\nthe inspiring energy of Mr. Lloyd George.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 13th, in a terrific counter-attack, the Canadians in turn\\r\\nblasted the Huns from the trenches taken from them a few days before.\\r\\nThe First Canadian Division recaptured and consolidated all the ground\\r\\nand trench systems that had been lost Thus ended the second year of\\r\\nCanadian military operations in the Ypres salient. Each of the three\\r\\nCanadian divisions had been tried by fire in that terrible region, from\\r\\nwhich, it was said, no man ever returned the same as he entered it.\\r\\nBeneath its torn and rifted surface, thousands of Canadians lie, mute\\r\\ntestimony to the fact that love of liberty is still one of the most\\r\\npowerful, yet most intangible, things that man is swayed by.\\r\\n\\r\\nA very distinguished French general, speaking of the part that Canada\\r\\nwas playing in the war, said, \"Nothing in the history of the world has\\r\\never been known quite like it. My countrymen are fighting within fifty\\r\\nmiles of Paris, to push back and chastise a vile and leprous race, which\\r\\nhas violated the chastity of beautiful France, but the Australians at\\r\\nthe Dardanelles and the Canadians at Ypres, fought with supreme and\\r\\nabsolute devotion for what to many must have seemed simple abstractions,\\r\\nand that nation which will support for an abstraction the horror of this\\r\\nwar of all wars will ever hold the highest place in the records of human\\r\\nvalor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fourth Canadian Division reached the Ypres region in August, 1916,\\r\\njust as the other three Canadian divisions were leaving for the Somme\\r\\nbattle-field farther south. For a while it occupied part of the line\\r\\nnear Kemmel, but soon followed the other divisions to the Somme, there\\r\\nto complete the Canadian corps.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be stated here that though a fifth Canadian division was formed\\r\\nand thoroughly trained in England, it never reached France. Canada,\\r\\nuntil the passing of the Military Service Act on July 6,1917, depended\\r\\nsolely on voluntary enlistment. Up to that time Canada, with a\\r\\npopulation of less than 9,000,000, had recruited 525,000 men by\\r\\nvoluntary methods. Of this number 356,986 had actually gone overseas.\\r\\nVoluntary methods at last, however, failed to supply drafts in\\r\\nsufficient numbers to keep up the strength of the depleted reserves in\\r\\nEngland, and in consequence conscription was decided upon. By this\\r\\nmeans, 56,000 men were drafted in Canada before the war ended. In the\\r\\nmeantime, through heavy fighting the demand for drafts became so\\r\\ninsistent that the Fifth Canadian Division in England had to be broken\\r\\nup to reinforce the exhausted fighting divisions in France.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be an incomplete summary of Canada\\'s part in the war that did\\r\\nnot mention some of the men who have been responsible for the success of\\r\\nCanadian arms. It is obviously impossible to mention all of those\\r\\nresponsible; it is even harder to select a few. But looking backward one\\r\\nsees two figures that stand forth from all the rest--General Sir Sam\\r\\nHughes in Canada, and General Sir Arthur Currie commander of the\\r\\nCanadian corps.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo General Sir Sam Hughes must be given the credit of having foreseen\\r\\nwar with Germany and making such preparations as were possible in a\\r\\ndemocracy like Canada. He it was of all others who galvanized Canada\\r\\ninto action; he it was whose enthusiasm and driving power were so\\r\\ncontagious that they affected not only his subordinates but the country\\r\\nat large.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Sam Hughes will be remembered for the building of Valcartier camp\\r\\nand the dispatch of the first Canadian contingent. But he did things of\\r\\njust as great importance. It was he who sought and obtained for Canada,\\r\\nhuge orders for munitions from Great Britain and thereby made it\\r\\npossible for Canada to weather the financial depression, pay her own war\\r\\nexpenditures and emerge from the war in better financial shape than she\\r\\nwas when the war broke out. It was easy to build up a business once\\r\\nestablished but the chief credit must go to the man who established it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Sam Hughes was also responsible for the selection of the officers\\r\\nwho went overseas with the first Canadian contingent. Among those\\r\\nofficers who subsequently became divisional commanders were General Sir\\r\\nArthur Currie, General Sir Richard Turner, General Sir David Watson,\\r\\nGenerals Lipsett, Mercer and Hughes.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf these generals, Sir Arthur Currie through sheer ability ultimately\\r\\nbecame commander of the Canadian corps. This big, quiet man, whose\\r\\nconsideration, prudence and brilliancy had won the absolute confidence\\r\\nof Canadian officers and men alike, welded the Canadian corps into a\\r\\nfighting force of incomparable effectiveness--a force which was set the\\r\\nmost difficult tasks and, as events proved, not in vain.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Canada entered the war she had a permanent force of 3,000 men. When\\r\\nhostilities ceased on November 11, 1918, Canada had sent overseas\\r\\n418,980 soldiers. In addition to this about 15,000 men had joined the\\r\\nBritish Royal Air Service, several hundred physicians and veterinarians,\\r\\nas well as 200 nurses, had been supplied to the British army, while many\\r\\nhundreds of university men had received commissions in the imperial army\\r\\nand navy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September, October and November, 1916, the Canadian corps of four\\r\\ndivisions, which had been welded by General Byng and General Currie into\\r\\nan exceedingly efficient fighting machine, took its part in the battle\\r\\nof the Somme--a battle in which the British army assumed the heaviest\\r\\nshare of the fighting and casualties, and shifted the greatest burden of\\r\\nthe struggle from the shoulders of the French to their own. The British\\r\\narmy had grown vastly in power and efficiency and in growing had taken\\r\\nover more and more of the line from the French.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe battle of the Somme was long and involved. The Franco-British forces\\r\\nwere everywhere victorious and by hard and continuous fighting forced\\r\\nthe Hun back to the famous Hindenburg line. It was in this battle that\\r\\nthe tanks, evolved by the British, were used for the first time, and\\r\\nplayed a most important part in breaking down wire entanglements and\\r\\nrounding up the machine gun nests. The part played in this battle by the\\r\\nCanadian corps was conspicuous, and it especially distinguished itself\\r\\nby the capture of Courcelette. Although the battles which the Canadian\\r\\ncorps took part in subsequently were almost invariably both successful\\r\\nand important, they can be merely mentioned here. The Canadian corps now\\r\\nknown everywhere to consist of shock troops second to none on the\\r\\nwestern front, was frequently used as the spearhead with which to pierce\\r\\nparticularly tough parts of the enemy defenses.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 9th to 13th, 1917, the Canadian corps, with some British\\r\\nsupport, captured Vimy Ridge, a point which had hitherto proved\\r\\ninvulnerable. When a year later, the Germans, north and south, swept the\\r\\nBritish line to one side in gigantic thrusts they were unable to disturb\\r\\nthis key point, Vimy Ridge, which served as an anchor to the sagging\\r\\nline. The Canadian corps was engaged at Arleux and Fresnoy in April and\\r\\nMay and was effective in the operations around Lens in June. Again on\\r\\nAugust 15th, it was engaged at Hill 70 and fought with conspicuous\\r\\nsuccess in that toughest, most difficult, and most heart-breaking of all\\r\\nbattles--Passchendaele.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1918, the Canadian Cavalry Brigade won distinction in the German\\r\\noffensive of March and April. On August 12, 1918, the Canadian corps was\\r\\nengaged in the brilliantly successful battle of Amiens, which completely\\r\\nupset the German offensive plan. On August 26th to 28th the Canadians\\r\\ncaptured Monchy-le-Preux, and, in one of the hammer blows which Foch\\r\\nrained on the German front, were given the most difficult piece of the\\r\\nwhole line to pierce--the Queant-Drocourt line. This section of the\\r\\nfamous Hindenburg line was considered by the enemy to be absolutely\\r\\nimpregnable, but was captured by the Canadians on September 3d and 4th.\\r\\nWith this line outflanked a vast German retreat began, which ended on\\r\\nNovember 11th with the signing of the armistice.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the Canadians fell the honors of breaking through the first\\r\\nHindenburg line by the capture of Cambrai, on October 1st to 9th. They\\r\\nalso took Douai on October 19th, and Dena on October 20th. On October\\r\\n26th to November 2d they had the signal honor of capturing Valenciennes\\r\\nthereby being the first troops to break through the fourth and last\\r\\nHindenberg line.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt surely was a curious coincidence that Mons, from which the original\\r\\nBritish army--the best trained, it is said, that has taken the field\\r\\nsince the time of Caesar--began its retreat in 1914, should have been\\r\\nthe town which Canadian civilians were destined to recapture. The war\\r\\nbegan for the professional British army--the Contemptibles--when it\\r\\nbegan its retreat from Mons in 1914; the war ended for the British army\\r\\nat the very same town four years and three months later, when on the day\\r\\nthe armistice was signed the men from Canada re-entered it. Was it\\r\\ncoincidence, or was it fate?\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the war Canadian troops had sustained 211,000 casualties, 152,000\\r\\nhad been wounded and more than 50,000 had made the supreme sacrifice.\\r\\nPut into different language this means that the number of Canadians\\r\\nkilled was just a little greater than the total number of infantrymen in\\r\\ntheir corps of four divisions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe extent of the work involved in the care of the wounded and sick of\\r\\nthe Canadians overseas may be gathered from the fact that Canada\\r\\nequipped and sent across the Atlantic, 7 general hospitals, 10\\r\\nstationary hospitals, 16 field ambulances, 3 sanitary sections, 4\\r\\ncasualty clearing stations and advanced and base depots of medical\\r\\nstores: The personnel of these medical units consisted of 1,612\\r\\nofficers, 1,994 nursing sisters and 12,382 of other ranks, or a total of\\r\\nabout 16,000. This will give some conception of the importance of the\\r\\ntask involved in the caring for the sick and wounded of about 90,000\\r\\nfighting troops, some 60,000 auxiliary troops behind the lines and the\\r\\nreserve depots in England.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map]\\r\\n  FROM THE VOSGES MOUNTAINS TO YPRES\\r\\n  Map showing the Northeastern frontiers of France, and neutral Belgium\\r\\n  through which the German armies poured in 1914.

There, with the gateway to Paris lying open at its\\r\\nback, the French army, in the longest pitched battle in all history,\\r\\nheld like a cold blue rock against the uttermost man power and resources\\r\\nof the German army.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral von Falkenhayn, Chief of the German General Staff and military\\r\\ndictator of the Teutonic allies, there met disaster and disgrace. There\\r\\nthe mettle of the Crown Prince was tested and he was found to be merely\\r\\na thing of straw, a weak creature whose mind was under the domination of\\r\\nvon Falkenhayn.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the tremendous offensive which was planned to end the war by one\\r\\nterrific thrust, von Falkenhayn had robbed all the other fronts of\\r\\neffective men and munitions. Field Marshal von Hindenburg and his crafty\\r\\nChief of Staff, General Ludendorf, had planned a campaign against Russia\\r\\ndesigned to put that tottering military Colossus out of the war. The\\r\\nplans were upon a scale that might well have proved successful. The\\r\\nKaiser, influenced by the Crown Prince and by von Falkenhayn, decreed\\r\\nthat the Russian campaign must be postponed and that von Hindenburg must\\r\\nsend his crack troops to join the army of the Crown Prince fronting\\r\\nVerdun. Ludendorf promptly resigned as Chief of Staff to von Hindenburg\\r\\nand suggested that the Field Marshal also resign. That grim old warrior\\r\\ndeclined to take this action, preferring to remain idle in East Prussia\\r\\nand watch what he predicted would be a useless effort on the western\\r\\nfront. His warning to the General Staff was explicit, but von Falkenhayn\\r\\ncoolly ignored the message.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map: Verdun in the Southwest corner, to Maucourt toward\\r\\nthe Northeast.]\\r\\n  IMMORTAL VERDUN, WHERE THE FRENCH HELD THE GERMANS WITH THE INSPIRING\\r\\n  SLOGAN \"THEY SHALL NOT PASS\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy did Germany select this particular point for its grand offensive?\\r\\nThe answer is to be found in a demand made by the great Junker\\r\\nassociations of Germany in May, 1915, nine months before the attack was\\r\\nundertaken. That demand was to the effect that Verdun should be attacked\\r\\nand captured. They declared that the Verdun fortifications made a\\r\\nmenacing salient thrust into the rich iron fields of the Briey basin.\\r\\nFrom this metalliferous field of Lorraine came the ore that supplied\\r\\neighty per cent of the steel required for German and Austrian guns and\\r\\nmunitions. These fields of Briey were only twenty miles from the great\\r\\nguns of Verdun. They were French territory at the beginning of the war\\r\\nand had been seized by the army of the Crown Prince, co-operating with\\r\\nthe Army of Metz because of their immense value to the Germans in war\\r\\nmaking.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a preliminary to the battle, von Falkenhayn placed a semicircle of\\r\\nhuge howitzers and rifles around the field of Briey. Then assembling the\\r\\nvast forces drained from all the fronts and having erected ammunition\\r\\ndumps covering many acres, the great battle commenced with a surprise\\r\\nattack upon the village of Haumont on February 21, 1916.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first victory of the Germans at that point was an easy one. The\\r\\ngreat fort of Douaumont was the next objective. This was taken on\\r\\nFebruary 25th after a concentrated bombardment that for intensity\\r\\nsurpassed anything that heretofore had been shown in the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nVon Falkenhayn, personally superintending the disposition of guns and\\r\\nmen, had now penetrated the outer defenses of Verdun. The tide was\\r\\nrunning against the French, and shells, more shells for the guns of all\\r\\ncaliber; men, more men for the earthworks surrounding the devoted city\\r\\nwere needed. The narrow-gauge railway connecting Verdun with the great\\r\\nFrench depots of supplies was totally inadequate for the transportation\\r\\nburdens suddenly cast upon it. In this desperate emergency a transport\\r\\nsystem was born of necessity, a system that saved Verdun. It was fleet\\r\\nupon fleet of motor trucks, all sizes, all styles; anything that could\\r\\npack a few shells or a handful of men was utilized. The backbone of the\\r\\nsystem was a great fleet of trucks driven by men whose average daily\\r\\nrest was four hours, and upon whose horizon-blue uniforms the stains of\\r\\nsnow and sleet, of dust and mud, were indelibly fixed through the\\r\\nwinter, spring, summer and fall of 1916, for the glorious engagement\\r\\ncontinued from February 21st until November 2d, when the Germans were\\r\\nforced into full retreat from the field of honor, the evacuation of Fort\\r\\nVaux putting a period to Germany\\'s disastrous plan and to von\\r\\nFalkenhayn\\'s military career.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Northcliffe, describing the early days of the immortal battle,\\r\\nwrote:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Verdun is, in many ways, the most extraordinary of battles. The mass of\\r\\nmetal used on both sides is far beyond all parallel; the transformation\\r\\non the Douaumont Ridge was more suddenly dramatic than even the battle\\r\\nof the Marne; and, above all, the duration of the conflict already looks\\r\\nas if it would surpass anything in history. More than a month has\\r\\nelapsed since, by the kindness of General Joffre and General Petain, I\\r\\nwas able to watch the struggle from various vital viewpoints. The battle\\r\\nhad then been raging with great intensity for a fortnight, and, as I\\r\\nwrite, four to five thousand guns are still thundering round Verdun.\\r\\nImpossible, therefore, any man to describe the entire battle. The most\\r\\none can do is to set down one\\'s impressions of the first phases of a\\r\\nterrible conflict, the end of which cannot be foreseen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My chief impression is one of admiration for the subtle powers of mind\\r\\nof the French High Command. General Joffre and General Castelnau are men\\r\\nwith especially fine intellects tempered to terrible keenness. Always\\r\\nthey have had to contend against superior numbers. In 1870, when they\\r\\nwere subalterns, their country lost the advantage of its numerous\\r\\npopulation by abandoning general military service at a time when Prussia\\r\\nwas completely realizing the idea of a nation in arms. In 1914, when\\r\\nthey were commanders, France was inferior to a still greater degree in\\r\\npoint of numbers to Prussianized Germany. In armament, France was\\r\\ninferior at first to her enemy. The French High Command has thus been\\r\\ntrained by adversity to do all that human intellect can against almost\\r\\noverwhelming hostile material forces. General Joffre, General\\r\\nCastelnau--and, later, General Petain, who at a moment\\'s notice\\r\\ndisplaced General Herr--had to display genius where the Germans were\\r\\nexhibiting talent, and the result is to be seen at Verdun. They there\\r\\ncaught the enemy in a series of traps of a kind hitherto unknown in\\r\\nmodern warfare--something elemental, and yet subtle, neo-primitive, and\\r\\nbefitting the atavistic character of the Teuton. They caught him in a\\r\\nweb of his own unfulfilled boasts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The enemy began by massing a surprising force on the western front.\\r\\nTremendous energy and organizing power were the marks of his supreme\\r\\nefforts to obtain a decision. It was usually reckoned that the Germans\\r\\nmaintain on all fronts a field army of about seventy-four and a half\\r\\narmy corps, which at full strength number three million men. Yet, while\\r\\nholding the Russians from Riga to the south of the Pripet Marshes, and\\r\\nmaintaining a show of force in the Balkans, Germany seems to have\\r\\nsucceeded in bringing up nearly two millions and a half of men for her\\r\\ngrand spring offensive in the west. At one time her forces in France and\\r\\nFlanders were only ninety divisions. But troops and guns were withdrawn\\r\\nin increasing numbers from Russia and Serbia in December, 1915, until\\r\\nthere were, it is estimated, a hundred and eighteen divisions on the\\r\\nFranco-British-Belgian front. A large number of six-inch and twelve-inch\\r\\nAustrian howitzers were added to the enormous Krupp batteries. Then a\\r\\nlarge proportion of new recruits of the 1916 class were moved into\\r\\nRhine-land depots to serve as drafts for the fifty-nine army corps, and\\r\\nit is thought that nearly all the huge shell output that had accumulated\\r\\nduring the winter was transported westward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The French Staff reckoned that Verdun would be attacked when the ground\\r\\nhad dried somewhat in the March winds. It was thought that the enemy\\r\\nmovement would take place against the British front in some of the\\r\\nsectors of which there were chalk undulations, through which the rains\\r\\nof winter quickly drained. The Germans skilfully encouraged this idea by\\r\\nmaking an apparent preliminary attack at Lions, on a five-mile front\\r\\nwith rolling gas-clouds and successive waves of infantry. During this\\r\\nfeint the veritable offensive movement softly began on Saturday,\\r\\nFebruary 19, 1916, when the enormous masses of hostile artillery west,\\r\\neast, and north of the Verdun salient started registering on the French\\r\\npositions. Only in small numbers did the German guns fire, in order not\\r\\nto alarm their opponents. But even this trial bombardment by shifts was\\r\\na terrible display of power, calling forth all the energies of the\\r\\noutnumbered French gunners to maintain the artillery duels that\\r\\ncontinued day and night until Monday morning, February 21st.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph]\\r\\n  AMMUNITION FOR THE GUNS\\r\\n  Canadian narrow-gauge line taking ammunition up the line through a\\r\\n  shattered village.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Truck convoy running parallel to troops marching.]\\r\\n  HOW VERDUN WAS SAVED\\r\\n  The motor transport never faltered when the railroads were put out of\\r\\n  action.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph]\\r\\n  NURSE EDITH CAVELL\\r\\n  A victim of German savagery.

Y.\\r\\n  CAPTAIN CHARLES A. FRYATT\\r\\n  The martyred British Merchant-Marine Captain, who was executed by the\\r\\n  Germans because his ship attempted to sink a German submarine which\\r\\n  attacked her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The enemy seems to have maintained a bombardment all round General\\r\\nHerr\\'s lines on February 21, 1916, but this general battering was done\\r\\nwith a thousand pieces of field artillery. The grand masses of heavy\\r\\nhowitzers were used in a different way. At a quarter past seven in the\\r\\nmorning they concentrated on the small sector of advanced intrenchments\\r\\nnear Brabant and the Meuse; twelve-inch shells fell with terrible\\r\\nprecision every few yards, according to the statements made by the\\r\\nFrench troops. I afterwards saw a big German shell, from at least six\\r\\nmiles distant from my place of observation, hit quite a small target. So\\r\\nI can well believe that, in the first bombardment of French positions,\\r\\nwhich had been photographed from the air and minutely measured and\\r\\nregistered by the enemy gunners in the trial firing, the great,\\r\\ndestructive shots went home with extraordinary effect. The trenches were\\r\\nnot bombarded--they were obliterated. In each small sector of the\\r\\nsix-mile northward bulge of the Verdun salient the work of destruction\\r\\nwas done with surprising quickness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After the line from Brabant to Haumont was smashed, the main fire power\\r\\nwas directed against the other end of the bow at Herbebois, Ornes, and\\r\\nMaucourt. Then when both ends of the bow were severely hammered, the\\r\\ncentral point of the Verdun salient, Caures Woods, was smothered in\\r\\nshells of all sizes, poured in from east, north and west. In this manner\\r\\nalmost the whole enormous force of heavy artillery was centered upon\\r\\nmile after mile of the French front. When the great guns lifted over the\\r\\nlines of craters, the lighter field artillery placed row after row in\\r\\nfront of the wreckage, maintained an unending fire curtain over the\\r\\ncommunicating saps and support intrenchments.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then came the second surprising feature in the new German system of\\r\\nattack. No waves of storming infantry swept into the battered works.\\r\\nOnly strong patrols at first came cautiously forward, to discover if it\\r\\nwere safe for the main body of troops to advance and reorganize the\\r\\nFrench line so as to allow the artillery to move onward. There was thus\\r\\na large element of truth in the marvelous tales afterwards told by\\r\\nGerman prisoners. Their commanders thought it would be possible to do\\r\\nall the fighting with long-range artillery, leaving the infantry to act\\r\\nas squatters to the great guns and occupy and rebuild line after line of\\r\\nthe French defenses without any serious hand-to-hand struggles. All they\\r\\nhad to do was to protect the gunners from surprise attack, while the\\r\\nguns made an easy path for them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, ingenious as was this scheme for saving the man-power of Germany\\r\\nby an unparalleled expenditure of shell, it required for full success\\r\\nthe co-operation of the French troops. But the French did not\\r\\nco-operate. Their High Command had continually improved their system of\\r\\ntrench defense in accordance with the experiences of their own hurricane\\r\\nbombardments in Champagne and the Carency sector. General Castelnau, the\\r\\nacting Commander-in-Chief on the French front, was indeed the inventor\\r\\nof hurricane fire tactics, which he had used for the first time in\\r\\nFebruary, 1915, in Champagne. When General Joffre took over the conduct\\r\\nof all French operations, leaving to General Castelnau the immediate\\r\\ncontrol of the front in France, the victor of the battle of Nancy\\r\\nweakened his advance lines and then his support lines, until his troops\\r\\nactually engaged in fighting were very little more than a thin covering\\r\\nbody, such as is thrown out towards the frontier while the main forces\\r\\nconnect well behind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall see the strategical effect of this extraordinary measure in\\r\\nthe second phase of the Verdun battle, but its tactical effect was to\\r\\nleave remarkably few French troops exposed to the appalling tempest of\\r\\nGerman and Austrian shells. The fire-trench was almost empty, and in\\r\\nmany cases the real defenders of the French line were men with machine\\r\\nguns, hidden in dug-outs at some distance from the photographed\\r\\npositions at which the German gunners aimed. The batteries of light\\r\\nguns, which the French handled with the flexibility and continuity of\\r\\nfire of Maxims, were also concealed in widely scattered positions. The\\r\\nmain damage caused by the first intense bombardment was the destruction\\r\\nof all the telephone wires along the French front. In one hour the\\r\\nGerman guns plowed up every yard of ground behind the observing posts\\r\\nand behind the fire trench. Communications could only be slowly\\r\\nre-established by messengers, so that many parties of men had to fight\\r\\non their own initiative, with little or no combination of effort with\\r\\ntheir comrades.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yet, desperate as were their circumstances, they broke down the German\\r\\nplan for capturing trenches without an infantry attack. They caught the\\r\\npatrols and annihilated them, and then swept back the disillusioned and\\r\\nreluctant main bodies of German troops. First, the bombing parties were\\r\\nfelled, then the sappers as they came forward to repair the line for\\r\\ntheir infantry, and at last the infantry itself in wave after wave of\\r\\nfield-gray. The small French garrison of every center of resistance\\r\\nfought with cool, deadly courage, and often to the death.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Artillery fire was practically useless against them, for though their\\r\\ntunnel shelters were sometimes blown in by the twelve-inch shells, which\\r\\nthey regarded as their special terror by reason of their penetrative\\r\\npower and wide blast, even the Germans had not sufficient shells to\\r\\nsearch out all their underground chambers, every one of which have two\\r\\nor three exits.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The new organization of the French Machine-gun Corps was a fine factor\\r\\nin the eventual success. One gun fired ten thousand rounds daily for a\\r\\nweek, most of the positions selected being spots from which each German\\r\\ninfantry advance would be enfiladed and shattered. Then the French 75\\'s\\r\\nwhich had been masked during the overwhelming fire of the enemy\\r\\nhowitzers, came unexpectedly into action when the German infantry\\r\\nattacks increased in strength. Near Haumont, for example, eight\\r\\nsuccessive furious assaults were repulsed by three batteries of 75\\'s.\\r\\nOne battery was then spotted by the Austrian twelve-inch guns, but it\\r\\nremained in action until all its ammunition was exhausted. The gunners\\r\\nthen blew up their guns and retired, with the loss of only one man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Von Falkenhayn had increased the Crown Prince\\'s army from the fourteen\\r\\ndivisions--that battled at Douaumont Fort--to twenty-five divisions. In\\r\\nApril he added five more divisions to the forces around Verdun by\\r\\nweakening the effectives in other sectors and drawing more troops from\\r\\nthe Russian front. It was rumored that von Hindenburg was growing\\r\\nrestive and complaining that the wastage at Verdun would tell against\\r\\nthe success of the campaign on the Riga-Dvinsk front, which was to open\\r\\nwhen the Baltic ice melted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Great as was the wastage of life, it was in no way immediately\\r\\ndecisive. But when the expenditure of shells almost outran the highest\\r\\nspeed of production of the German munition factories, and the wear on\\r\\nthe guns was more than Krupp and Skoda could make good, there was danger\\r\\nto the enemy in beginning another great offensive likely to overtax his\\r\\nshellmakers and gunmakers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nImmortal and indomitable France had won over her foe more power than she\\r\\nhad possessed even after the battle of the Marne.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the entire summer Verdun, with the whole population of France\\r\\nroused to the supreme heights of heroism behind it, held like a rock.\\r\\nWave after wave of Germans in gray-green lines were sent against the\\r\\ntwenty-five miles of earthworks, while the French guns took their toll\\r\\nof the crack German regiments. German dead lay upon the field until\\r\\nexposed flesh became the same ghastly hue of their uniforms. No Man\\'s\\r\\nLand around Verdun was a waste and a stench.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Joffre\\'s plan was very simple. It was to hold out. As was\\r\\nafterwards revealed, much to the satisfaction of the French people, Sir\\r\\nDouglas Haig had placed himself completely at the service of the French\\r\\nCommander-in-Chief, and had suggested that he should use the British\\r\\narmy to weaken the thrust at Verdun. But General Joffre had refused the\\r\\nproffered help. No man knew better than he what his country, with its\\r\\nexceedingly low birthrate, was suffering on the Meuse. He had but to\\r\\nsend a telegram to British Headquarters, and a million Britons, with\\r\\nthousands of heavy guns, would fling themselves upon the German lines\\r\\nand compel Falkenhayn to divide his shell output, his heavy artillery,\\r\\nand his millions of men between Verdun and the Somme. But General\\r\\nJoffre, instead of sending the telegram in question, merely dispatched\\r\\nofficers to British Headquarters to assure and calm the chafing Scotsman\\r\\ncommanding the military forces of the British Empire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout that long summer the battle cry of Verdun, \"Ne passeront\\r\\npas!\" (\"They shall not pass!\"), was an inspiration to the French army\\r\\nand to the world. Then as autumn drifted its red foliage over the\\r\\nheights surrounding the bloody field, the French struck back. General\\r\\nNivelle, who had taken command at Verdun under Joffre, commenced a\\r\\nseries of attacks and a persistent pressure against the German forces on\\r\\nboth sides of the Meuse. These thrusts culminated in a sudden sweeping\\r\\nattack which on October 24th, resulted in the recapture by Nivelle\\'s\\r\\nforces of Fort Douaumont and on November 2d, in the recapture of Fort\\r\\nVaux.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus ended in glory the most inspiring battle in the long and honorable\\r\\nhistory of France.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXVII\\r\\n\\r\\nMURDERS AND MARTYRS\\r\\n\\r\\nMany examples might be cited to show that the Central empires were dead\\r\\nto the humanities. There were apparently no limits to the brutality of\\r\\nthe German war-makers. Among the outstanding deeds of the Teutons that\\r\\nsickened the world was the killing of Miss Edith Cavell, an English\\r\\nnurse working in Belgian hospitals.\\r\\n\\r\\nA shudder of horror circled the world when announcement was formally\\r\\nmade that this splendid woman was sentenced to death and murdered by a\\r\\nGerman firing squad at two o\\'clock on the morning of October 12, 1915.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe killing of this gentle-natured, brave woman typified to the world\\r\\nGermany\\'s essentially brutal militarism. It placed the German military\\r\\ncommand in a niche of dishonor unique in all history.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe specific charge against Miss Cavell was that she had helped English\\r\\nand French soldiers and Belgian young male civilians to cross the border\\r\\ninto Holland. The direct evidence against her was in the form of letters\\r\\nintercepted by the Germans in which some of these soldiers and civilians\\r\\nwriting from England thanked her for the aid she had given to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon the farcical trial that resulted in the predetermined sentence of\\r\\ndeath, Miss Cavell courageously and freely admitted her assistance in\\r\\nthe specified cases of escape. When she was asked why she did it, she\\r\\ndeclared her fear that if she had not done so the men would have been\\r\\nshot by the Germans. Her testimony was given in a clear conversational\\r\\ntone that betrayed no nervousness and her entire bearing was such as to\\r\\nwin the sympathy of everyone except her stony-hearted judges.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German officers in command at Brussels made it impossible for Miss\\r\\nCavell to see counsel before the trial, and a number of able lawyers who\\r\\nwere solicited to undertake her defense declined to do so because of\\r\\ntheir fear of the Germans.\\r\\n\\r\\nSentence was imposed upon her at five o\\'clock on the afternoon of\\r\\nOctober 11th. In accordance with its terms, she was taken from her cell\\r\\nand placed against a blank wall at two o\\'clock the following\\r\\nmorning--the darkness of the hour vying with the blackness of the deed.\\r\\nMr. Gahan, the English clergyman connected with the prison, was\\r\\npermitted to see her a short time before her murder. He gave her Holy\\r\\nCommunion at ten o\\'clock on the night of October 11th. To him she\\r\\ndeclared she was happy in her contemplation of death; that she had no\\r\\nregret for what she had done; and that she was glad to die for her\\r\\ncountry.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrand Whitlock, American Minister to Belgium, and Hugh Gibson, Secretary\\r\\nof the Legation, did all that was humanly possible to avert the crime,\\r\\nbut without avail. They were told that, \"the Emperor himself could not\\r\\nintervene.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDefending the murder, Dr. Alfred Zimmermann, German Under Secretary for\\r\\nForeign Affairs, callously disposed of the matter thus:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see from the English and American press that the shooting of an\\r\\nEnglishwoman and the condemnation of several other women in Brussels for\\r\\ntreason has caused a sensation, and capital against us is being made out\\r\\nof the fact. Men and women are equal before the law, and only the degree\\r\\nof guilt makes a difference in the sentence for the crime and its\\r\\nconsequences.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMonuments to Edith Cavell were reared in widely scattered communities. A\\r\\nmountain was named in her honor. Her murder multiplied enlistments and\\r\\nfed the fires of patriotism throughout the Allied countries. In the end,\\r\\nGermany lost heavily. The Teutons aimed to strike terror into the hearts\\r\\nof men and women. They only succeeded in arousing a righteous anger that\\r\\nultimately destroyed the Imperial government.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother instance equally flagrant of the utter callousness of the men\\r\\nwho at that time ruled Germany, was the murder of Captain Fryatt, a\\r\\ngallant British seaman, who had dared to attack the pirates of the\\r\\nunder-seas.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Charles Fryatt was the master of the steamship Brussels, a\\r\\nmerchant vessel owned by the Great Eastern Railway. It was captured by\\r\\nthe Germans on June 23, 1916. Captain Fryatt was taken to Zeebrugge. A\\r\\ncourt-martial went through the motions of a trial at Bruges on July\\r\\n27th. The charge against Captain Fryatt was that of attempting to ram\\r\\nthe German submarine U-33.\\r\\n\\r\\nMute testimony against Captain Fryatt was a gold watch found upon his\\r\\nperson. This carried an inscription testifying that the watch had been\\r\\npresented by the mayor and people of Harwich in recognition of the\\r\\nCaptain\\'s bravery in attempting to ram a submarine, and his successful\\r\\nescape when the U-boat called upon him to surrender.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prisoners who were captured with Captain Fryatt were sent to the\\r\\nprison camp at Ruhlaben, but Captain Fryatt was condemned to death as a\\r\\n\"franc-tireur.\" The news of the murder was sent to the world through a\\r\\nGerman communique dated July 28th. It stated:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe accused was condemned to death because, although he was not a member\\r\\nof a combatant force, he made an attempt on the afternoon of March 20,\\r\\n1915, to ram the German submarine U-33 near the Maas lightship. The\\r\\naccused, as well as the first officer and the chief engineer of the\\r\\nsteamer, received at the time from the British Admiralty a gold watch as\\r\\na reward of his brave conduct on that occasion, and his action was\\r\\nmentioned with praise in the House of Commons.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the occasion in question, disregarding the U-boat\\'s signal to stop\\r\\nand show his national flag, he turned at a critical moment at high speed\\r\\non the submarine, which escaped the steamer by a few meters only by\\r\\nimmediately diving. He confessed that in so doing he had acted in\\r\\naccordance with the instructions of the Admiralty. One of the many\\r\\nnefarious franc-tireur proceedings of the British merchant marine\\r\\nagainst our war vessels has thus found a belated but merited expiation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis brutal action by Germany coming after the murder of Edith Cavell\\r\\ncreated intense indignation throughout the world. It ranked with the\\r\\npoison gas at Ypres, the Lusitania, the Belgian atrocities, the killing\\r\\nof Edith Cavell and the unrestricted submarine sinkings, as a factor in\\r\\narousing the democratic peoples of the world to a fighting pitch.\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany sowed its seeds of destruction in the wind that bore the fumes\\r\\nof poison gas, and in the ruthless brutality that decreed the sinking of\\r\\nthe Lusitania and the murders of Edith Cavell and Captain Fryatt.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt reaped the whirlwind in the world-wide wrath that brought America\\r\\ninto the war, and that visited disgrace and defeat upon the German\\r\\nEmpire.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXVIII\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SECOND BATTLE OF YPRES\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst to feel the effects of German terrorism through poison gas were\\r\\nthe gallant Canadian troops on the afternoon of April 22, 1915, at\\r\\nYpres, Belgium. Gas had been used by the Germans previously to this, but\\r\\nthey were mere experimental clouds directed against Belgian troops.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the battle, the English and Canadians held a line from\\r\\nBroodseinde to half a mile north of St. Julien on the crest of the\\r\\nGrafenstafel Ridge. The French prolonged the line to Steenstraate on the\\r\\nYperlee Canal. The Germans originally planned the attack for Tuesday,\\r\\nApril 20th, but with satanic ingenuity the offensive was postponed until\\r\\nbetween 4 and 5 o\\'clock on the afternoon of Thursday, the 22d. During\\r\\nthe morning the wind blew steadily from the north and the scientists\\r\\nattached to the German Field Headquarters predicted that the strong wind\\r\\nwould continue at least twelve hours longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Canadian division held a line extending about five miles from the\\r\\nYpres-Roulers Railway to the Ypres-Poelcapelle road. The division\\r\\nconsisted of three infantry brigades, in addition to the artillery\\r\\nbrigades. Upon this unsuspecting body of men the poison fumes were\\r\\nprojected by means of pipes and force pumps. The immediate consequences\\r\\nwere that the asphyxiating gas of great intensity rendered immediately\\r\\nhelpless thousands of men. The same gas attack that was projected upon\\r\\nthe Canadians also fell with murderous effect upon the French. The\\r\\nconsequences were that the French division on the left of the Canadians\\r\\ngave way and the Third brigade of the Canadian division, so far as the\\r\\nleft was concerned, was \"up in the air,\" to use the phrase of its\\r\\ncommanding officer.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt became necessary for Brigadier-General Turner, commanding the Third\\r\\nbrigade, to throw back his left flank southward to protect his rear.\\r\\nThis caused great confusion, and the enemy, advancing rapidly, took a\\r\\nnumber of guns and many prisoners, penetrating to the village of St.\\r\\nJulien, two miles in the rear of the original French trenches. The\\r\\nCanadians fought heroically, although greatly outnumbered and pounded by\\r\\nartillery that inflicted tremendous losses. The Germans, as they came\\r\\nthrough the gas clouds, were protected by masks moistened with a\\r\\nsolution containing bi-carbonate of soda.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tactics of General Turner off-set the numerical superiority of the\\r\\nenemy, and prevented a disastrous rout. General Curry, commanding the\\r\\nSecond brigade of Canadians, repeated this successful maneuver when he\\r\\nflung his left flank southward and, presenting two fronts to the enemy,\\r\\nheld his line of trenches from Thursday at 5 o\\'clock until Sunday\\r\\nafternoon. The reason the trenches were held no longer than Sunday\\r\\nafternoon was that they had been obliterated by heavy artillery fire.\\r\\nThe Germans finally succeeded in capturing a line, the forward point of\\r\\nwhich was the village of St. Julien. Reinforcements under General\\r\\nAlderson had come up by this time and the enemy\\'s advance was suddenly\\r\\nchecked. Enemy attacks upon the line running from Ypres to Passchendaele\\r\\ncompletely broke down under the withering fire of the reinforced and\\r\\nreformed artillery and infantry brigades. The record officer of the\\r\\nCanadians makes this comment of the detailed fighting:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story of the second battle of Ypres is the story of how the Canadian\\r\\ndivision, enormously outnumbered--for they had in front of them at least\\r\\nfour divisions, supported by immensely heavy artillery, with a gap still\\r\\nexisting, though reduced, in their lines, and with dispositions made\\r\\nhurriedly under the stimulus of critical danger, fought through the day\\r\\nand through the night, and then through another day and night; fought\\r\\nunder their officers until, as happened to so many, those perished\\r\\ngloriously, and then fought from the impulsion of sheer valor because\\r\\nthey came from fighting stock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe enemy, of course, was aware--whether fully or not may perhaps be\\r\\ndoubted--of the advantage his breach in the line had given him, and\\r\\nimmediately began to push a formidable series of attacks upon the whole\\r\\nof the newly-formed Canadian salient. The attack was everywhere fierce,\\r\\nbut developed with particular intensity at this moment upon the apex of\\r\\nthe newly-formed line, running in the direction of St. Julien.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has already been stated that some British guns were taken in a wood\\r\\ncomparatively early in the evening of the 22d. In the course of that\\r\\nnight, and under the heaviest machine-gun fire, this wood was assaulted\\r\\nby the Canadian Scottish, Sixteenth battalion of the Third brigade, and\\r\\nthe Tenth battalion of the Second brigade, which was intercepted for\\r\\nthis purpose on its way to a reserve trench. The battalions were\\r\\nrespectively commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Leckie and\\r\\nLieutenant-Colonel Boyle, and after a most fierce struggle in the light\\r\\nof a misty moon they took the position at the point of the bayonet. At\\r\\nmidnight the Second battalion, under Colonel Watson, and the Toronto\\r\\nregiment, Queen\\'s Own, Third battalion, under Lieutenant-Colonel Rennie,\\r\\nboth of the First brigade, brought up much-needed reinforcement, and\\r\\nthough not actually engaged in the assault, were in reserve.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll through the following days and nights these battalions shared the\\r\\nfortunes and misfortunes of the Third brigade. An officer who took part\\r\\nin the attack describes how the men about him fell under the fire of the\\r\\nmachine guns, which, in his phrase, played upon them \"like a watering\\r\\npot.\" He added quite simply \"I wrote my own life off.\" But the line\\r\\nnever wavered. When one man fell another took his place, and with a\\r\\nfinal shout the survivors of the two battalions flung themselves into\\r\\nthe wood. The German garrison was completely demoralized, and the\\r\\nimpetuous advance of the Canadians did not cease until they reached the\\r\\nfar side of the wood and intrenched themselves there in the position so\\r\\ndearly gained. They had, however, the disappointment of finding that the\\r\\nguns had been blown up by the enemy, and later on in the same night a\\r\\nmost formidable concentration of artillery fire, sweeping the wood as a\\r\\ntropical storm sweeps the leaves from a forest, made it impossible for\\r\\nthem to hold the position for which they had sacrificed so much.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fighting continued without intermission all through the night, and,\\r\\nto those who observed the indications that the attack was being pushed\\r\\nwith ever-growing strength, it hardly seemed possible that the\\r\\nCanadians, fighting in positions so difficult to defend and so little\\r\\nthe subject of deliberate choice, could maintain their resistance for\\r\\nany long period. At 6 A. M. on Friday it became apparent that the left\\r\\nwas becoming more and more involved, and a powerful German attempt to\\r\\noutflank it developed rapidly. The consequences, if it had been broken\\r\\nor outflanked, need not be insisted upon. They were not merely local.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was there decided, formidable as the attempt undoubtedly was, to try\\r\\nand give relief by a counter-attack upon the first line of German\\r\\ntrenches, now far, far advanced from those originally occupied by the\\r\\nFrench. This was carried out by the Ontario First and Fourth battalions\\r\\nof the First brigade, under Brigadier-General Mercer, acting in\\r\\ncombination with a British brigade.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map: Ypres and the surroundings.]\\r\\n  THE TOWN OF YPRES IS FULL OF MEMORIES FOR THE CANADIANS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is safe to say that the youngest private in the rank, as he set his\\r\\nteeth for the advance, knew the task in front of him, and the youngest\\r\\nsubaltern knew all that rested upon its success. It did not seem that\\r\\nany human being could live in the shower of shot and shell which began\\r\\nto play upon the advancing troops. They suffered terrible casualties.\\r\\nFor a short time every other man seemed to fall, but the attack was\\r\\npressed ever closer and closer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fourth Canadian battalion at one moment came under a particularly\\r\\nwithering fire. For a moment--not more--it wavered. Its most gallant\\r\\ncommanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Burchill, carrying, after an old\\r\\nfashion, a light cane, coolly and cheerfully rallied his men and, at the\\r\\nvery moment when his example had infected them, fell dead at the head of\\r\\nhis battalion. With a hoarse cry of anger they sprang forward (for,\\r\\nindeed they loved him), as if to avenge his death. The astonishing\\r\\nattack which followed--pushed home in the face of direct frontal fire\\r\\nmade in broad daylight by battalions whose names should live forever in\\r\\nthe memories of soldiers--was carried to the front line of the German\\r\\ntrenches. After a hand-to-hand struggle the last German who resisted was\\r\\nbayoneted, and the trench was won.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe measure of this success may be taken when it is pointed out that\\r\\nthis trench represented in the German advance the apex in the breach\\r\\nwhich the enemy had made in the original line of the Allies, and that it\\r\\nwas two and a half miles south of that line. This charge, made by men\\r\\nwho looked death indifferently in the face (for no man who took part in\\r\\nit could think that he was likely to live) saved, and that was much, the\\r\\nCanadian left. But it did more. Up to the point where the assailants\\r\\nconquered, or died, it secured and maintained during the most critical\\r\\nmoment of all the integrity of the allied line. For the trench was not\\r\\nonly taken, it was held thereafter against all comers, and in the teeth\\r\\nof every conceivable projectile, until the night of Sunday, the 25th,\\r\\nwhen all that remained of the war-broken but victorious battalion was\\r\\nrelieved by fresh troops.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXIX\\r\\n\\r\\nZEPPELIN RAIDS ON FRANCE AND ENGLAND\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of warfare in the air has been a dream of romancers from a\\r\\nperiod long before Jules Verne. Indeed, balloons were used for\\r\\nobservation purposes in the eighteenth century by the French armies. The\\r\\ncrude balloon of that period, in a more developed form, was used in the\\r\\nFranco-Prussian War, and during the siege of Paris by its assistance\\r\\ncommunication was kept up between Paris and the outside world. Realizing\\r\\nits possibilities inventors had been trying to develop a balloon which\\r\\ncould be propelled against the wind and so guided that explosives could\\r\\nbe dropped upon a hostile army. Partially successful dirigible balloons\\r\\nhave been occasionally exhibited for a number of years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of such a balloon took a strong hold upon the imagination of\\r\\nthe German army staff long before the Great War, and Count Ferdinand\\r\\nZeppelin gave the best years of his life to its development. From the\\r\\nbeginning he met with great difficulties. His first ships proved\\r\\nmechanical failures, and after these difficulties were overcome he met\\r\\nwith a series of accidents which almost put an end to his efforts. By\\r\\npopular subscription, and by government support, he was able to\\r\\ncontinue, and when the war began Germany had thirty-five dirigible\\r\\nballoons of the Zeppelin and other types, many of them as much as 490\\r\\nfeet long.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Zeppelin balloon, called the Zeppelin from the name of its inventor,\\r\\nwas practically a vast ship, capable of carrying a load of about fifteen\\r\\nthousand pounds. It would carry a crew of twenty men or more, fuel for\\r\\nthe engines, provisions, a wireless installation, and armament with\\r\\nammunition. For a journey of twenty hours such a vessel would need at\\r\\nleast seven thousand pounds of fuel. It would probably be able to carry\\r\\nabout two tons of explosives. These Zeppelins could travel great\\r\\ndistances. Before the war one of them flew from Lake Constance to\\r\\nBerlin, a continuous flight of about one thousand miles, in thirty-one\\r\\nhours.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese great aerial warships were given a thorough trial by the Germans.\\r\\nThey disliked to admit that they had made a costly mistake in adding\\r\\nthem to their armament. It soon turned out, however, that the Zeppelins\\r\\nwere practically useless in battle. Whatever they could do, either for\\r\\nscouting purposes or in dropping explosives behind the enemy\\'s lines,\\r\\ncould be better done by the airplane. The French and the English, who\\r\\nbefore the war had decided that the airplane was the more important\\r\\nweapon, were right. But the Germans did not give up their costly toy so\\r\\neasily, and they determined to use it in the bombardment of cities and\\r\\ndistricts situated far away from the German line, in dropping bombs, not\\r\\nupon fortifications, or armed camps where they might meet with\\r\\nresistance, but upon peaceful non-belligerents in the streets of great\\r\\nunfortified cities.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was their policy of frightfulness once again. And once again they had\\r\\nmade a mistake. The varied expeditions of the Zeppelin airships sent\\r\\nfrom Germany to bombard Paris, or to cross the Channel and, after\\r\\ndropping bombs on seaside resorts, to wander over the city of London in\\r\\nthe hope of spreading destruction there, did little real damage and\\r\\ntheir net effects, from a military point of view, were practically nil.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Zeppelin raid upon England took place on January 19, 1915. The\\r\\nZeppelins passed over the cities of Yarmouth, Cromer, Sherringham and\\r\\nKing\\'s Lynn. On this expedition there were two Zeppelins. They reached\\r\\nthe coast of Norfolk about 8.30 in the evening and then steered\\r\\nnorthwest across the country toward King\\'s Lynn, dropping bombs as they\\r\\nwent. In these towns there were no military stations and the damage\\r\\nsuffered was very slight. Nine persons were killed, all civilians. This\\r\\nraid was followed by many others, which at first usually wasted their\\r\\nammunition, dropping their bombs on small country towns or in empty\\r\\nfields.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 31st of May an expedition reached London and killed six persons\\r\\nin the east end. The result of this raid was to stir the English to\\r\\nintense indignation. Mobs gathered in the London streets, and persons\\r\\nsuspected of being Germans, or with German sympathies, were attacked.\\r\\nOther raids followed, none of them doing serious military damage, but\\r\\nusually killing or wounding innocent non-combatants. The stupid policy\\r\\nof secrecy which they maintained during the first year of the war\\r\\nunfortunately permitted great exaggeration of the real damages which\\r\\nthey had suffered.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the first year, according to Mr. Balfour, in eighteen Zeppelin\\r\\nraids there were only seventy-one civilian adults and eighteen children\\r\\nkilled, one hundred and eighty-nine civilian adults and thirty-one\\r\\nchildren wounded. No soldier or sailor was killed and only seven\\r\\nwounded.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn France similar attacks had been made on Paris and Calais. On the 20th\\r\\nof March two Zeppelins dropped bombs on Paris, but Paris, unlike London,\\r\\nwas a fortified city, and the sky soldiers were driven off by the\\r\\nanti-aircraft guns. The French also devised an efficient method of\\r\\ndefense. On the appearance of an airship great searchlights flashed into\\r\\nthe air and the enemy was made at once a target, not only for the guns\\r\\nof all the forts, but also for airplane attack. In order to attack\\r\\nsuccessfully a Zeppelin it was necessary that an airplane should attain\\r\\na position above the enemy. For an airplane to rise to such a height\\r\\ntime was required, as the airplane rises slowly. The French, therefore,\\r\\ndevised a scheme by which two or more airplanes were kept constantly\\r\\ncircling at a very great height above the city. Relays were formed which\\r\\nrelieved each other at regular intervals. When an airship approached it\\r\\nwould therefore be compelled in the first place to pass through the fire\\r\\nof the guns on the great forts, and then would find in the air above\\r\\nairplanes in waiting. The Germans, therefore, practically gave up\\r\\nattacks upon Paris. They were dangerous.\\r\\n\\r\\nLondon, practically unarmed, seemed to them an easy mark. But the\\r\\nBritish Lion was now awake. The English had been taken by surprise. They\\r\\nattempted at first, in an unorganized way, to protect their city, and,\\r\\nthough occasionally successful in destroying an airship through the\\r\\ngallantry of some individual hero, they soon found that their defense\\r\\nmust be organized, and Admiral Sir Percy Scott was entrusted with the\\r\\ntask. Lights were extinguished on the streets and screened on the water\\r\\nfront. Illumination for advertising purposes was forbidden; windows were\\r\\ncovered, so that London became at night a mass of gloom. The Zeppelins,\\r\\ncompelled to fly at a very great height, because of anti-aircraft guns,\\r\\nwere blinded. As in Paris airplanes were constantly kept on the alert\\r\\nand searchlights and anti-airship guns placed at every convenient point.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe suggestion was made that the English should undertake reprisals, but\\r\\nthe suggestion was strongly opposed on the ground that the British\\r\\nshould not be a \"party to a line of conduct condemned by every\\r\\nright-thinking man of every civilized nation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe effect of the English improved defenses was soon obvious, when the\\r\\nGerman expeditions began to lose airship after airship. Under the new\\r\\nregime, when such an attack was signaled, the whole city immediately\\r\\nreceived warning and the sky was swept by dozens of searchlights. Safe\\r\\nretreats were ready for those who cared to use them, but ordinarily the\\r\\nwhole population rushed out to watch the spectacle. Airplanes would dash\\r\\nat the incoming foe; the searchlights would be switched off and the guns\\r\\nbe silent to avoid hindering the aviators. Then would come the attack\\r\\nand Zeppelin after Zeppelin would be seen falling, a great mass of\\r\\nflames, while their companions would hurry back across the Channel. Even\\r\\nthere they would not be safe, for many an airship was brought down on\\r\\nEnglish fields, or on the waters of the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Germans, however, did not confine their policy of frightfulness in\\r\\nthe air to the performances of their Zeppelins. Before the Zeppelins had\\r\\ncrossed the Channel their airplanes had visited England. On Christmas\\r\\nDay, 1914, an airplane attacked Dover, doing, however, no damage. Other\\r\\nairplanes also visited the British Isles from time to time, dropping\\r\\nbombs, and as the Germans began to lose faith in the efficacy of their\\r\\nZeppelin fleets they began more and more to substitute airplanes for\\r\\ntheir airships.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn some of these expeditions much more damage was done than had ever\\r\\nbeen done by the Zeppelins. The airplane expedition grew serious in the\\r\\nyear 1917; between May 23d and June 16th of that year there were five\\r\\nsuch aerial attacks. The airplanes could not only move with greater\\r\\nspeed but with better direction. An attack on May 25th resulted in the\\r\\nkilling of seventy-six persons and the injuring of one hundred and\\r\\nseventy-four, the principal victims being women and children. This was\\r\\nat the town of Folkestone on the southeast coast. In this attack there\\r\\nwere about sixteen airplanes, and the time of the attack was not more\\r\\nthan three minutes. Scarcely any part of Folkestone escaped injury. The\\r\\nattack was methodically organized. Four separate squadrons passed over\\r\\nthe city, following each other at short intervals. It was impossible to\\r\\ntell when the attack would end, and people in shelters or cellars were\\r\\nkept waiting for hours without being able to feel certain that the\\r\\ndanger had passed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph]\\r\\n  AN AIRPLANE ALARM\\r\\n  Sailors dashing to the fighting tops of a battleship and putting an\\r\\n  anti-aircraft gun in action to repel a hostile airplane.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Painting]\\r\\n  LONDON\\'S WELCOME TO A ZEPPELIN RAIDER\\r\\n  In the early part of the war Zeppelin raids on England were frequent.\\r\\n  The rapid perfecting of searchlights, anti-aircraft guns and airplane\\r\\n  defenses soon discouraged them. This picture shows an airplane about\\r\\n  to attack with flaming bullets.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph]\\r\\n  GUARDING PARIS FROM THE HUN\\r\\n  Observation post fitted with instruments for gauging the height and\\r\\n  speed of enemy aircraft, a giant searchlight, a listening post and a\\r\\n  \"75\" gun installed on the outskirts of Paris.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is probable that one of the motives of these raids was to keep at\\r\\nhome fleets of English airplanes which might be more useful on the\\r\\nfront. Indeed, many Englishmen, alarmed by the damage, urged such a\\r\\npolicy, but the good sense of the English leaders prevented such a\\r\\nmistake from being made. Pitiful as must have been the suffering in\\r\\nindividual cases, the whole of the damage caused by the German\\r\\nfrightfulness was but a trifle as compared with the usefulness of the\\r\\nEnglish air-fleets when directly sent against the German armies.\\r\\nNevertheless, every squadron of German airplanes sent to England was\\r\\nattacked by British aviators, and in those attacks the Germans suffered\\r\\nmany losses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map]\\r\\n  THE FIRST GERMAN ARMY WHICH INVADED FRANCE (1,200,000) WOULD HAVE\\r\\n  STRETCHED FROM PARIS INTO RUSSIA (1,200 MILES) IF MARCHING IN SINGLE\\r\\n  FILE\\r\\n\\r\\nThe worst raid of all those made was one on June 13th, which was\\r\\ndirected upon the city of London. On that occasion ninety-seven persons\\r\\nwere killed and four hundred and thirty-seven wounded. These airplane\\r\\noperations differed from the Zeppelin expeditions in being carried on in\\r\\nthe daytime, and this raid took place while the schools were in session\\r\\nand large numbers of people were in the street. Only one of the\\r\\nattacking airplanes was brought down. The raiding machines were of a new\\r\\ntype, about three times the size of the ordinary machine, and there were\\r\\ntwenty-two such machines in the squadron. The battle in the air was a\\r\\nstriking spectacle and in spite of the danger was watched by millions of\\r\\nthe population. The raiders were easily seen and their flight seemed\\r\\nlike a flight of swallows as they dived and swerved through the air.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe raids on England were not the only raids conducted by the Germans\\r\\nduring the war. Paris suffered, but as soon as the warning sounded, the\\r\\nsky over the city was alive with defense airplanes. An attack on the\\r\\nFrench capital took place on the 27th of July and began about midnight.\\r\\nThe German airmen, however, never got further than a suburban section of\\r\\nthe city, and their bombardment caused but little damage. In one of the\\r\\nsuburbs, however, a German flyer dropped four bombs on a Red Cross\\r\\nHospital, killing two doctors, a chemist and a male nurse, and injuring\\r\\na number of patients. The raider was flying low and the distinguishing\\r\\nmarks of the hospital were plainly apparent.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost every day during the bitter fighting of 1918, reports came in\\r\\nthat Allied hospitals had been bombed by German raiders. Attacks on\\r\\nhospitals were, of course, strictly forbidden by the Hague Convention,\\r\\nand they caused bitter indignation. Such attacks were of a piece with\\r\\nthose upon hospital ships which were made from time to time. From the\\r\\nvery beginning of the war the Germans could not understand the\\r\\npsychology of the people of the Allied countries. They were not fighting\\r\\nwith slaves, ready to cower under the lash, but with free people, ready\\r\\nto fight for liberty and roused to fury by lawlessness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXX\\r\\n\\r\\nRED REVOLUTION IN RUSSIA\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russian Revolution was not a sudden movement of the people. Long\\r\\nbefore the war it had raised its head. The Duma itself came into\\r\\nexistence as one of its fruits; but when the war began all parties\\r\\njoined in patriotic support of the Russian armies and laid aside for the\\r\\ntime their cherished grievances. The war was immensely popular. Slavonic\\r\\nnationalism turned against Austria-Hungary and Germany who were bent\\r\\nupon crushing the Slavonic sister state, Serbia. The Liberal elements\\r\\nsaw in Germany the stronghold of reaction and of militarism, and trusted\\r\\nthat its downfall would be followed by that of Russian autocracy. But so\\r\\nglaring was the incapacity of the old regime, that a union was formed\\r\\nduring the war by all the Liberal parties. This group united on the\\r\\nsingle aim of pushing on the war, and silently preparing for the moment\\r\\nwhen the catastrophe to Czarism was to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was long before the revolution. But a conviction of the necessity\\r\\nof immediate change gradually came to all. The Czar himself brought\\r\\nmatters to an issue. His vacillation, his appointment of ministers who\\r\\nwere not only reactionary, but were suspected of being German tools,\\r\\nwere too much for even honest supporters of the Imperial regime. Some of\\r\\nthese reactionaries, it is true, were easily driven from power. In 1915\\r\\nSukhomlinov and Maklakov were overthrown by the influence of the army\\r\\nand the Duma. But in 1916 the parasites came to life again. M. Boris\\r\\nStuermer became Prime Minister, and appointed as Minister of the\\r\\nInterior the notorious Protopopov. On November 14, 1916, Miliukov, the\\r\\nleader of the Constitutional Democrats, or Cadet Party, attacked the\\r\\nPremier in one of the fiercest speeches ever made in the Russian Duma.\\r\\nStuermer was compelled to resign, but his successor, M. Trepov, though\\r\\nan honest man with high ambitions, was forced to retain Protopopov at\\r\\nthe Interior. For a moment there was calm. But it was the calm before\\r\\nthe storm.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russian Revolution, now recognized as the most bloody revolution in\\r\\nhistory, began with the assassination of a single man. This man was\\r\\nGregory Novikh, known throughout the world under the name of Rasputin. A\\r\\nSiberian peasant by birth, immoral, filthy in person, untrained in mind,\\r\\nhe had early received the nickname of Rasputin, which means\\r\\n\"ne\\'er-do-well,\" on account of his habits. A drunkard, and a libertine\\r\\nalways, he posed as a sort of saint and miracle worker, let his hair\\r\\ngrow long, and tramped about the world barefoot.\\r\\n\\r\\nRasputin had left his district of Tobolsk and at Moscow had started a\\r\\nnew cult, where mystical seances were mingled with debauchery. Through\\r\\nMadame Verubova he had been introduced to the Empress herself. He became\\r\\nthe friend of Count Witte, of Stuermer, and Protopopov was his tool.\\r\\nRumor credited him with exercising an extraordinary influence upon the\\r\\nCzarina, and through her upon the Czar. This influence was thought to be\\r\\nresponsible for many of the Czar\\'s unpopular policies. In times of great\\r\\npublic agitation the wildest rumors are easily taken for truth and the\\r\\nabsurd legends which were easily associated with his name were greedily\\r\\naccepted by people of every rank. The influence of Rasputin over the\\r\\nImperial family was denied again and again. It has been said from\\r\\nauthoritative sources that the Czar did not know him by sight, and that\\r\\nthe Czarina knew him only as a superstitious and neurotic woman might\\r\\nknow some fortune teller or other charlatan. Nevertheless the credulous\\r\\npublic believed him to be the evil spirit of the Imperial circle, and\\r\\nevery false move, every unpopular act, was ascribed to his baneful\\r\\ninfluence. But such a career could not last long, and the end became a\\r\\ntragedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral times Rasputin had been attacked, but had escaped. At last, on\\r\\nthe 29th of December, 1916, Prince Yusapov, a young man of wealth and\\r\\nposition, invited him to dine with him at his own home. The Prince came\\r\\nfor him in his own car. Entering the dining-room, they found there the\\r\\nGrand Duke Dmitri Pavlovitch. M. Purishkevitch, a member of the Duma,\\r\\nhad acted as chauffeur, and he followed him in. The three told him that\\r\\nhe was to die and he was handed a pistol that he might kill himself;\\r\\ninstead of doing so, he shot at the Grand Duke, but missed, and then was\\r\\nshot in turn by his captors. The noise attracted the attention of the\\r\\npolice who inquired what had happened. \"I have just killed a dog,\" was\\r\\nthe reply.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis body was taken in an automobile to the Neva River, a hole cut in the\\r\\nice, and weighted with stones, it was dropped into the waters. On the\\r\\nnext day his executioners notified the police of what they had done, and\\r\\nthe news was announced at the Imperial Theatre, whose audience went wild\\r\\nwith enthusiasm, and sang the National Hymn. No legal action was ever\\r\\ntaken against Rasputin\\'s executioners. His body was recovered and given\\r\\nhonorable burial. The Czarina, according to report, following the coffin\\r\\nto the grave. And so disappeared from the Imperial Court one evil force.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut his tool, Alexander Protopopov, still survived. Protopopov was an\\r\\nextraordinary man. In 1916 he had visited England and France and made a\\r\\nsplendid impression. His speeches, full of fire and patriotism, were\\r\\nregarded as the best made by any deputation that had come from Russia.\\r\\nBut on his return to Petrograd he fell completely into the hands of the\\r\\nCourt party. He became associated with Rasputin, and his wild talk and\\r\\nrestless conduct suggested to many that his mind had become affected.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the death of Rasputin, the meeting of the Duma, which should have\\r\\ntaken place on January 25, 1917, was postponed for a month. The\\r\\ncensorship was drawn tighter, the members of the secret police were\\r\\ngreatly increased, and a deliberate endeavor, under the direction of\\r\\nProtopopov was made to encourage an abortive revolution, so that its\\r\\noverthrow might establish the reactionaries in power. But the attempt\\r\\nfailed.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring January and February the people were calm. No one wanted\\r\\nrevolution then. On February 9th, the labor members of the War Industry\\r\\nCommittee were arrested. This was regarded as plainly provocative, and\\r\\nM. Miliukov wrote appeals to the people for patience. These were\\r\\nsuppressed, but no disturbance ensued. A British Commission, then on a\\r\\nvisit to Russia, reported that there was no danger of revolution. But\\r\\nthe people were hungry. Speakers in the Duma discussed the food problem.\\r\\nIt became harder and harder to procure bread, and little that was\\r\\npractical seemed to be done to improve the situation, though in some\\r\\nparts of the country there were large surplus stocks. On March 8th\\r\\ncrowds gathered around the bakery shops, and looted several of them. The\\r\\nnext day the crowds in the streets increased. Groups of Cossacks rode\\r\\nhere and there, fraternizing with the people. They, too, were hungry. In\\r\\nthe afternoon two workmen were arrested for disorder by the police. A\\r\\nband of Cossacks freed them. Street speakers began to appear here and\\r\\nthere, and crowds gathered to listen to their fiery denunciations of the\\r\\ngovernment.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 11th, General Khabalov, military governor of the city, issued a\\r\\nproclamation announcing that the police had orders to disperse all\\r\\ncrowds, and that any workman who did not return to work on Monday\\r\\nmorning would be sent to the trenches. The main streets of the city were\\r\\ncleared and guarded by the police and soldiery. The crowds were\\r\\nenormous, and disorderly, and more than two hundred of the rioters were\\r\\nkilled. Yet it seemed as if the government had the situation in a firm\\r\\ngrasp, though an ominous incident was that the Pavlovsk regiment on\\r\\nbeing ordered to fire upon the mob, mutinied and had to be ordered to\\r\\ntheir quarters.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime Rodzianko, the President of the Duma, had telegraphed to the\\r\\nCzar:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSituation serious. Anarchy reigns in Capital. Government is paralyzed.\\r\\nTransport food and fuel supplies are utterly disorganized. General\\r\\ndiscontent is growing. Disorderly firing is going on in streets. Various\\r\\ncompanies of soldiers are shooting at each other. It is absolutely\\r\\nnecessary to invest someone, who enjoys the confidence of the people,\\r\\nwith powers to form a new government. No time must be lost, and delay\\r\\nmay be fatal. I pray to God that in this hour responsibility may not\\r\\nfall on the wearer of the crown.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Prime Minister, Prince Golitzin, acting under powers which he had\\r\\nreceived from the Czar, prorogued the Duma. But the Duma refused to be\\r\\nprorogued. Its President, Rodzianko, holding in his hand the order for\\r\\ndissolution, announced that the Duma was now the sole constitutional\\r\\nauthority of Russia.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the night following, the soldiers at the Capital, and the\\r\\nSocialists, decided upon their course. The soldiers determined that they\\r\\nwould not fire upon their civilian brothers. The Socialists planned an\\r\\nalternative scheme of government.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March the 12th, the city was taken possession of by a mob. The Preo\\r\\nCrajenski Guards refused to fire upon the crowd. The Volynsky regiment,\\r\\nsent to coerce them, joined in the mutiny. Followed by the mob, the two\\r\\nregiments seized the arsenal. A force of 25,000 soldiers was in the\\r\\nrevolt. At 11 A. M., the Courts of Law were set on fire and the fortress\\r\\nof SS. Peter and Paul was seized. The police, fighting desperately, were\\r\\nhunted from their quarters, their papers destroyed and the prisoners,\\r\\npolitical and criminal, released from the jails.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the day the Duma kept in constant session, awaiting the Emperor,\\r\\nwho did not come. Telegram after telegram was sent him, each more\\r\\nurgent. There is reason to believe that these telegrams never reached\\r\\nthe Czar. When information finally did come to him it was too late.\\r\\nMeantime the Duma appointed an executive committee. Their names were\\r\\nRodzianko, Nekrasov, Konovalov, Dmitrikov, Lvov, Rjenski, Karaulov,\\r\\nMiliukov, Schledlovski, Schulgin, Tcheidze and Kerensky. The workmen and\\r\\nsoldiers also formed a committee, which undertook to influence the\\r\\ntroops now pouring into Petrograd. But the center of the revolution was\\r\\nstill the Duma, and crowds gathered to listen to its speeches. In the\\r\\nevening Protopovo surrendered to the Russian guards, but General\\r\\nKhabalov still occupied the Admiralty building with such forces as were\\r\\nfaithful.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 13th it became evident that the army in the field were\\r\\naccepting the authority of the provisional government. The Duma\\r\\ncommittee was composed mainly of men of moderate political views. They\\r\\nmoved slowly, fearing on the one hand the Reactionaries who still\\r\\npreserved their loyalty to the Czar, and on the other hand the Council\\r\\nof Labor, with its extreme views, and its influence--with the troops.\\r\\nThe siege of the Admiralty building was ended by the surrender of\\r\\nGeneral Khabalov. The police, however, were still keeping up a desultory\\r\\nresistance, but the mob were hunting them like wild beasts. On\\r\\nWednesday, the 14th of March, the revolution was over.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Executive Committee of the Duma and the Council of the Workmen\\'s and\\r\\nSoldiers\\' Delegates, now universally known as the Soviet, were working\\r\\nin harmony. Every hour proclamations were issued, some of them foolish,\\r\\nsome of them, it is thought, inspired by German agents, and some of them\\r\\nwise and patriotic. One of the most unfortunate of these proclamations\\r\\nwas one to the army directing that \"the orders of the War Committee must\\r\\nbe obeyed, saving only on those occasions when they shall contravene the\\r\\norders and regulations of the labor deputies and military delegates.\"\\r\\nThis same proclamation abolished saluting for private soldiers off duty.\\r\\nIt was the beginning of the destruction of the Russian military power.\\r\\nThe proclamation of the Duma committee itself was admirable:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCITIZENS:\\r\\nThe Provisional Executive Committee of the Duma, with the aid and\\r\\nsupport of the garrison of the capital and its inhabitants, has now\\r\\ntriumphed over the baneful forces of the old regime in such a manner as\\r\\nto enable it to proceed to the more stable organization of the executive\\r\\npower. With this object, the Provisional Committee will name ministers\\r\\nof the first national cabinet, men whose past public activity assures\\r\\nthem the confidence of the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new cabinet will adopt the following principles as the basis of its\\r\\npolicy:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. An immediate amnesty for all political and religious offenses,\\r\\nincluding military revolts, acts of terrorism, and agrarian crimes.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Freedom of speech, of the press, of associations and labor\\r\\norganizations, and the freedom to strike; with an extension of these\\r\\nliberties to officials and troops, in so far as military and technical\\r\\nconditions permit.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. The abolition of social, religious, and racial restrictions and\\r\\nprivileges.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Immediate preparation for the summoning of a Constituent Assembly,\\r\\nwhich, with universal suffrage as a basis, shall establish the\\r\\ngovernmental regime and the constitution of the country.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. The substitution for the police of a national militia, with elective\\r\\nheads and subject to the self-governing bodies.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Communal elections to be carried out on the basis of universal\\r\\nsuffrage.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. The troops that have taken part in the revolutionary movement shall\\r\\nnot be disarmed, but they are not to leave Petrograd.\\r\\n\\r\\n8. While strict military discipline must be maintained on active\\r\\nservice, all restrictions upon soldiers in the enjoyment of social\\r\\nrights granted to other citizens are to be abolished.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime the Emperor, \"the Little Father,\" at first thoroughly\\r\\nincredulous of the gravity of the situation, had at last become alarmed.\\r\\nHe appointed General Ivanov Commander-in-Chief of the army, and ordered\\r\\nhim to proceed to Petrograd at the head of a division of loyal troops.\\r\\nGeneral Ivanov set out, but his train was held up at Tsarkoe Selo, and\\r\\nhe returned to Pskov. The Czar himself then started for the city, but\\r\\nhe, too, was held up at the little station of Bologoi, where workmen had\\r\\npulled up the track, and he returned to Pskov.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sent for Ruzsky and declared that he was ready to yield to the Duma\\r\\nand grant a responsible ministry. Ruzsky advised him to get in touch\\r\\nwith Rodzianko, and as a result of a telephone communication with\\r\\nRodzianko and with several of his trusted generals, it became clear that\\r\\nthere was no other course than abdication. Guchkov and Shulgin,\\r\\nmessengers from the Duma, arrived on the evening of March 15th, and\\r\\nfound the Emperor alone, except for his aide-de-camp, Count Fredericks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you want me to do?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must abdicate,\" Guchkov told him, \"in favor of your son, with the\\r\\nGrand Duke Michael Alexandrovitch as Regent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Emperor sat for a long time silent. \"I cannot be separated from my\\r\\nboy,\" he said. \"I will hand the throne to my brother.\" Taking a sheet of\\r\\npaper he wrote as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the Grace of God, We, Nicholas II, Emperor of all the Russias, to all\\r\\nour faithful subjects:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the course of a great struggle against a foreign enemy, who has been\\r\\nendeavoring for three years to enslave our country, it has pleased God\\r\\nto send Russia a further bitter trial. Internal troubles have threatened\\r\\nto compromise the progress of the war. The destinies of Russia, the\\r\\nhonor of her heroic army, the happiness of her people, and the whole\\r\\nfuture of our beloved country demand that at all costs victory shall be\\r\\nwon. The enemy is making his last efforts, and the moment is near when\\r\\nour gallant troops, in concert with their glorious Allies, will finally\\r\\noverthrow him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn these days of crisis we have considered that our nation needs the\\r\\nclosest union of all its forces for the attainment of victory. In\\r\\nagreement with the Imperial Duma, we have recognized that for the good\\r\\nof our land we should abdicate the throne of the Russian state and lay\\r\\ndown the supreme power.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot wishing to separate ourselves from our beloved son, we bequeath our\\r\\nheritage to our brother, the Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovitch, with our\\r\\nblessing upon the future of the Russian throne. We bequeath it to him\\r\\nwith the charge to govern in full unison with the national\\r\\nrepresentatives who may sit in the legislature, and to take his\\r\\ninviolable oath to them in the name of our well-beloved country.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe call upon all faithful sons of our land to fulfil this sacred and\\r\\npatriotic duty in obeying their Emperor at this painful moment of\\r\\nnational trial, and to aid him, together with the representatives of the\\r\\nnation, to lead the Russian people in the way of prosperity and glory.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay God help Russia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSo ended the reign of Nicholas the Second, Czar of all the Russias. The\\r\\nnews of the Czar\\'s abdication spread over the world with great rapidity,\\r\\nand was received by the Allies with mixed feelings. The Czar had been\\r\\nscrupulously loyal to the alliance. He was a man of high personal\\r\\ncharacter, and his sympathies on the whole, liberal; but he was a weak\\r\\nman in a position in which even a strong man might have failed. He was\\r\\neasily influenced, especially by his wife. Warned again and again of the\\r\\ndanger before him, he constantly promised improvement, only to fail in\\r\\nkeeping his promises. He deeply loved his wife, and yielded continually\\r\\nto her unwise advice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Empress Alexandra Feodorovna is but another instance of a devoted\\r\\nqueen who dethroned her consort. She believed in Divine Right and looked\\r\\nwith suspicion upon popular leaders. Her one object in life was to hand\\r\\non the Russian crown to her son, with no atom of its power diminished.\\r\\nShe surrounded herself and her husband with scoundrels and charlatans.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the whole, the feeling among the Allies was one of relief. There was\\r\\na general distrust of the influences which had been surrounding the\\r\\nCzar. The patriotism of the Grand Duke Michael was well known, and a\\r\\ngovernment conducted by him was sure to be a great improvement. But it\\r\\nwas not to be. Before the news of the abdication reached Petrograd a new\\r\\nministry had been formed by the Duma. Miliukov announced their names and\\r\\nexplained their credentials. The Prime Minister was Prince George Lvov.\\r\\nMiliukov was Minister of Foreign Affairs, Guchkov Minister of War and\\r\\nMarine, Kerensky, a new name in the government, Minister of Justice. The\\r\\nministry included representatives of every party of the left and center.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiliukov declared that their credentials came from the Russian\\r\\nrevolution: \"We shall not fight for the sake of power. To be in power is\\r\\nnot a reward or pleasure but a sacrifice. As soon as we are told that\\r\\nthe sacrifice is no longer needed, we shall give up our places with\\r\\ngratitude for the opportunity which has been accorded us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe concluded by informing his hearers that the despot who had brought\\r\\nRussia to the brink of ruin would either abdicate of his free will, or\\r\\nbe deposed. He added that the Grand Duke Michael would be appointed\\r\\nRegent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis announcement at once produced an explosion. A ministry of moderates\\r\\nand a continuance of the Imperial government under a regency stirred the\\r\\ndelegates of the workmen and soldiers to revolt. For a time it seemed as\\r\\nif the new government would disappear in the horrors of mob rule. But\\r\\nKerensky saved the situation. Making his way into the meeting of the\\r\\nSoviet he burst into an impassioned speech.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Comrades!\" he cried, \"I have been appointed Minister of Justice. No one\\r\\nis a more ardent Republican than I, but we must bide our time. Nothing\\r\\ncan come to its full growth at once. We shall have our Republic but we\\r\\nmust first win the war. The need of the moment is organization and\\r\\ndiscipline and that need will not wait.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis eloquence carried the day. The Soviet passed a resolution supporting\\r\\nthe provisional government with only fifteen dissenting votes. But it\\r\\nhad been made clear that the people did not approve of the regency, and\\r\\non the night of the 15th of March, Prince Lvov, Kerensky and other\\r\\nleaders of the Duma sought out the Grand Duke Michael and informed him\\r\\nof the situation. The Grand Duke yielded to the people, and on Friday,\\r\\nMarch the 16th, issued a declaration which ended the power of the\\r\\nRomanovs in Russia:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI am firmly resolved to accept the supreme power only if this should be\\r\\nthe desire of our great people, who must, by means of a plebiscite\\r\\nthrough their representatives in the Constituent Assembly, establish the\\r\\nform of government and the new fundamental laws of the Russian state.\\r\\nInvoking God\\'s blessing, I, therefore, request all citizens of Russia to\\r\\nobey the provisional government, set up on the initiative of the Duma,\\r\\nand invested with plenary powers, until within as short a time as\\r\\npossible the Constituent Assembly elected on a basis of equal, universal\\r\\nand secret suffrage, shall enforce the will of the nation regarding the\\r\\nfuture form of the constitution.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this declaration the sacred monarchy had disappeared. In one week\\r\\nthe people had come to their own and Russia was free. But what form of\\r\\nnew government was to replace the old regime was still the question.\\r\\nThere were two rival theories as to the principles to be followed, one\\r\\nthat of the Moderates, the other of the Extremists. The Moderates, who\\r\\ncontrolled the provisional government were practical men. They realized\\r\\nthat Russia was at war and that efficient administration was the great\\r\\nneed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Extremists of the Soviet were a different type of men. They were\\r\\nprofoundly ignorant of all practical questions of government; their\\r\\ncreed was socialism. The Socialistic party in Russia may be divided into\\r\\nthree different groups. The first, the Social Revolutionary party, came\\r\\ninto prominence in Russia about 1900. It was composed of followers of\\r\\nthe Russian Lavrov who believed in the socialist state, but a state\\r\\nwhich should not be a tyrant overriding the individual. Liberty was his\\r\\nwatchword and he made his appeal not only to the workmen in the shops\\r\\nbut with a special force to the peasant. He did not preach class war in\\r\\nthe ordinary sense, and believed in the value of national life. To this\\r\\nparty belonged Kerensky, more and more becoming the leader of the\\r\\nrevolutionary movement.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second group of the Socialist party were the Bolsheviki. This group\\r\\nwere followers of the German Karl Marx. The revolution which they sought\\r\\nwas essentially a class revolution. To the Bolsheviki the fate of their\\r\\ncountry mattered not at all. They were eager for peace on any terms. The\\r\\nonly war in which they were interested was a class war; they recognized\\r\\nno political boundaries. The leader of this group was Vladimir Iljetch\\r\\nUljanov, who, under his pen name of Lenine, was already widely known and\\r\\nwho had now obtained the opportunity which he had long desired.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third group were the Mensheviki. The Mensheviki believed in the\\r\\nimportance of the working classes, but they did not ignore other\\r\\nclasses. They were willing to use existing forms of government to carry\\r\\nout the reforms they desired. They saw that the Allied cause was their\\r\\nown cause, the cause of the workman as well as the intellectual.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Soviet contained representatives of these three groups. It did not\\r\\nrepresent Russia, but it was in Petrograd and could exert its influence\\r\\ndirectly upon the government.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attitude of the provisional government toward the Imperial family\\r\\nwas at first not unkindly. The Czar and the Czarina were escorted to the\\r\\nAlexandrovsky Palace in Tsarskoe-Selo. The Czar for a time lived quietly\\r\\nas plain Nicholas Romanov. The Czarina and her children were very ill\\r\\nwith measles, the case of the little Prince being complicated by the\\r\\nbreaking out of an old wound in his foot. The Grand Duchess Tatiana was\\r\\nin a serious condition and oxygen had been administered. As his family\\r\\nimproved in health the Czar amused himself by strolls in the palace\\r\\nyard, and even by shoveling snow. Later on Nicholas was transferred to\\r\\nTobolsk, Siberia, and then, in May, 1918, to Yekaterinberg. His wife and\\r\\nhis daughter Marie accompanied him to the latter place, while Alexis and\\r\\nhis other three daughters remained in Tobolsk. On July 20th a Russian\\r\\ngovernment dispatch announced his assassination. It read as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the first session of the Central Executive Committee, elected by the\\r\\nFifth Congress of the Councils, a message was made public that had been\\r\\nreceived by direct wire from the Ural Regional Council, concerning the\\r\\nshooting of the ex-Czar, Nicholas Romanov. Recently Yekaterinberg, the\\r\\nCapital of the Red Urals, was seriously threatened by the approach of\\r\\nCzecho-Slovak bands, and a counter-revolutionary conspiracy was\\r\\ndiscovered, which had as its object the wresting of the ex-Czar from the\\r\\nhands of the Council\\'s authority. In view of this fact the President of\\r\\nthe Ural Regional Council decided to shoot the ex-Czar, and the decision\\r\\nwas carried out on July 16th.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wife and the son of Nicholas Romanov had been sent to a place of\\r\\nsecurity. In a detailed account of the execution, published in Berlin,\\r\\nit appeared that the Czar had been awakened at five o\\'clock in the\\r\\nmorning, and informed that he was to be executed in two hours. He spent\\r\\nsome time with a priest in his bedroom and wrote several letters.\\r\\nAccording to this account, when the patrol came to take him out for\\r\\nexecution he was found in a state of collapse. His last words, uttered\\r\\njust before the executioners fired, are reported to have been \"Spare my\\r\\nwife and my innocent and unhappy children. May my blood preserve Russia\\r\\nfrom ruin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russian press, including the Socialist papers, condemned the\\r\\nexecution as a cruel and unnecessary act. The charges of conspiracy were\\r\\nutterly unproven, and were merely an excuse. The Central Executive\\r\\nCommittee, however, accepted the decision of the Ural Regional Soviet as\\r\\nbeing regular, and a decree by the Bolshevist Government declared all\\r\\nthe property of the former Emperor, his wife, his mother and all the\\r\\nmembers of the Imperial house, forfeit to the Soviet Republic.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime the provisional government, which had taken power on the 16th\\r\\nof March, seemed as if it might succeed. Miliukov, whose announcement of\\r\\nthe Regency had made him unpopular, declared for a Republic. The great\\r\\narmy commanders for the most part accepted the revolution. The Grand\\r\\nDuke Nicholas was removed from his command and the other Grand Dukes\\r\\nwere ordered not to leave Petrograd. Alexiev became commander-in-chief;\\r\\nRuzsky had the northern group of armies, Brusilov the southern; Kornilov\\r\\nwas in command of Petrograd, and the central group was put under the\\r\\ncommand of Lechitsky. Reports came that discipline was improving\\r\\neverywhere on the front.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map of Petrograd]\\r\\n  CAPITAL OF THE NEW REPUBLIC OF RUSSIA\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plans of the government, too, met with general approval. Their\\r\\npolicy was announced by Prince Lvov. \"The new government considers it\\r\\nits duty to make known to the world that the object of free Russia is\\r\\nnot to dominate other nations and forcibly to take away their territory.\\r\\nThe object of independent Russia is a permanent peace and the right of\\r\\nall nations to determine their own destiny.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKerensky, in inspiring speeches, encouraged the country to war, and\\r\\ndeclared against a separate peace. The new government announced that\\r\\nPoland was to receive complete independence, with a right to determine\\r\\nits own form of government, and its relation, if any, to Russia. In\\r\\nFinland the Governor, Sein, was removed. A Liberal was appointed\\r\\nGovernor and the Finnish Diet was convened. A manifesto was issued on\\r\\nMarch 21st, completely restoring the Finnish constitution. To the\\r\\nArmenians Kerensky expressed himself as in favor of an autonomous\\r\\ngovernment for them, under Russia\\'s protection, and on March 25th,\\r\\nabsolute equality of the Jews was proclaimed by the new government. A\\r\\nnumber of Jews were made officers in the army, and two Jewish advocates\\r\\nwere appointed members of the Russian Senate and of the Supreme Court.\\r\\nOn April 4th full religious liberty was proclaimed, and on the same date\\r\\nthe Prime Minister promised a delegation of women that women would be\\r\\ngiven the right to vote.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese acts caused a general subsidence of unrest, and public good\\r\\nfeeling was increased by the return of the political exiles and\\r\\nprisoners from Siberia. A full hundred thousand of such prisoners were\\r\\nreleased, and their progress across Siberia to Russia was one grand\\r\\ntriumphal march.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most celebrated of these political prisoners were two women,\\r\\nCatherine Breshkovskaya and Marie Spiridonova. Catherine Breshkovskaya\\r\\nwas known as the grandmother of the revolution. Forty-four years of her\\r\\nlife were spent in exile. When she reached Petrograd she was met at the\\r\\nrailroad depot by a military band, and carried in procession through the\\r\\nstreets. Equally popular was Marie Spiridonova, who, though still young,\\r\\nhad suffered martyrdom. She had been tortured with cruelty that is\\r\\nunprintable. Her face had been disfigured for life. The agents who had\\r\\ninflicted the torture were assassinated by the revolutionists.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a great day for Russia, and the outlook seemed full of promise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXI\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE DESCENT TO BOLSHEVISM\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hopes entertained for the new Republic of Russia were doomed to\\r\\ndisappointment. For a short time, under the leadership of Lvov, the\\r\\nRussians marched along the path of true democracy. But the pace became\\r\\ntoo rapid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government prospered in Petrograd, and the economic organization of\\r\\nthe country proceeded with great speed. An eight-hour day was introduced\\r\\nin the capital and in many other cities throughout the republic. The\\r\\nfever of organization spread even to the peasants. They formed a Council\\r\\nof Peasants\\' Deputies, modeled after the Council of Workmen and\\r\\nSoldiers. On the 13th of April, 1917, came the first meeting of the\\r\\nAll-Russia Congress of Soviets, and with it a revival of the differences\\r\\nof opinion which ultimately were to destroy the government. The great\\r\\nmajority were for war, but the minority, led by Lenine and the\\r\\nBolsheviki element, demanded an immediate peace. They declared that the\\r\\nenemies of the Revolution were not the Central Powers; but the\\r\\ncapitalists in all countries, and not least the Provisional Government\\r\\nof Russia.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome clew to the meaning of the Bolsheviki movement in Russia is to be\\r\\nfound in the life of Lenine, its leading spirit. It has been charged\\r\\nthat he was the tool of the German Government. He undoubtedly received\\r\\nfacilities from the German Government to return to Russia from\\r\\nSwitzerland immediately after the Revolution in March. His whole career,\\r\\nhowever, suggests that he was not a tool, but a fanatic.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was born in Simbirsk, in Central Russia, in the year 1870. Lenine was\\r\\nonly one of the several aliases that he had found it necessary to adopt\\r\\nat various times. He was of good family, and received his education at\\r\\nthe Petrograd University. From the very beginning he took an active\\r\\ninterest in the political and social problems of the day. In 1887 his\\r\\nbrother, A. Uljanov, was arrested, and after a secret trial condemned to\\r\\ndeath and hanged as a participant in a plot to wreck the imperial train\\r\\ncarrying Alexander III. Lenine was also arrested, but was released on\\r\\naccount of a lack of evidence. At this time the Russian Socialistic\\r\\nmovement was still in its infancy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph: About 50 women in military uniforms.]\\r\\n  Copyright Underwood and Underwood, N.

Along with this\\r\\npropaganda work he studied deeply the economic phases of Russian life,\\r\\nbeing especially interested in its working and peasant classes. He wrote\\r\\nseveral books on the subject, which are still accepted as valuable\\r\\nrepresentatives of Russian economic literature. Because of his\\r\\nsocialistic activities, Lenine was compelled to leave Russia on several\\r\\noccasions, when he lived in Switzerland, France and Austria. From these\\r\\ncountries he directed the work of one of the groups of the Social\\r\\nDemocratic party, and became an important leader.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the General Russian Socialistic Convention, held in 1903, this group\\r\\nmade a definite stand for its program and policies. This was the time\\r\\nwhen the word \"Bolsheviki\" was coined, meaning the \"majority,\" who had\\r\\nvoted in accord with Lenine\\'s proposals. Lenine believed in the seizure\\r\\nof political power by means of violent revolution and in establishing a\\r\\nproletarian government. After the Revolution of 1905, the Lenine faction\\r\\ndwindled and it seemed as if Bolshevism was destined to die out. But in\\r\\n1911, with the awakening of a new spirit in the political and social\\r\\nlife of Russia, a new impetus was given to the activities of the\\r\\nBolsheviki. The first Socialist daily paper, Pravda, (\"the Truth,\") was\\r\\none of their efforts. In 1913 the Bolsheviki sent six representatives to\\r\\nthe Duma.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the outbreak of the war Lenine was in Cracow. Like other\\r\\nrevolutionary leaders he was compelled to live in exile. He went to\\r\\nSwitzerland where he remained until the news of the successful\\r\\nrevolution caused his return to Russia. On his arrival in Petrograd he\\r\\ngathered together his followers and began the agitation in favor of the\\r\\nBolshevist program and of peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first sign of the conflict between the Provisional Government and\\r\\nthe Soviet arose in connection with the joint note sent to the Allies by\\r\\nthe Provisional Government on May 1st. This note was signed by Foreign\\r\\nSecretary Miliukov. It declared, among other things, that the\\r\\nProvisional Government would \"maintain a strict regard for its\\r\\nengagements with the Allies of Russia.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe document aroused strong disapproval among many members of the\\r\\nCouncil of the Soviet, and serious anti-government demonstrations\\r\\noccurred in Petrograd on May 3d and 4th. These demonstrations were\\r\\ndirected distinctly against Miliukov. Detachments of soldiers and\\r\\nworkmen gathered in front of the headquarters of the Provisional\\r\\nGovernment, carrying banners, with inscriptions \"Down with Miliukov!\\r\\nDown with the Provisional Government!\" Miliukov appealed to the crowd\\r\\nfor confidence, and his words were greeted with hearty cheering.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Soviet Council ultimately voted confidence in the government by a\\r\\nnarrow margin of 35 in a total of 2,500. But the agitation against the\\r\\ngovernment persisted, and on May 16th Miliukov resigned. General\\r\\nKornilov, Commander of the Petrograd Garrison, and Guchkov, Minister of\\r\\nWar, finding their control of the army weakened by the interference of\\r\\nthe Soviet Council, also resigned.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe situation became critical. As a result of this agitation a new\\r\\ncoalition government was formed. Prince Lvov remained Prime Minister.\\r\\nTerestchenko became Foreign Minister. Most significant of all, Kerensky\\r\\nbecame the Minister of War. The new government issued a new declaration\\r\\nof policy, promising a firm support of the war with Germany, and an\\r\\neffort to call together at the earliest possible date a Constituent\\r\\nAssembly to deal with questions of land and of finance. This manifesto\\r\\nwas received coldly by the Soviets and their press.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was at this time that the Allies sent special missions to Russia to\\r\\naid the Russian Government in forwarding the fight against the common\\r\\nenemy. The American mission to Russia was headed by Elihu Root, former\\r\\nSecretary of State. It was cordially received, and housed in the former\\r\\nWinter Palace of the Czar. On June 15th the American Ambassador, David\\r\\nR. Francis, presented the Root mission to the Council of Ministers in\\r\\nthe Marinsky Palace, and Mr. Root made an eloquent address, declaring\\r\\nthe sympathy of the American Republic with the new Russian Democracy. He\\r\\ndeclared that the liberty of both nations was in danger. \"The armed\\r\\nforces of military autocracy are at the gates of Russia and the Allies.\\r\\nThe triumph of Germans will mean the death of liberty in Russia. No\\r\\nenemy is at the gates of America, but America has come to realize that\\r\\nthe triumph of German arms means the death of Liberty in the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Moscow Mr. Root addressed representatives of the Zemstvo and the\\r\\nlocal Council of the Workmen and Soldiers. He was warmly applauded, and\\r\\non motion of the Mayor a telegram was sent to President Wilson, thanking\\r\\nhim for sending the Root Commission to Russia. The Root Mission returned\\r\\nto the United States early in August, and reported to Washington August\\r\\n12th. At a public reception given by the citizens of New York, Senator\\r\\nRoot expressed supreme confidence in the stability of the Revolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 1st, inspired by Kerensky, and under the personal leadership of\\r\\nGeneral Kornilov, the Russian army began an offensive in Galicia. It\\r\\nfirst met with complete success, capturing Halicz, and sweeping forward\\r\\nclose to Dolina in the Carpathian foothills. Then under a very slight\\r\\nhostile German pressure, the Russian armies, immediately to the north\\r\\nand south of Kornilov\\'s army, broke and ran. This action was directly\\r\\ntraced to orders subversive of discipline, emanating from the Petrograd\\r\\nSoviet. Kornilov\\'s army was compelled to retire, and by July 21st was in\\r\\nfull retreat from Galicia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russian mutiny spread. Regiments refused to fight or to obey their\\r\\nofficers.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most picturesque episodes of this phase of the war was the\\r\\nformation of a woman\\'s regiment, known as the \"Command of Death,\" which\\r\\nwas reviewed at Petrograd June 21st, by Minister of War, Kerensky. In\\r\\nfront of the barracks assigned to this regiment a visitor found posted\\r\\nat the gate a little blue-eyed sentry in a soldier\\'s khaki blouse, short\\r\\nbreeches, green forage cap, ordinary woman\\'s black stockings and neat\\r\\nshoes. The sentry was Mareya Skridlov, daughter of Admiral Skridlov,\\r\\nformer commander of the Baltic fleet and Minister of Marines. In the\\r\\ncourtyard three hundred girls were drilling, mostly between 18 and 25\\r\\nyears old, of good physique and many of them pretty. They wore their\\r\\nhair short or had their heads entirely shaved. They were drilling under\\r\\nthe instruction of a male sergeant of the Volynsky regiment, and marched\\r\\nto an exaggerated goose step.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl commander, Lieutenant Buitchkarev, explained that most of the\\r\\nrecruits were from the higher educational academies, with a few\\r\\npeasants, factory girls and servants. Some married women were accepted,\\r\\nbut none who had children. The Battalion of Death distinguished itself\\r\\non the field, setting an example of courage to the mutinous regiments\\r\\nduring the retreat of Brusilov.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the army thus demoralized the Russian Revolution encountered a\\r\\nperilous period toward the end of July, 1917, and civil war or anarchy\\r\\nseemed almost at hand, when out of the depths of the national spirit\\r\\nthere arose a new revolution to save the situation and to maintain\\r\\norder. The country was everywhere the scene of riotous disturbances.\\r\\nAnarchists, radicals, and monarchists seemed to be working hand-in-hand\\r\\nto precipitate a reign of terror, when once more Kerensky saved the\\r\\nsituation. On July 20th, it was announced that the Premier, Prince Lvov,\\r\\nhad resigned, and that Alexander Kerensky had been appointed Premier,\\r\\nbut would also retain his portfolio as Minister of War.\\r\\n\\r\\nA new government was quickly formed. Kerensky was made practical\\r\\nDictator, and his government received the complete endorsement of a\\r\\njoint Congress of the Soviets and the Council of peasant delegates.\\r\\nKerensky acted with the utmost vigor. Orders were given to fire on\\r\\ndeserters and warrants issued for the arrest of revolutionary agitators\\r\\nwhoever they might be. Rear-Admiral Verdervski, commander of the Baltic\\r\\nfleet, was seized for communicating a secret government telegram to\\r\\nsailors\\' committees. Agitators from the Soviet were arrested, charged\\r\\nwith inciting the Peterhof troops against the Federal Government. On\\r\\nJuly 22d, the following resolution was passed by the joint Congress.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRecognizing that the country is menaced by a military debacle on the\\r\\nfront and by anarchy at home, it is resolved:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. That the country and the revolution are in danger.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. That the Provisional Government is proclaimed the Government of\\r\\n   National Safety.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. That unlimited powers are accorded the government for re-establishing\\r\\n   the organization and discipline of the army for a fight to a finish\\r\\n   against the enemies of public order, and for the realization of the\\r\\n   whole program embodied in the governmental program just announced.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reorganization of the Councils of the All-Russia, and Workmen\\'s and\\r\\nPeasants\\' Organizations on the 23d, issued a ringing address to the army\\r\\ndenouncing its mutinous spirit and warning it of the inevitable result.\\r\\nThe Provisional Government also issued a proclamation on July 22d,\\r\\ncharging that the disorders were precipitated to bring about a\\r\\ncounter-revolution by the enemies of the country. But the army was\\r\\ndemoralized. It disregarded discipline and refused to recognize military\\r\\nrule. A general retreat followed. The Germans and Austrians steadily\\r\\nadvanced through Galicia and crossed the frontier before the Russian\\r\\narmies could be forced to make a stand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe death penalty for treason or mutiny was restored in the army on July\\r\\n25th, when Kerensky threatened to resign unless this was done. On that\\r\\nsame date the government authorized the Minister of the Interior to\\r\\nsuspend the publication of periodicals that incite to insubordination or\\r\\ndisobedience to orders given by the military authorities. By July 28th\\r\\nthe situation had become more hopeful. On that day General Ruzsky,\\r\\nformerly commander-in-chief of the northern armies of Russia, and\\r\\nGeneral Gurko, ex-commander on the Russian southwestern front, were\\r\\nsummoned to Petrograd. Each had retired on account of the interference\\r\\nof the Council of Workmen and Soldiers\\' delegates. Their return to the\\r\\nservice was a hopeful sign. The Soviet also passed by an overwhelming\\r\\nmajority a resolution censuring Lenine, and demanding that he should be\\r\\npublicly tried. Charges had been made that Lenine and his associates\\r\\nwere working under German direction and financed by Germans. On August\\r\\n2d, Kornilov became Commander-in-Chief of the Russian army. A\\r\\ndisagreement in the Cabinet led to its reorganization. In the new\\r\\nCabinet appeared again representatives of the Constitutional Democratic\\r\\nparty. Conditions began to show improvement from this time forth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn extraordinary National Council met at Moscow August 26th, 1917. This\\r\\nconference consisted of 2,500 delegates representing the Duma, the\\r\\nSoviets, the Zemstvos, and indeed all organized Russia. Kerensky opened\\r\\nthe conference in a speech of great length in which he reviewed the\\r\\ngeneral situation, declaring that the destructive period of the\\r\\nRevolution had past and that the time had come to consolidate its\\r\\nconquests.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps the most important address before the Council was that made by\\r\\nGeneral Kornilov, Commander-in-Chief of the army. General Kornilov was\\r\\nreceived with prolonged cheers, which in the light of his subsequent\\r\\naction were especially significant. General Kornilov described with much\\r\\ndetail the disorganization and insubordination in the army, and\\r\\ncontinued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are implacably fighting anarchy in the army. Undoubtedly it will\\r\\nfinally be repressed, but the danger of fresh debacles is weighing\\r\\nconstantly on the country. The situation on the front is bad. We have\\r\\nlost the whole of Galicia, the whole of Bukowina, and all the fruits of\\r\\nour recent victories. If Russia wishes to be saved the army must be\\r\\nregenerated at any cost.\" General Kornilov then outlined the most\\r\\nimportant of the reform measures which he recommended, and concluded: \"I\\r\\nbelieve that the genius and the reason of the Russian people will save\\r\\nthe country. I believe in a brilliant future for our army. I believe its\\r\\nancient glory will be restored.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Kaledines, leader of the Don Cossacks, mounted the tribune and\\r\\nread a resolution passed by the Cossacks demanding the continuation of\\r\\nthe war until complete victory was attained. He defied the extreme\\r\\nRadicals. \"Who saved you from the Bolsheviki on the 14th of July?\" he\\r\\nasked contemptuously. \"We Cossacks have been free men. We are not made\\r\\ndrunk by our new-found liberties and are unblinded by party or program.\\r\\nWe tell you plainly and categorically, \\'Remove yourselves from the place\\r\\nwhich you have neither the ability or the courage to fill, and let\\r\\nbetter men than yourselves step in, or take the consequences of your\\r\\nfolly.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conference took no definite action, being invested with no\\r\\nauthority, but it served to bring out clearly the line of cleavage\\r\\nbetween the Radical or Socialistic element represented by Kerensky and\\r\\nthe Conservatives represented by the generals of the army.\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately on the heels of the Moscow conference an important German\\r\\nadvance was made in the direction of Riga, the most important Russian\\r\\nBaltic port. In spite of a vigorous defense the Germans captured the\\r\\ncity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe loss of Riga intensified the political excitement in Russia, and\\r\\nproduced a profound crisis. A wave of unrest spread throughout the\\r\\ncountry. The Grand Duke Michael, and the Grand Duke Paul with their\\r\\nfamilies, were arrested on a charge of conspiracy. The Provisional\\r\\nGovernment was charged with responsibility of the collapse of the army.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was on September 9th, that the storm broke, and General Kornilov, the\\r\\nCommander-in-Chief of the Russian armies, raised the flag of revolt\\r\\nagainst the Provisional Government. The details of the revolt are as\\r\\nfollows:\\r\\n\\r\\nAt one o\\'clock Saturday afternoon, Deputy Lvov, of the Duma, called upon\\r\\nPremier Kerensky, and declared that he had come as the representative of\\r\\nGeneral Kornilov to demand the surrender of all power into Kornilov\\'s\\r\\nhands. M. Lvov said that this demand did not emanate from Kornilov only\\r\\nbut was supported by an organization of Duma members, Moscow industrial\\r\\ninterests, and other conservatives. This group, said M. Lvov, did not\\r\\nobject to Kerensky personally, but demanded that he transfer the\\r\\nPortfolio of War to M. Savinkov, assistant Minister of War, who all\\r\\nalong had supported Kornilov.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you agree,\" M. Lvov added, \"we invite you to come to headquarters\\r\\nand meet General Kornilov, giving you a solemn guarantee that you will\\r\\nnot be arrested.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPremier Kerensky replied that he could not believe Kornilov to be guilty\\r\\nof such an act of treason, and that he would communicate with him\\r\\ndirectly. In an exchange of telegrams Kornilov confirmed fully to the\\r\\nPremier his demands. Kerensky promptly placed Lvov under arrest,\\r\\ndenounced Kornilov as a traitor and deposed him from his position as\\r\\nCommander-in-Chief, General Klembovsky being appointed in his place.\\r\\nGeneral Kornilov responded to the order of dismissal by moving an army\\r\\nagainst the Capital.\\r\\n\\r\\nMartial law was declared in Moscow and in Petrograd. Kerensky assumed\\r\\nthe functions of Commander-in-Chief and took military measures to defend\\r\\nPetrograd and resist the rebels. On the 12th it was clear that the\\r\\nKornilov revolt had failed to receive the expected support. Kornilov\\r\\nadvanced toward Petrograd, and occupied Jotchina, thirty miles southwest\\r\\nof the Capital, but there was no bloodshed. On the night of the 13th,\\r\\nGeneral Alexief demanded Kornilov\\'s unconditional surrender, and the\\r\\nrevolt collapsed. Kornilov was arrested and the Provisional Government\\r\\nreconstituted on stronger lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the so-called Kornilov revolt, the Russian Revolution assumed a\\r\\nform which might almost be called stable. A democratic congress met at\\r\\nMoscow, September 27th, and adopted a resolution providing for a\\r\\npreliminary parliament to consist of 231 members, of whom 110 were to\\r\\nrepresent the Zemstvos and the towns. The congress refused its sanction\\r\\nto a coalition cabinet in which the Constitutional Democrats should\\r\\nparticipate, but Kerensky practically defied the congress, and named a\\r\\ncoalition cabinet, in which several portfolios were held by members of\\r\\nthe Constitutional Democratic Party. The new government issued a\\r\\nstatement declaring that it had three principal aims: to raise the\\r\\nfighting power of the army and navy; to bring order to the country by\\r\\nfighting anarchy; to call the Constituent Assembly as soon as possible.\\r\\nThe Constituent Assembly was called to assemble in December. It was to\\r\\nconsist of 732 delegates to be elected by popular vote.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime agitation against the Coalition Government continued. On\\r\\nNovember 1st, the Premier issued a statement through the Associated\\r\\nPress, to all the newspapers of the Entente, which conveyed the\\r\\ninformation that he almost despaired of restoring civil law in the\\r\\ndistracted country. He said that he felt that help was needed urgently\\r\\nand that Russia asked it as her right. \"Russia has fought consistently\\r\\nsince the beginning,\" he said. \"She saved France and England from\\r\\ndisaster early in the war. She is worn out by the strain and claims as\\r\\nher right that the Allies now shoulder the burden.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 7th, an armed insurrection against the Coalition Government\\r\\nand Premier Kerensky was precipitated by the Bolsheviki faction. The\\r\\nrevolt was headed by Leon Trotzky, President of the Central Executive\\r\\nCommittee of the Petrograd Council, with Nicholas Lenine, the Bolsheviki\\r\\nleader. The Revolutionists seized the offices of the telephone and\\r\\ntelegraph companies and occupied the state bank and the Marie Palace\\r\\nwhere the preliminary Parliament had been sitting. The garrison at\\r\\nPetrograd espoused the cause of the Bolsheviki and complete control was\\r\\nseized with comparatively little fighting. The government troops were\\r\\nquickly overpowered, except at the Winter Palace, whose chief guardians\\r\\nwere the Woman\\'s Battalion, and the Military Cadets. The Woman\\'s\\r\\nBattalion fought bravely, and suffered terribly, and with the Military\\r\\nCadets who also remained true, held the Palace for several hours. The\\r\\nBolsheviki brought up armored cars and the cruiser Aurora, and turned\\r\\nthe guns of the Fortress of SS. Peter and Paul upon the Palace before\\r\\nits defenders would surrender.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat evening the Revolutionary Committee issued a characteristic\\r\\nproclamation, denouncing the government of Kerensky as opposed to the\\r\\ngovernment and the people, and calling upon the soldiers in the army to\\r\\narrest their officers if they did not at once join the Revolution. They\\r\\nannounced the following program:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst: The offer of an immediate democratic peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond: The immediate handing over of large proportional lands to the\\r\\npeasants.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird: The transmission of all authority to the Council of Workmen\\'s and\\r\\nSoldiers\\' Delegates.\\r\\n\\r\\nFourth: The honest convocation of the Constituent Assembly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a meeting of the Council, Trotzky declared that the government no\\r\\nlonger existed, and introduced Lenine as an old comrade whom he welcomed\\r\\nback. Lenine was received with prolonged cheers, and said: \"Now we have\\r\\na Revolution. The peasants and workmen control the government. This is\\r\\nonly a preliminary step toward a similar revolution everywhere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nProclamation after proclamation came from the new government. In one of\\r\\nthem it was stated \"M. Kerensky has taken flight, and all military\\r\\nbodies have been empowered to take all possible measures to arrest\\r\\nKerensky and bring him back to Petrograd. All complicity with Kerensky\\r\\nwill be dealt with as high treason.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA Bolsheviki Cabinet was named. The Premier was Nicholas Lenine; the\\r\\nForeign Minister, Leon Trotzky. The other Cabinet members were all\\r\\nBolsheviki, including Bibenko, a Kronstadt sailor, of the Committee on\\r\\nWar and Marine, and Shliapnikov, a laborer, who was Minister of Labor.\\r\\nLenine\\'s personality has already been described. Trotzky, the chief aid\\r\\nof Lenine\\'s rebellion, had been living in New York City three months\\r\\nbefore the Czar was overthrown, but he had previously been expelled from\\r\\nGermany, France, Switzerland and Spain. His real name was Leber\\r\\nBraunstein, and he was born in the Russian Government of Kherson, near\\r\\nthe Black Sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the insurrection occurred, Kerensky succeeded in escaping from\\r\\nPetrograd, and persuaded about two thousand Cossacks, several hundred\\r\\nMilitary Cadets, and a contingent of Artillery, to fight under his\\r\\nbanner. He advanced toward Petrograd, but his forces were greatly\\r\\noutnumbered by the Bolsheviki. At Tsarskoe-Selo a battle took place, the\\r\\nKerensky troops met defeat, and its leader saved himself by flight.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Moscow the entire city passed into the control of the Bolsheviki but\\r\\nnot without severe fighting in which more than three thousand people\\r\\nwere slain. On the collapse of the Kerensky government conditions\\r\\nthroughout Russia became chaotic. Ukraine declared its independence, and\\r\\nFinland also severed its connection with Russia. General Kaledines\\r\\ndeclared against the Bolsheviki, and organized an army to save the\\r\\ncountry. Siberia, Bessarabia, Lithuania, the Caucasus and other\\r\\ndistricts declared their complete independence of the Central\\r\\nGovernment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bolsheviki, in control at Petrograd, opened negotiations with the\\r\\nCentral Powers for an armistice along the entire front from the Baltic\\r\\nto Asia Minor, and on December 17th, such an armistice went into effect.\\r\\nMeanwhile they began negotiations for a treaty of peace. General\\r\\nDukholin, the Commander-in-Chief, on November 20th, was ordered by\\r\\nLenine to propose the armistice. To this request he made no reply, and\\r\\non November 21st, he was deposed and Ensign Krylenko was appointed the\\r\\nnew Commander-in-Chief. General Dukholin was subsequently murdered, by\\r\\nbeing thrown from a train after the Bolsheviki seized the general\\r\\nheadquarters.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrotzky sent a note to the representatives of neutral powers in\\r\\nPetrograd, informing them of his proposal for an armistice, and stating\\r\\n\"The consummation of an immediate peace is demanded in all countries,\\r\\nboth belligerent and neutral. The Russian Government counts on the firm\\r\\nsupport of workmen in all countries in this struggle for peace.\" Lenine,\\r\\nhowever, declared that Russia did not contemplate a separate peace with\\r\\nGermany, and that the Russian Government, before agreeing to an\\r\\narmistice, would communicate with the Allies and make a certain proposal\\r\\nto the imperialistic governments of France and England, rejection of\\r\\nwhich would place them in open opposition to the wishes of their own\\r\\npeople.\\r\\n\\r\\nA period of turmoil followed. In the meantime elections for the\\r\\nConstituent Assembly were held. The result in Petrograd was announced as\\r\\n272,000 votes for the Bolsheviki, 211,000 for the Constitutional\\r\\nDemocrats, and 116,000 for the Social Revolutionaries, showing that the\\r\\nBolsheviki failed to attain a majority. Notwithstanding the prevailing\\r\\nchaos, the Lenine-Trotzky Government persisted in negotiations for an\\r\\narmistice, and it was arranged that the first conference be held at the\\r\\nGerman headquarters at Brest-Litovsk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russian delegates were Kamenev, whose real name was Rosenfelt, a\\r\\nwell known Bolshevist leader; Sokolnikov, a sailor; Bithenko, a soldier,\\r\\nand Mstislasky, who had formerly been librarian to the General Staff,\\r\\nbut who was now a strong Socialist. Representatives were present of\\r\\nGermany, Austria-Hungary, Turkey and Bulgaria.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter many interchanges of opinion a suspension of hostilities for ten\\r\\ndays was authorized, to be utilized in bringing to a conclusion\\r\\nnegotiations for an armistice. On December 7th it was announced from\\r\\nPetrograd that for the first time since the war not a shot was fired on\\r\\nthe Russian front. Foreign Secretary Trotzky, on the 6th of December,\\r\\nnotified the allied embassies in Petrograd of these negotiations and\\r\\nadded that the armistice would be signed only on condition that the\\r\\ntroops should not be transferred from one front to another. He announced\\r\\nthat negotiations had been suspended to afford the Allied Governments\\r\\nopportunity to define their attitude toward the peace negotiation; that\\r\\nis, their willingness or refusal to participate in negotiations for an\\r\\narmistice and peace. In case of refusal they must declare clearly and\\r\\ndefinitely before all mankind the aims for which the peoples of Europe\\r\\nhad been called to shed their blood during the fourth year of the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo official replies were made to this note. On December 7th, Generals\\r\\nKaledines and Kornilov raised the standard of revolt, but reports\\r\\nindicated that the Bolsheviki were extending their control over all\\r\\nRussia. A meeting of the Constituent Assembly took place on December\\r\\n11th. Less than 50 of the 600 delegates attended. Meanwhile the\\r\\nnegotiations for an armistice continued. On December 16th an agreement\\r\\nwas reached and an armistice signed, to continue from December 17th to\\r\\nJanuary 14th, 1918.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map: All of Europe and Asia, showing the Trans-Siberian\\r\\nRailway and other railroads.]\\r\\n  RUSSIA\\'S GREAT RAILWAY LINK BETWEEN VLADIVOSTOK AND THE ARCTIC OCEAN\\r\\n  The Czecho-Slovaks took possession of long stretches of the\\r\\n  Trans-Siberian Railroad. Japan lent her aid in the east, and American\\r\\n  and Allied troops swept down from the Murman coast in the northwest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the first month in which the Bolsheviki conducted the government\\r\\nnumerous edicts of a revolutionary character were issued. Class titles,\\r\\ndistinctions and privileges were abolished; the corporate property of\\r\\nnobles, merchants and burgesses was to be handed over to the state, as\\r\\nwas all church property, lands, money and precious stones; and religious\\r\\ninstruction was to cease in the schools. Strikes were in progress\\r\\neverywhere, and disorder was rampant.\\r\\n\\r\\nKornilov, Terestchenko and other associates of Kerensky, were imprisoned\\r\\nin the Fortress of SS. Peter and Paul; the Cadet Party was outlawed by\\r\\ndecree and the houses of its leaders raided. On January 8, 1918, it was\\r\\nannounced that the Bolsheviki had determined that all loans and Treasury\\r\\nbonds held by foreign subjects, abroad or in Russia, were repudiated.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this period the Bolsheviki\\'s Foreign Secretary astonished the\\r\\nworld by making public the secret treaties between Russia and foreign\\r\\ngovernments in the early years of the war. These treaties dealt with the\\r\\nproposed annexation by Russia of the Dardanelles, Constantinople and\\r\\ncertain areas in Asia Minor; with the French claim on Alsace-Lorraine\\r\\nand the left bank of the Rhine; with offers to Greece, for the purpose\\r\\nof inducing her to assist Serbia; with plans to alter her Western\\r\\nboundaries, with the British and Russian control of Persia; and with\\r\\nItaly\\'s desire to annex certain Austrian territories. These treaties had\\r\\nbeen seized upon the Bolsheviki assumption of power, and were now\\r\\nrepudiated by the new government.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the period of the armistice Lenine began his move for a separate\\r\\npeace, in spite of the formal protests of the Allied representatives at\\r\\nPetrograd.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first sitting took place on Saturday, December 22, 1917. Among the\\r\\ndelegates were Dr. Richard von Kuhlmann, Foreign Minister, and General\\r\\nHoffman, of Germany; Count Czernin, Foreign Minister of Austria-Hungary;\\r\\nMinister Kopov, of Bulgaria; Nesimy Bey, former Foreign Minister of\\r\\nTurkey, and a large delegation from Russia, composed of Bolshevist\\r\\nleaders. Dr. von Kuhlmann was chosen as the presiding officer and made\\r\\nthe opening speech. The Russian peace demands and the German\\r\\ncounter-proposals were then read, and considered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German proposals proved unacceptable to Russia, and a second session\\r\\nof the peace conference was held at Brest-Litovsk on January 10, 1918.\\r\\nTrotzky himself attended this meeting as one of the representatives from\\r\\nRussia, and there was also a representative from Ukraine, which had\\r\\ndeclared its independence, and was allowed to join the conference.\\r\\nGeneral Hoffman protested strongly against the Russian endeavor to make\\r\\nappeals of a revolutionary character to the German troops.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map: Europe and Eastern Asia.]\\r\\n  RUSSIA AS PARTITIONED BY THE BREST-LITOVSK TREATY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe armistice having expired, it was agreed it should be continued to\\r\\nFebruary 12th. After a long and acrimonious debate the Conference broke\\r\\nup in a clash over the evacuation of the Russian provinces. On January\\r\\n24th it was announced that the Russian delegates to the peace conference\\r\\nhad unanimously decided to reject the German terms. They stated that\\r\\nwhen they asked Germany\\'s final terms General Hoffman of the German\\r\\ndelegation had replied by opening a map and pointing out a line from the\\r\\nshores of the Gulf of Finland to the east of the Moon Sound Islands, to\\r\\nValk, to the west of Minsk, to Brest-Litovsk, thus eliminating Courland\\r\\nand all the Baltic provinces.\\r\\n\\r\\nAsked the terms of the Central Powers in regard to the territory south\\r\\nof Brest-Litovsk General Hoffman replied that was a question which they\\r\\nwould discuss only with Ukraine. M. Kaminev asked: \"Supposing we do not\\r\\nagree to such condition, what are you going to do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Hoffman\\'s answer was, \"Within a week we would occupy Reval.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 27th, Trotzky made his report to the Soviets at Petrograd.\\r\\nAfter a thorough explanation of the peace debates, he declared that the\\r\\nGovernment of the Soviets could not sign such a peace. It was then\\r\\ndecided to demobilize the Russian army and withdraw from the war.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map]\\r\\n  GENERAL MAP OF THE BALTIC SEA\\r\\n  With the collapse of Russia German forces advanced from Riga, along\\r\\n  the Gulf of Finland occupying Reval and threatening Petrograd.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinal sessions of the peace congress were resumed at Brest-Litovsk\\r\\nJanuary 29th; a peace treaty was made between the Central Powers and the\\r\\nUkraine, and the Bolsheviki yielded to the German demands without\\r\\nsigning a treaty. Meanwhile the Russian Constituent Assembly which met\\r\\nat Petrograd on January 19th, was dissolved on January 20th, by the\\r\\nBolsheviki Council.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisorders continued throughout all Russia and counter-revolutionary\\r\\nmovements were started at many places. On February 18th, the day when\\r\\nthe armistice agreement between Russia and the Central Powers expired,\\r\\nGerman forces began a new invasion of Russia. The next day the\\r\\nBolshevist Government issued a statement, announcing that Russia would\\r\\nbe compelled to sign a peace. The German advance went on rapidly, and\\r\\nmany important Russian cities were occupied. On February 24th, the\\r\\nBolshevist Government announced that peace terms had been accepted, and\\r\\na treaty was signed at Brest-Litovsk on March 3d.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 14th the All-Russia Council of Soviets voted to ratify the\\r\\ntreaty, after an all-night sitting. Lenine pronounced himself in favor\\r\\nof accepting the German terms; Trotzky stood for war, but did not attend\\r\\nthe meetings of the Council. Lenine defended the step by pointing out\\r\\nthat the country was completely unable to offer resistance, and that\\r\\npeace was indispensable for the completion of the social war in Russia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new treaty dispossessed Russia of territories amounting to nearly\\r\\none-quarter of the area of European Russia, and inhabited by one-third\\r\\nof Russia\\'s total population. Trotzky resigned on account of his\\r\\nopposition to the treaty and was succeeded by M. Tchitcherin. He became\\r\\nChairman of the Petrograd Labor Commune. The treaty between Russia and\\r\\nthe Central Powers was formally denounced by the Premiers and Foreign\\r\\nMinisters of Great Britain, France, and Italy, and was not recognized by\\r\\nthe Allied nations.\\r\\n\\r\\nA final revocation of its provisions by both sides did not put an end to\\r\\nthe military operations of the Central Powers in Russia, nor did the\\r\\nRussians cease to make feeble and sporadic attempts at resistance.\\r\\nGermany was forced to keep large bodies of troops along the Russian\\r\\nfront, but formally Russia\\'s part in the war had come to an end.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph]\\r\\n  THREE MESSENGERS OF DESTRUCTION FOR TRIESTE\\r\\n  This remarkable photograph was taken from one French aeroplane just as\\r\\n  another had released three aerial torpedoes in a combined bombing and\\r\\n  observation raid on Trieste, the great Austrian naval base.

V. Buck, Washington. D. C.\\r\\n  THE CARGO SUBMARINE \"DEUTSCHLAND\"\\r\\n  Shortly before the United States entered the war, Germany sent over a\\r\\n  merchant submarine with a cargo of dye stuffs and drugs, an implied\\r\\n  threat which was later realized in the U-boat attacks on the American\\r\\n  coast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXII\\r\\n\\r\\nGERMANY\\'S OBJECT LESSON TO THE UNITED STATES.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the first two years of the war many Americans, especially those\\r\\nin the West, observed the great events which were happening with great\\r\\ninterest, no doubt, but with a feeling of detachment. The war was a long\\r\\nway off. The Atlantic Ocean separated Europe from America, and it seemed\\r\\nalmost absurd to think that the Great War could ever affect us.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the year 1916, however, two events happened which seemed to bring the\\r\\nwar to our door. The first was the arrival at Baltimore, on July 9th, of\\r\\nthe Deutschland, a German submarine of great size, built entirely for\\r\\ncommercial purposes, and the second was the appearance, on the 7th of\\r\\nOctober, of a German war submarine in the harbor at Newport, Rhode\\r\\nIsland, and its exploit on the following day when it sunk a number of\\r\\nBritish and neutral vessels just outside the three-mile line on the\\r\\nAtlantic coast.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe performances of these two vessels were equally suggestive, but the\\r\\npopular feeling with regard to what they had done was very divergent.\\r\\nThe voyage of the Deutschland roused the widest admiration but the\\r\\naction of the U-53 stirred up the deepest indignation. Yet the voyages\\r\\nof each showed with equal clearness that, however much America might\\r\\nconsider herself separated from the Great War, the new scientific\\r\\ninvention, the submarine, had annihilated space, and America, too, was\\r\\nnow but a neighbor of the nations at war.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe voyage of the Deutschland was a romance in itself. It was commanded\\r\\nby Captain Paul Koenig, a German officer of the old school. He had been\\r\\ncaptain of the Schleswig of the North German Lloyd, and of other big\\r\\nliners. When the power of the British fleet drove German commerce from\\r\\nthe seas, he had found himself without a job, and, as he phrased it,\\r\\n\"was drifting about the country like a derelict.\" One day, in September,\\r\\n1915, he was asked to meet Herr Alfred Lohmann, an agent of the North\\r\\nGerman Lloyd Line, and surprised by an offer to navigate a submarine\\r\\ncargo ship from Germany to America. Captain Koenig, who seems to have\\r\\nbeen in every way an admirable personage, at once consented. He has told\\r\\nus the story of his trip in his interesting book called \"The Voyage of\\r\\nthe Deutschland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Deutschland itself was three hundred feet long, thirty feet wide,\\r\\nand carried one thousand tons of cargo and a crew of twenty-nine men. It\\r\\ncost a half a million dollars, but paid for itself in the first trip.\\r\\nAccording to Captain Koenig the voyage on the whole seems to have been\\r\\nmost enjoyable. He understood his boat well and had watched its\\r\\nconstruction. Before setting out on his voyage he carefully trained his\\r\\ncrew, and experimented with the Deutschland until he was thoroughly\\r\\nfamiliar with all its peculiarities. The cargo was composed of dye\\r\\nstuffs, and the ship was well supplied with provisions and comforts. In\\r\\nhis description of the trip he lays most emphasis upon the discomfort\\r\\nresulting from heavy weather and from storms. He was able to avoid all\\r\\ndanger from hostile ships by the very simple process of diving. No\\r\\nEnglish ship approached him closely as he was always able to see them\\r\\nfrom a distance, usually observing their course by means of their smoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of his liveliest adventures, however, occurred when attempting to\\r\\nsubmerge suddenly during a heavy sea on the appearance of a destroyer.\\r\\nThe destroyer apparently never observed the Deutschland, but in the\\r\\nendeavor to dive quickly the submarine practically stood on its head,\\r\\nand dived down into the mud, where it found itself held fast. Captain\\r\\nKoenig however was equal to the emergency, and by balancing and trimming\\r\\nthe tanks he finally restored the center of gravity and released his\\r\\nboat.\\r\\n\\r\\nA considerable portion of his trip was passed upon the surface as he\\r\\nonly submerged when there was suspicion of danger. According to his\\r\\nstory his men kept always in the highest spirits. They had plenty of\\r\\nmusic, and doubtless appreciated the extraordinary nature of their\\r\\nvoyage.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn amusing incident during the trip was the attempt to camouflage his\\r\\nship by a frame work, made of canvas and so constructed as to give the\\r\\noutline of a steamer. One day a hostile steamer appeared in the distance\\r\\nand Captain Koenig proceeded to test his disguise.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter great difficulties, especially in connection with the production\\r\\nof smoke, he finally had the whole construction fairly at work. The\\r\\nsteamer, which had been peacefully going its way, on seeing the new ship\\r\\nsuddenly changed her course and steered directly toward the Deutschland.\\r\\nIt evidently took the Deutschland for some kind of a wreck and was\\r\\nhurrying to give it assistance. Captain Koenig at once pulled off his\\r\\nsuper-structure and revealed himself as a submarine, and the strange\\r\\nvessel veered about and hurried off as fast as it could.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the arrival of the Deutschland in America Captain Koenig and his crew\\r\\nfound their difficulties over. All arrangements had been made by\\r\\nrepresentatives of the North German Lloyd for their safety and comfort.\\r\\nAs they ran up Chesapeake Bay they were greeted by the whistles of the\\r\\nneutral steamers that they passed. The moving-picture companies\\r\\nimmortalized the crew and they were treated with the utmost hospitality.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Allied governments protested that the Deutschland was really a war\\r\\nvessel and on the 12th of July a commission of three American naval\\r\\nofficers was sent down from Washington to make an investigation. The\\r\\ninvestigation showed the Deutschland was absolutely unarmed and the\\r\\nAmerican Government decided not to interfere.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe position of the Allies was that a submarine, even though without\\r\\nguns or torpedoes, was practically a vessel of war from its very nature,\\r\\nand for it to pretend to be a merchant vessel was as if some great\\r\\nGerman man-of-war should dismount its guns and pass them over to some\\r\\ntender and then undertake to visit an American port. They argued that if\\r\\nthe submarine would come out from harbor it might be easily fitted with\\r\\ndetachable torpedo tubes, and become as dangerous as any U-boat. Even\\r\\nwithout arms it might easily sink an unarmed merchant vessel by ramming.\\r\\nBut the United States was not convinced, and American citizens rather\\r\\nadmired the genial captain.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis return was almost as uneventful as his voyage out. At the very\\r\\nbeginning he had trouble in not being able to rise after an experimental\\r\\ndive. This misadventure was caused by a plug of mud which had stopped up\\r\\nthe opening of the manometer. But the difficulty was overcome, and he\\r\\nwas able to pass under water between the British ships which were on the\\r\\nlookout. His return home was a triumph. Hundreds of thousands of people\\r\\ngathered along the banks of the Weser, filled with the greatest\\r\\nenthusiasm. Poems were written in his honor and his appearance was\\r\\neverywhere greeted with enthusiastic applause. The Germans felt sure\\r\\nthat through the Deutschland and similar boats they had broken the\\r\\nBritish blockade.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Koenig made a second voyage, landing at New London, Connecticut,\\r\\non November 1st, where he took on a cargo of rubber, nickel and other\\r\\nvaluable commodities. On November 16th, in attempting to get away to\\r\\nsea, he met with a collision with the tug T. A. Scott, Jr., and had to\\r\\nreturn to New London for repairs. He concluded his voyage, however,\\r\\nwithout difficulty. In spite of his success the Germans did not make any\\r\\nvery great attempt to develop a fleet of submarine cargo boats.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other German act which brought home to Americans the possibilities\\r\\nof the submarine, the visit of the U-53, was a very different sort of\\r\\nmatter. U-53 was a German submarine of the largest type. On October 7,\\r\\n1916, it made a sudden appearance at Newport, and its captain,\\r\\nLieutenant-Captain Hans Rose, was entertained as if he were a welcome\\r\\nguest. He sent a letter to the German Ambassador at Washington and\\r\\nreceived visitors in his beautiful boat. The U-53 was a war submarine,\\r\\ntwo hundred and thirteen feet long, with two deck guns and four torpedo\\r\\ntubes. It had been engaged in the war against Allied commerce in the\\r\\nMediterranean. Captain Rose paid formal visits to Rear-Admiral Austin\\r\\nKnight, Commander of the United States Second Naval District, stationed\\r\\nat Newport, and Rear-Admiral Albert Gleaves, Commander of the American\\r\\ndestroyer flotilla at that place, and then set out secretly to his\\r\\ndestination.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the next day the news came in that the U-53 had sunk five merchant\\r\\nvessels. These were the Strathdene, which was torpedoed; the West Point,\\r\\na British freighter, also torpedoed; the Stephano, a passenger liner\\r\\nbetween New York and Halifax, which the submarine attempted to sink by\\r\\nopening its sea valves but was finally torpedoed; the Blommersdijk, a\\r\\nDutch freighter, and the Christian Knudsen, a Norwegian boat. The\\r\\nAmerican steamer Kansan was also stopped, but allowed to proceed. When\\r\\nthe submarine began its work wireless signals soon told what was\\r\\nhappening, and Admiral Knight, with the Newport destroyer flotilla,\\r\\nhurried to the rescue. These destroyers picked up two hundred and\\r\\nsixteen men and acted with such promptness that not a single life was\\r\\nlost.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe action of the U-53 produced intense excitement in America. The\\r\\nnewspapers were filled with editorial denunciation, and the people were\\r\\nroused to indignation. The American Government apparently took the\\r\\nground that the Germans were acting according to law and according to\\r\\ntheir promise to America. They had given warning in each case and\\r\\nallowed the crews of the vessels which they sunk to take to their boats.\\r\\nThis was believed to be a fulfilment of their pledge \"not to sink\\r\\nmerchant vessels without warning and without saving human lives, unless\\r\\nthe ship attempts to escape or offers resistance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general feeling, however, of American public opinion was that it was\\r\\na brutal act. In the case of the Stephano there were ninety-four\\r\\npassengers. These, together with the crew, were placed adrift in boats\\r\\nat eight o\\'clock in the evening, in a rough sea sixty miles away from\\r\\nthe nearest land. If the American destroyer fleet had not rushed to the\\r\\nrescue it is extremely likely that a great many of these boats would\\r\\nnever have reached land. The German Government did not save these human\\r\\nlives. It was the American navy which did that. But, technicalities\\r\\naside, the pride of the American people was wounded. They could not\\r\\ntolerate a situation in which American men-of-war should stand idly by\\r\\nand watch a submarine in a leisurely manner sink ships engaged in\\r\\nAmerican trade whose passengers and crews contained many American\\r\\ncitizens.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was another one of those foolish things that Germans were constantly\\r\\ndoing, which gave them no appreciable military advantage, but stirred up\\r\\nagainst them the sentiment of the world. The Germans perhaps were\\r\\nanxious to show the power of the submarines, and to give America an\\r\\nobject lesson in that power. They wished to make plain that they could\\r\\ndestroy overseas trade, and that if the United States should endeavor to\\r\\nsend troops across the water they would be able to sink those troops.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Germans probably never seriously contemplated a blockade of the\\r\\nAmerican coast. The U-53 returned to its base and the danger was ended.\\r\\nAmerican commerce went peacefully on, and the net result of the German\\r\\naudacity was in the increase of bitterness in the popular feeling toward\\r\\nthe German methods.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXIII\\r\\n\\r\\nAMERICA TRANSFORMED BY WAR\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Germany threw down the gauge of battle to the civilized world, the\\r\\nGerman High Command calculated that the long, rigorous and thorough\\r\\nmilitary training to which every male German had submitted, would make a\\r\\nmilitary force invincible in the field. The High Command believed that a\\r\\nnation so trained would carve out victory after victory and would end\\r\\nthe World War before any nation could train its men sufficiently to\\r\\ncheck the Teutonic rush.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo that theory was opposed the democratic conception that the free\\r\\nnations of earth could train their young men intensively for six months\\r\\nand send these vigorous free men into the field to win the final\\r\\ndecision over the hosts of autocracy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese antagonistic theories were tried out to a finish in the World War\\r\\nand the theory of democracy, developed in the training camps of America,\\r\\nCanada, Australia, Britain, France and Italy, triumphed. Especially in\\r\\nthe training camps of America was the German theory disproved. There\\r\\nwithin six months the best fighting troops on earth were developed and\\r\\ntrained in the most modern of war-time practices. Everything that\\r\\nGermany could devise found its answer in American ingenuity, American\\r\\nendurance and American skill.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entrance of America into the tremendous conflict on April 6, 1917\\r\\nwas followed immediately by the mobilization of the entire nation.\\r\\nBusiness and industry of every character were represented in the Council\\r\\nof National Defense which acted as a great central functioning\\r\\norganization for all industries and agencies connected with the\\r\\nprosecution of the war. Executives of rare talent commanding high\\r\\nsalaries tendered their services freely to the government. These were\\r\\nthe \"dollar a year men\" whose productive genius was to bear fruit in the\\r\\nclothing, arming, provisioning, munitioning and transportation of four\\r\\nmillion men and the conquest of Germany by a veritable avalanche of war\\r\\nmaterial.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of the ranks of business and science came Hurley, Schwab, Piez,\\r\\nCoonley to drive forward a record-breaking shipbuilding program,\\r\\nStettinius to speed up the manufacture of munitions, John W. Ryan to\\r\\ncoordinate and accelerate the manufacture of airplanes, Vance C.\\r\\nMcCormick and Dr. Alonzo E. Taylor to solve the problems of the War\\r\\nTrade Board, Hoover to multiply food production, to conserve food\\r\\nsupplies and to place the army and citizenry of America upon food\\r\\nrations while maintaining the morale of the Allies through scientific\\r\\nfood distribution and a host of other patriotic civilians who put the\\r\\nresources of the nation behind the military and naval forces opposed to\\r\\nGermany. Every available loom was put at work to make cloth for the army\\r\\nand the navy, the leather market was drained of its supplies to shoe our\\r\\nforces with wear adapted to the drastic requirements of modern warfare.\\r\\n\\r\\nGerman capital invested in American plants was placed under the\\r\\njurisdiction of A. Mitchell Palmer as Alien Property Custodian. German\\r\\nships were seized and transformed into American transports. Physicians\\r\\nover military age set a glorious example of patriotic devotion by their\\r\\nenlistment in thousands. Lawyers and citizens generally in the same\\r\\ncategory as to age entered the office of the Judge Advocate General or\\r\\nthe ranks of the Four Minute Men or the American Protective League which\\r\\nrendered great service to the country in exposing German propaganda and\\r\\nin placing would-be slackers in military service. Bankers led the mighty\\r\\nLiberty Loan and War Savings Stamp drives and unselfishly placed the\\r\\nresources of their institutions at the service of the government.\\r\\n\\r\\nWomen and children rallied to the flag with an intensity of purpose,\\r\\nsacrifice and effort that demonstrated how completely was the heart of\\r\\nAmerica in the war. Work in shops, fields, hospitals, Red Cross work\\r\\nrooms and elsewhere was cheerfully and enthusiastically performed and\\r\\nthe sacrifices of food rationing, higher prices, lightless nights,\\r\\ngasolineless Sundays, diminished steam railway and trolley service were\\r\\naccepted with a multitude of minor inconvenience without a murmur.\\r\\nCongress had a free hand in making appropriations. The country approved\\r\\nwithout a minute\\'s hesitation bills for taxation that in other days\\r\\nwould have brought ruin to the political party proposing them. Billions\\r\\nwere voted to departments where hundreds of thousands had been the rule.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map of the United States]\\r\\n  THE UNITED STATES AN ARMED CAMP\\r\\n  The map shows the location of the camps where the National Army and\\r\\n  the National Guard were trained for war. Afterwards the entire forces\\r\\n  were known as the United States Army\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe true temper of the American people was carefully hidden from the\\r\\nGerman people by the German newspapers acting under instructions from\\r\\nthe Imperial Government. Instead of the truth, false reports were\\r\\nprinted in the newspapers of Berlin and elsewhere that the passage of\\r\\nthe American conscription law had been followed by rioting and rebellion\\r\\nin many places and that fully fifty per cent of the American people was\\r\\nopposed to the declaration of war. The fact that the selective service\\r\\nact passed in May, 1917, was accepted by everybody in this country as a\\r\\nwholly equitable and satisfactory law did not permeate into Germany\\r\\nuntil the first American Expeditionary Force had actually landed in\\r\\nFrance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerica\\'s fighting power was demonstrated conclusively to the Germanic\\r\\nintellect at Seicheprey, Bouresches Wood, Belleau Wood, Chateau-Thierry,\\r\\nand in the Forest of the Argonne. Especially was it demonstrated when it\\r\\ncame to fighting in small units, or in individual fighting. The highly\\r\\ndisciplined and highly trained German soldiers were absolutely unfitted\\r\\nto cope with Americans, Canadians and Australians when it came to\\r\\nmatching individual against individual, or small group against small\\r\\ngroup.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was shown in the wild reaches of the Forest of the Argonne. There\\r\\nthe machine-gun nests of the Germans were isolated and demolished\\r\\nspeedily. Small parties of Germans were stalked and run down by the\\r\\nrelentless Americans. On the other hand, the Germans could make no\\r\\nheadway against the American troops operating in the Forest. The famous\\r\\n\"Lost Battalion\" of the 308th United States Infantry penetrated so far\\r\\nin advance of its supports that it was cut off for four days without\\r\\nfood, water or supplies of munitions in the Argonne. The enemy had cut\\r\\nits line of communication and was enforced both in front and in the\\r\\nrear. Yet the lost battalion, comprising two companies armed with rifles\\r\\nand the French automatic rifle known as the Chauchat gun, called by the\\r\\ndoughboys \"Sho Sho,\" held out against the best the overpowering forces\\r\\nof the Germans could send against them, and were ultimately rescued from\\r\\ntheir dangerous position.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe training of the Americans was also in modern efficiency that made\\r\\nAmerica prominent in the world of industry. The reduction of the German\\r\\nsalient at St. Mihiel was an object lesson to the Germans in American\\r\\nmethods.  General Pershing commanding that operation in person,\\r\\nassembled the newspaper correspondents the day before the drive. Maps\\r\\nwere shown, giving the extent and locale of the attack. The\\r\\ncorrespondents were invited to follow the American troops and a time\\r\\nschedule for the advance was given to the various corps commanders.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn that operation, 152 square miles of territory and 72 villages were\\r\\ncaptured outright. For the reduction of the German defenses and for the\\r\\ncreeping barrage preceding the American advance, more than 1,500,000\\r\\nshells were fired by the artillery. Approximately 100,000 detail maps\\r\\nand 40,000 photographs prepared largely from aerial observations, were\\r\\nissued for the guidance of the artillery and the infantry. These maps\\r\\nand photographs detailed all the natural and artificial defenses of the\\r\\nentire salient. More than 5,000 miles of telephone wire was laid by\\r\\nAmerican engineers immediately preceding the attack, and as the\\r\\nAmericans advanced on the morning of the battle, September 12, 1918,\\r\\n6,000 telephone instruments were connected with this wire. Ten thousand\\r\\nmen were engaged in operating the hastily constructed telephone system;\\r\\n3,000 carrier pigeons supplemented this work.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the battle American airplanes swept the skies clear of enemy\\r\\nair-craft and signaled instructions to the artillery, besides attacking\\r\\nthe moving infantry, artillery and supply trains of the enemy. So sure\\r\\nwere the Americans of their success that moving-picture operators took\\r\\nmore than 10,000 feet of moving picture film showing the rout of the\\r\\nGermans. Four thousand eight hundred trucks carried food, men and\\r\\nmunitions into the lines. Miles of American railroads, both of standard\\r\\nand narrow gauge, carrying American-made equipment, assisted in the\\r\\ntransportation of men and supplies. Hospital facilities including 35\\r\\nhospital trains, 16,000 beds in the advanced sector, and 55,000 other\\r\\nbeds back of the fighting line, were prepared. Less than ten per cent of\\r\\nthis hospital equipment was used.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the direct consequence of this preparation, which far outstripped\\r\\nanything that any other nation had attempted in a similar offensive, the\\r\\nAmericans with a remarkably small casualty list took 15,188 prisoners,\\r\\n111 guns, many of them of large caliber, immense quantities of munitions\\r\\nand other supplies, and inflicted heavy death losses upon the fleeing\\r\\nGermans.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo selective service laws operated as manhood conscription. The first\\r\\nof these took men between the ages of twenty-one and thirty-one years\\r\\ninclusive. June 5, 1917, was fixed as registration day. The total number\\r\\nenrolled was 9,586,508. The first selective army drawn from this number\\r\\nwas 625,000 men.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second selective service legislation embraced all citizens between\\r\\nthe ages of 18 and 45 inclusive, not included in the first draft. Over\\r\\n13,000,000 men enrolled on September 12, 1918.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grand total of registrants in both drafts was 23,456,021. Youths who\\r\\nhad not completed their 19th year were set apart in a group to be called\\r\\nlast and men between thirty-six and forty-five were also put in a\\r\\ndeferred class. The government\\'s plan was to have approximately\\r\\n5,000,000 men under arms before the summer of 1919. The German armistice\\r\\non November 11th found 4,000,000 men actually under arms and an\\r\\nassignment of 250,000 made to the training camps.\\r\\n\\r\\nA most important factor in the training plans of the United States was\\r\\nthat incorporated in the organization of the Students\\' Army Training\\r\\nCorps, by which 359 American colleges and universities were taken over\\r\\nby the government and 150,000 young men entered these institutions for\\r\\nthe purpose of becoming trained soldiers. The following are the\\r\\nconditions under which the S. A. T. C. was organized:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe War Department undertook to furnish officers, uniforms, rifles, and\\r\\nequipment, and to assign the students to military duty, after a few\\r\\nmonths, either at an officers\\' training camp or in some technical\\r\\nschool, or in a regular army cantonment with troops as a private,\\r\\naccording to the degree of aptitude shown on the college campus.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time a circular letter to the presidents of colleges\\r\\narranged for a contract under which the government became responsible\\r\\nfor the expense of the housing, subsistence, and instruction of the\\r\\nstudents. The preliminary arrangement contained this provision, among\\r\\nothers:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe per diem rate of $1 for subsistence and housing is to govern\\r\\ntemporarily, pending examination of the conditions in the individual\\r\\ninstitution and a careful working out of the costs involved. The amount\\r\\nso fixed is calculated from the experience of this committee during the\\r\\nlast five months in contracting with over 100 collegiate institutions\\r\\nfor the housing and subsistence of over 100,000 soldiers in the National\\r\\nArmy Training Detachment. This experience indicates that the average\\r\\ncost of housing is 15 to 20 cents per day; subsistence (army ration or\\r\\nequivalent), 70 to 80 cents per day. The tuition charge is based on the\\r\\nregular per diem tuition charge of the institution in the year 1917-18.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA permanent contract was arranged later under these governing principles:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basis of payment will be reimbursement for actual and necessary\\r\\ncosts to the institutions for the services rendered to the government in\\r\\nthe maintenance and instruction of the soldiers with the stated\\r\\nlimitation as to cost of instruction. Contract price will be arrived at\\r\\nby agreement after careful study of the conditions in each case, in\\r\\nconference with authorities of the institution.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe War Department will have authority to specify and control the\\r\\ncourses of instruction to be given by the institution.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entity and power for usefulness of the institutions will be\\r\\nsafeguarded so that when the contract ends the institutions shall be in\\r\\ncondition to resume their functions of general education.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe teaching force will be preserved so far as practicable, and this\\r\\nmatter so treated that its members shall feel that in changing to the\\r\\nspecial intensive work desired by the government they are rendering a\\r\\nvital and greatly needed service.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government will ask from the institutions a specific service; that\\r\\nis, the housing, subsistence, and instruction along specified lines of a\\r\\ncertain number of student soldiers. There will be no interference with\\r\\nthe freedom of the institution in conducting other courses in the usual\\r\\nway.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe contract will be for a fixed term, probably nine months, subject to\\r\\nrenewal for a further period on reasonable notice, on terms to be agreed\\r\\nupon and subject to cancellation on similar terms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story of the life of the American army behind the lines in France\\r\\nwould fill a volume. The hospitality of the French people had something\\r\\npathetic in it. They were expecting miracles of their new Allies. They\\r\\nwere war sick. Nearly all of them had lost some father, or brother, or\\r\\nhusband, and here came these big, hearty, joyous soldiers, full of ardor\\r\\nand confident of victory. It put a new spirit into all France. Their\\r\\nreception when they first landed was a scene of such fervor and\\r\\nenthusiasm as had never been known before and probably will not be known\\r\\nagain. Soon the American soldier, in his khaki, with his wide-brimmed\\r\\nsoft hat, became a common sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe villagers put up bunting, calico signs, flags and had stocks of\\r\\nAmerican canned goods to show in their shop windows. The children, when\\r\\nbold, played with the American soldiers, and the children that were more\\r\\nshy ventured to go up and touch an American soldier\\'s leg. Very old\\r\\npeasant ladies put on their Sunday black, and went out walking, and in\\r\\nsome mysterious way talking with American soldiers. The village mayors\\r\\nturned out and made speeches, utterly incomprehensible to the American\\r\\nsoldiers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe engineering, building and machinery works the Americans put up were\\r\\nastonishing. Gangs of workers went over in thousands; many of these were\\r\\ncollege men. They dug and toiled as efficiently as any laborer. One\\r\\nAmerican major told with glee how a party of these young workers arrived\\r\\nstraight from America at 3.30 P. M. and started digging at 5 A. M. next\\r\\nmorning, \"and they liked it, it tickled them to death.\" Many of these\\r\\ndraftees, in fact, were sick and tired of inaction in ports before their\\r\\ndeparture from America, and they welcomed work in France as if it were\\r\\nsome great game.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps the biggest work of all the Americans performed was a certain\\r\\naviation camp and school. In a few months it was completed, and it was\\r\\nthe biggest of its kind in the world. The number of airplanes used\\r\\nmerely for training was in itself remarkable. The flying men--or\\r\\nboys--who had, of course, already been broken-in in America, did an\\r\\nadditional course in France, and when they left the aviation camp they\\r\\nwere absolutely ready for air-fighting at the front. This was the\\r\\nfinishing school. The aviators went through eight distinct courses in\\r\\nthe school. They were perfected in flying, in observation, in bombing,\\r\\nin machine-gun firing. On even a cloudy and windy day the air overhead\\r\\nbuzzed with these young American fliers, all getting into the pink of\\r\\ncondition to do their stunts at the front. They lived in the camp, and\\r\\nit required moving heaven and earth for one of them to get leave to go\\r\\neven to the nearest little quiet old town.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn impression of complete businesslike determination was what one got\\r\\nwhen visiting the Americans in France. A discipline even stricter than\\r\\nthat which applied in British and French troops was in force. In towns,\\r\\nofficers, for instance, were not allowed out after 9 P. M. Some towns\\r\\nwhere subalterns discovered the wine of the country were instantly put\\r\\n\"out of bounds.\" No officer, on any pretext whatsoever was allowed to go\\r\\nto Paris except on official business.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe postal censors who read the letters of the American Expeditionary\\r\\nForce were required to know forty-seven languages! Of these languages,\\r\\nthe two least used were Chinese and German.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe announcement of the organization of the first American Field Army was\\r\\ncontained in the following dispatch from France, August 11, 1918:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The first American field army has been organized. It is under the\\r\\ndirect command of General John J. Pershing, Commander-in-Chief of the\\r\\nAmerican forces. The corps commanders thus far announced are\\r\\nMajor-Generals Liggett, Bullard, Bundy, Read, and Wright.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Chart]\\r\\n  Key\\r\\n  The state of German civilian morale.\\r\\n  Variations in Germany\\'s military position\\r\\n  Decree of political unity in Germany.\\r\\n  The Food situation In North Germany.\\r\\n  Condition of Austria-Hungary.\\r\\n  U-Boat sinkings.

This does not mean\\r\\nthe immediate withdrawal from the British and French commands of all\\r\\nAmerican units, and it is probable that divisions will be used on the\\r\\nFrench and British fronts for weeks yet. It is understood, however, that\\r\\nthe policy of organizing other armies will be carried out steadily.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis announcement marked a milestone in the military effort of the\\r\\nUnited States. When the American troops first arrived in France, they\\r\\nwere associated in small units with the French to get primary training.\\r\\nGradually regiments began to function under French division commanders.\\r\\nThen American divisions were formed and trained under French corps\\r\\ncommanders. Next, American corps began to operate under French army\\r\\ncommanders. Finally, the first American army was created, because enough\\r\\ndivisions and corps had been graduated from the school of experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn American division numbers 30,000 men, and a corps consists of six\\r\\ndivisions, two of which play the part of reserves. With auxiliary\\r\\ntroops, air squadrons, tank sections, heavy artillery, and other\\r\\nbranches, a corps numbers from 225,000 to 250,000 men.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Chart]\\r\\n  The main line in this graph--the heavy broken line--represents the\\r\\n  state of civilian morale in Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\n  German morale is arbitrarily regarded as standing at 100 % in August.\\r\\n  1914.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Zero, for the same line, is taken to be the point at which an\\r\\n  effective majority of the German people will refuse longer to support\\r\\n  the war.\\r\\n\\r\\n  The degree of movement of this line is determined mainly by a\\r\\n  consideration of the deflections of the secondary lines which\\r\\n  represent the forces exerting the greatest influence on the German\\r\\n  state of mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n  SHOWING GERMANY\\'S ROAD TO DEFEAT\\r\\n\\r\\n  Austria\\'s fluctuations are indicated, as well as the morale, military\\r\\n  position, political and food conditions and undersea enterprises of\\r\\n  Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following were the general officers temporarily assigned to command\\r\\nthe first five corps:\\r\\nFirst corps--Major-General Hunter Liggett.\\r\\nSecond corps--Major-General Robert L.

The 42d, or \"Rainbow\" Division, composed\\r\\nof National Guard troops from twenty-six states and the District of\\r\\nColumbia, including the New York 69th Infantry, now designated as the\\r\\n165th Infantry, took part in the fighting in the Champagne east of\\r\\nRheims. The six other divisions were associated with the French in the\\r\\ncounter-offensive between Chateau-Thierry and Soissons. These divisions\\r\\nwere the 1st, 2d, 3d and 4th of the Regular Army, the 26th National\\r\\nGuard Division, composed of troops from the six New England States, and\\r\\nthe 28th, composed of the Pennsylvania National Guard. Marines were\\r\\nincluded in this number. The separate regiment that fought in the\\r\\nChampagne was a negro unit attached to the new 93d Division, composed\\r\\nentirely of negro troops. It was also announced that the 77th Division\\r\\nwas \"in the line near Luneville\" and was \"operating as a division,\\r\\ncomplete under its own commander.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 42d Division had the distinction, General March announced on August\\r\\n3d, of defeating the 4th Division of the crack Prussian Guards,\\r\\nprofessional soldiers of the German standing army, who had never before\\r\\nfailed. General March also disclosed the fact that another American\\r\\ndivision had been sent into that part of the Rheims salient where the\\r\\nGermans showed resistance. This was the 32d Division. \"The American\\r\\ndivisions in the Rheims salient,\" General March said, \"have now been put\\r\\nin contiguously and are actually getting together as an American force.\\r\\nSoutheast of Fere-en-Tardenois our 1st Corps is operating, with General\\r\\nLiggett in actual command.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe organization of twelve new divisions was announced by General March,\\r\\nChief of Staff, in statements made on July 24th and July 31st. These\\r\\ndivisions were numerically designated from 9 to 20, and organized at\\r\\nCamps Devens, Meade, Sheridan, Custer, Funston, Lewis, Logan, Kearny,\\r\\nBeauregard, Travis, Dodge, and Sevier. Each division had two infantry\\r\\nregiments of the regular army as nucleus, the other elements being made\\r\\nup of drafted men. The new divisions moved into the designated camps as\\r\\nthe divisions already trained there moved out.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe composition of an American division is as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo brigades of infantry, each consisting of two regiments of infantry\\r\\nand one machine-gun battalion.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne brigade of artillery, consisting of three regiments of field\\r\\nartillery, and one trench mortar battery.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne regiment of engineers.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne field signal battalion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following trains: Headquarters and military police, sanitary,\\r\\nsupply, engineer, and ammunition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following division units: Headquarters troop and one machine-gun\\r\\nbattalion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph]\\r\\n  Copyright International Film Service.\\r\\n  SAFE ON SHORE AT LAST\\r\\n  Arrival of American troops in Liverpool after defying the perils of\\r\\n  the submarine.

The text of the\\r\\norder read:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1. This country has but one army--the United States Army. It includes\\r\\nall the land forces in the service of the United States. Those forces,\\r\\nhowever raised, lose their identity in that of the United States Army.\\r\\nDistinctive appellations, such as the Regular Army, Reserve Corps,\\r\\nNational Army, and National Guard, heretofore employed in administration\\r\\ncommand, will be discontinued, and the single term, the United States\\r\\nArmy, will be exclusively used.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Orders having reference to the United States Army as divided in\\r\\nseparate and component forces of distinct origin, or assuming or\\r\\ncontemplating such a division, are to that extent revoked.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. The insignia now prescribed for the Regular Army shall hereafter be\\r\\nworn by the United States Army.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. All effective commissions purporting to be, and described therein, as\\r\\ncommissions in the Regular Army, National Guard, National Army, or the\\r\\nReserve Corps, shall hereafter be held to be, and regarded as,\\r\\ncommissions in the United States Army--permanent, provisional, or\\r\\ntemporary, as fixed by the conditions of their issue; and all such\\r\\ncommissions are hereby amended accordingly. Hereafter during the period\\r\\nof the existing emergency all commissions of officers shall be in the\\r\\nUnited States Army and in staff corps, departments, and arms of the\\r\\nservice thereof, and shall, as the law may provide, be permanent, for a\\r\\nterm, or for the period of the emergency. And hereafter during the\\r\\nperiod of the existing emergency provisional and temporary appointments\\r\\nin the grade of second lieutenant and temporary promotions in the\\r\\nRegular Army and appointments in the Reserve Corps will be discontinued.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. While the number of commissions in each grade and each staff corps,\\r\\ndepartment, and arm of the service shall be kept within the limits fixed\\r\\nby law, officers shall be assigned without reference to the term of\\r\\ntheir commissions solely in the interest of the service; and officers\\r\\nand enlisted men will be transferred from one organization to another as\\r\\nthe interests of the service may require.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Except as otherwise provided by law, promotion in the United States\\r\\nArmy shall be by selection. Permanent promotions in the Regular Army\\r\\nwill continue to be made as prescribed by law.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXIV\\r\\n\\r\\nHOW FOOD WON THE WAR\\r\\n\\r\\nFood won the war. Without the American farmer the Entente Allies must\\r\\nhave capitulated. Wheat, beef, corn, foods of every variety,\\r\\nhermetically sealed in tins, were thrown into the scales on the side of\\r\\nthe Entente Allies in sufficient quantities to tip the balance toward\\r\\nthe side of civilization and against autocracy. Late in the fall of 1918\\r\\nwhen victory was assured to America and the Allies, there was received\\r\\nthis message of appreciation from General Pershing to the farmers of\\r\\nAmerica, through Carl Vrooman, Assistant Secretary of Agriculture:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAMERICAN EXPEDITIONARY FORCES,\\r\\nOffice of the Commander-in-Chief, France,\\r\\nOctober 16, 1918.\\r\\nHonorable CARL VROOMAN, Assistant Secretary of Agriculture:\\r\\nDEAR MR. VROOMAN:--Will you please convey to farmers of America our\\r\\nprofound appreciation of their patriotic services to the country and to\\r\\nthe Allied armies in the field. They have furnished their full quota of\\r\\nfighting men; they have bought largely of Liberty Bonds; and they have\\r\\nincreased their production of food crops both last year and this by over\\r\\na thousand million bushels above normal production. Food is of vital\\r\\nmilitary necessity for us and for our Allies, and from the day of our\\r\\nentry into the war America\\'s armies of food producers have rendered\\r\\ninvaluable service to the Allied cause by supporting the soldiers at the\\r\\nfront through their devoted and splendidly successful work in the fields\\r\\nand furrows at home.\\r\\nVery sincerely,\\r\\nJOHN J. PERSHING.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis tribute to the men and women on the farms of America from the head\\r\\nof the American forces in France is fit recognition of the important\\r\\npart played by American food producers in the war. It was early\\r\\nrecognized by all the belligerent powers that final victory was a\\r\\nquestion of national morale and national endurance. Morale could not be\\r\\nmaintained without food. The bread lines in Petrograd gave birth to the\\r\\nrevolution, and Russian famine was the mother of Russian terrorism.\\r\\nGerman men and women, starved of fats and sweets, deteriorated so\\r\\nrapidly that the crime ratio both in towns and country districts mounted\\r\\nappallingly. Conditions in Austria-Hungary were even worse. Acute\\r\\ndistress arising from threatening famine was instrumental in driving\\r\\nBulgaria out of the war. The whole of Central Europe indeed was in the\\r\\nshadow of famine and the masses were crying out for peace at any price.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, Germany\\'s greatest reliance for a victorious decision\\r\\nlay in the U-boat blockade of Great Britain, France and Italy. Though\\r\\nsome depredations came to these countries, the submarine blockade never\\r\\nfully materialized and with its failure Germany\\'s hopes faded and died.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Entente Allies and the United States were fortunate in securing\\r\\nHerbert C. Hoover to administer food distribution throughout their lands\\r\\nand to stimulate food production by the farmers of the United States.\\r\\nAfter his signal success in the administration of the Belgian Relief\\r\\nCommission, Mr. Hoover became the unanimous choice of the Allies for the\\r\\nvictualing of the militant and civilian populations after America\\'s\\r\\nentrance into the World War. His work divided itself into three heads:\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, stimulation of food production.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond, elimination of food wastage in the homes and public eating\\r\\nplaces of the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird, education of food dealers and the public in the use of such foods\\r\\nas were substitutes for wheat, rye, pork, beef and sugar.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter long and acrimonious debates in Congress, Mr. Hoover, as Federal\\r\\nFood Administrator, was clothed with extraordinary powers enabling him\\r\\nto fulfil the purposes for which he was appointed. The ability with\\r\\nwhich he and his associates performed their work was demonstrated in the\\r\\ncomplete debacle of Bulgaria, Turkey, Austria-Hungary and Germany. These\\r\\ncountries were starved out quite as truly as they were fought out. The\\r\\nconcrete evidence of the Food Administration\\'s success is shown in the\\r\\nsubjoined table which indicates the increase over normal in exporting of\\r\\nfoodstuffs by the United States since it became the food reservoir for\\r\\nthe world on account of the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nTOTAL EXPORTS\\r\\n    3-year          1916-17      1917-18      July, 1917 to    July,1918 to\\r\\n    pre-war         fiscal       fiscal\\r\\n    average.        year.        year.

These amounts include all\\r\\nshipments to allied countries for their and our armies, the civilian\\r\\npopulation, the Belgium relief, and the Red Cross. The figures indicate\\r\\nthe measure of effort of the American people in support of allied food\\r\\nsupplies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total value of these food shipments, which were in the main\\r\\npurchased through, or with the collaboration of the Food Administration,\\r\\namounted to, roundly, $1,400,000,000 during the fiscal year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shipments of meats and fats (including meat products, dairy\\r\\nproducts, vegetable oils, etc.) to allied destinations were as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    POUNDS\\r\\n  Fiscal year 1916-17   2,166,500,000\\r\\n  Fiscal year 1917-18   3,011,100,000\\r\\n                      -----------------\\r\\n  Increase                844,600,000\\r\\n\\r\\nOur slaughterable animals at the beginning of the last fiscal year were\\r\\nnot appreciably larger in number than the year before; and particularly\\r\\nin hogs, there were probably less. The increase in shipments is due to\\r\\nconservation and the extra weight of animals added by our farmers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe full effect of these efforts began to bear their best results in the\\r\\nlast half of the fiscal year, when the exports to the Allies were\\r\\n2,133,100,000 pounds, as against 1,266,500,000 pounds in the same period\\r\\nof the year before. This compares with an average of 801,000,000 pounds\\r\\nof total exports for the same half years of the three-year pre-war\\r\\nperiod.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn cereals and cereal products reduced to terms of cereal bushels, our\\r\\nshipments to allied destinations have been:\\r\\n\\r\\n    BUSHELS\\r\\n  Fiscal year 1916-17   259,900,000\\r\\n  Fiscal year 1917-18   340,800,000\\r\\n                       ------------\\r\\n  Increase               80,900,000\\r\\n\\r\\nOf these cereals our shipments of the prime breadstuffs in the fiscal\\r\\nyear 1917-18 to allied destinations were: Wheat, 131,000,000 bushels and\\r\\nrye 13,900,000 bushels, a total of 144,900,000 bushels.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exports to allied destinations during the fiscal year 1916-17 were:\\r\\nWheat, 135,100,000 bushels and rye, 2,300,000 bushels, a total of\\r\\n137,400,000 bushels. In addition, some 10,000,000 bushels of 1917 wheat\\r\\nare now in port for allied destinations or en route thereto. The total\\r\\nshipments to allied countries from our last harvest of wheat will be,\\r\\ntherefore, about 141,000,000 bushels, or a total of 154,900,000 bushels\\r\\nof prime breadstuffs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to this we have shipped some 10,000,000 bushels to neutrals\\r\\ndependent upon us and we have received some imports from other quarters.\\r\\nA large part of the other cereals exported has also gone into war bread.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is interesting to note that since the urgent request of the Allied\\r\\nFood Controllers early in the year for a further shipment of 75,000,000\\r\\nbushels from our 1917 wheat than originally planned, we shall have\\r\\nshipped to Europe, or have en route, nearly 85,000,000 bushels. At the\\r\\ntime of this request our surplus was already more than exhausted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis accomplishment of our people in this matter stands out even more\\r\\nclearly if we bear in mind that we had available in the fiscal year\\r\\n1916-17 from net carryover and a surplus over our normal consumption\\r\\nabout 200,000,000 bushels of wheat which we were able to export that\\r\\nyear without trenching on our home loaf. This last year, however, owing\\r\\nto the large failure of the 1917 wheat crop we had available from net\\r\\ncarry over and production and imports only just about our normal\\r\\nconsumption. Therefore our wheat shipments to allied destinations\\r\\nrepresent approximately savings from our own wheat bread.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese figures, however, do not fully convey the volume of the effort and\\r\\nsacrifice made during the past year by the whole American people.\\r\\nDespite the magnificent effort of our agricultural population in\\r\\nplanting a much increased acreage in 1917, not only was there a very\\r\\nlarge failure in wheat, but also the corn failed to mature properly, and\\r\\ncorn is our dominant crop.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe calculate that the total nutritional production of the country for\\r\\nthe fiscal year just closed was between seven per cent and nine per cent\\r\\nbelow the average of the three previous years, our nutritional surplus\\r\\nfor export in those years being about the same amount as the shrinkage\\r\\nlast year. Therefore the consumption and waste in food have greatly\\r\\nreduced in every direction during the year.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am sure that the millions of our people, agricultural as well as\\r\\nurban, who have contributed to these results, should feel a very\\r\\ndefinite satisfaction that, in a year of universal food shortage in the\\r\\nNorthern Hemisphere, all of these people joined together against Germany\\r\\nhave come through into sight of the coming harvest not only with health\\r\\nand strength fully maintained, but with only temporary periods of\\r\\nhardship. The European Allies have been compelled to sacrifice more than\\r\\nour own people, but we have not failed to load every steamer since the\\r\\ndelays of the storm months of last winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur contributions to this end could not have been accomplished without\\r\\neffort and sacrifice, and it is a matter for further satisfaction, that\\r\\nit had been accomplished voluntarily and individually. It is difficult\\r\\nto distinguish between various sections of our people--the homes, public\\r\\neating places, food trades, urban or agricultural populations--in\\r\\nassessing credit for these results, but no one will deny the dominant\\r\\npart of the American woman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the work of the Food Administration did not come to an end with the\\r\\nclose of the war. Insistent cries for food came from the members of the\\r\\ndefeated Teutonic alliance, as well as from the suffering Allied and\\r\\nneutral nations. To meet those demands, Mr. Hoover sailed for Europe to\\r\\norganize the food relief of the needy nations. The State Department,\\r\\nexplaining his mission, stated that as the first measure of assistance\\r\\nto Belgium it was necessary to increase immediately the volume of\\r\\nfoodstuffs formerly supplied, so as to physically rehabilitate this\\r\\nunder-nourished population. The relief commission during the four years\\r\\nof war sent to the 10,000,000 people in the occupied area over 600\\r\\ncargoes of food, comprising 120,000,000 bushels of breadstuffs and over\\r\\n3,000,000,000 pounds of other foodstuffs besides 20,000,000 garments,\\r\\nthe whole representing an expenditure of nearly $600,000,000. The\\r\\nsupport of the commission came from the Belgian, British, French and\\r\\nAmerican governments, together with public charity. In addition to this\\r\\nsome $350,000,000 worth of native produce was financed internally in\\r\\nBelgium by the relief organization.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second portion of Mr. Hoover\\'s mission was to organize and determine\\r\\nthe need of foodstuffs to the liberated populations in Southern\\r\\nEurope--the Czecho-Slovaks, the Jugo-Slavs, and Serbians, Roumanians and\\r\\nothers.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo meet the conditions in Europe following the armistice of November 11,\\r\\n1918, the employment service of the United States set to work laying\\r\\nfar-reaching plans for meeting the problem of world food shortage. The\\r\\ndemands after the war were greater than they had been during the\\r\\nconflict but the nation that had fed the allies of civilization in war\\r\\ntime performed the task of feeding the world, friend and foe alike, when\\r\\npeace at length came upon the earth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXV\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE UNITED STATES NAVY IN THE WAR\\r\\n\\r\\nLong before war was declared the United States Government had been\\r\\nengaged in preparation. It had realized that unrestricted submarine\\r\\nwarfare was sure to lead to war, and though for a time it was preserving\\r\\nwhat it was pleased to call \"an armed neutrality\" the President\\r\\ndoubtless was well aware what such an \"armed neutrality\" would lead to.\\r\\nMerchant ships were being armed for protection against the submarine,\\r\\nand crews from the Navy assigned to work the guns. The first collision\\r\\nwas sure to mean an active state of war. The Naval Department,\\r\\ntherefore, was working at full speed, getting the Navy ready for active\\r\\nservice as soon as war should be declared.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecretary Daniels made every effort to obtain the crews that were\\r\\nnecessary to man the new ships which were being fully commissioned with\\r\\nthe greatest possible speed and called upon newspapers all through the\\r\\ncountry to do their utmost to stimulate enlistment.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 26th President Wilson issued an order increasing the enlisted\\r\\nstrength of the United States Marine Corps to 17,400 men, the limit\\r\\nallowed under the law. On March 29th a hundred and three ensigns were\\r\\ngraduated from the Naval Academy three months ahead of their time, and\\r\\non April 6th, as soon as war was declared, the Navy was mobilized.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin a few minutes after Secretary Daniels had signed the order for\\r\\nthis purpose one hundred code messages were sent out from the office of\\r\\nAdmiral W. S. Benson, Chief of Naval Operations, which placed the Navy\\r\\non a war basis, and put into the control of the Navy Department the\\r\\nnaval militia of all the states as well as the Naval Reserves and the\\r\\nCoast Guard Service. In the Naval Militia were about 584 officers, and\\r\\n7,933 men. These were at once assembled and assigned to coast patrol\\r\\nservice. All of the ships that were in active commission in the Navy\\r\\nwere already ready for duty. But there were reserve battleships and\\r\\nreserve destroyers, besides ships which had been out of commission which\\r\\nhad to be manned as quickly as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the beginning of the war there were 361 vessels ready for service,\\r\\nincluding twelve first-line battleships, twenty-five second-line\\r\\nbattleships, nine armored cruisers, twenty-four other cruisers, seven\\r\\nmonitors, fifty destroyers, sixteen coast torpedo vessels, seventeen\\r\\ntorpedo boats, forty-four submarines, eight tenders to torpedo boats,\\r\\ntwenty-eight gunboats, four transports, four supply ships, one hospital\\r\\nship, twenty-one fuel ships, fourteen converted yachts, forty-nine tugs,\\r\\nand twenty-eight minor vessels. There were about seventy thousand\\r\\nregularly enlisted men, besides eight thousand five hundred members of\\r\\nthe naval militia. Many yachts together with their volunteer crews had\\r\\nbeen offered to the government by patriotic citizens.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the complete mobilization of the Navy, as it then stood, 99,809\\r\\nregularly enlisted men and 45,870 reserves were necessary. About\\r\\ntwenty-seven thousand of these were needed for coast defense, and twelve\\r\\nthousand at the various shore stations. Retired officers were called\\r\\nout, and assigned to duty which would permit officers on the active list\\r\\nto be employed in sea duty. The Navy therefore still lacked thirty-five\\r\\nthousand men to bring it up to its full authorized strength at the\\r\\nbeginning, but after the declaration of war an active recruiting\\r\\ncampaign brought volunteers by thousands. The service was a popular one\\r\\nand recruits were easily obtained.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the first phases of the mobilization was the organization of a\\r\\nlarge fleet of mosquito craft to patrol the Atlantic Coast, and keep on\\r\\nthe watch for submarines. Many of these boats had been private yachts,\\r\\nand hundreds of young men volunteered from the colleges and schools of\\r\\nthe country for this work. Many boat builders submitted proposals to\\r\\nconstruct small boats for this kind of patrol duty, and on March 31st a\\r\\ncoast patrol fleet was organized by the government under the command of\\r\\nCaptain Henry B. Wilson.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Navy took possession immediately on the declaration of war of all\\r\\nwireless stations in the United States dismantling all that could not be\\r\\nuseful to the government. War zones were established along the whole\\r\\ncoast line of the United States, making a series of local barred zones\\r\\nextending from the larger harbors in American waters all along the line.\\r\\nThese harbors were barred at night to entering vessels in order to guard\\r\\nagainst surprise by German submarines. Contracts were awarded for the\\r\\nconstruction of twenty-four destroyers even before war was declared, and\\r\\nmany more were already under construction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map]\\r\\n  MAP OF THE UNITED STATES SHOWING THE IMMENSE LENGTH OF COAST-LINE TO\\r\\n  BE DEFENDED\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe growth of the Navy in one year may give some idea of the efficiency\\r\\nof the Navy Department. In April, 1917, the regular Navy contained 4,366\\r\\nofficers and 64,680 men. In April, 1918, it contained 7,798 officers and\\r\\n192,385 men. In the Marine Corps in 1917 there were 426 officers and\\r\\n13,266 men. In one year this was increased to 1,389 officers and 38,629\\r\\nmen. In the organization of the Naval Reserves, naval volunteers and\\r\\ncoast guards there were in 1917, 24,569 men, in 1918, 98,319 men, and\\r\\n11,477 officers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile personnel of the Navy was thus expanding the United States battle\\r\\nfleet had grown to more than twice the size of the fleet before the war.\\r\\nWhen war was declared there were under construction 123 new naval\\r\\nvessels. These were completed and contracts made for 949 new vessels.\\r\\nAmong the ships completed are fifteen battleships, six battle cruisers,\\r\\nseven scout cruisers, twenty-seven destroyers, and sixty-one submarines.\\r\\nAbout eight hundred craft were taken over and converted into transports,\\r\\npatrol service boats, submarine chasers, mine sweepers and mine layers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government also seized 109 German ships which had been interned in\\r\\nAmerican ports. The Germans had attempted to damage these ships so that\\r\\nthey would be useless, but they were all repaired, and carried American\\r\\ntroops and supplies in great quantities to France.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the fleet grew the training of the necessary officers and crews was\\r\\nconducted on a grand scale. Naval camps were established at various\\r\\npoints. The main ones were those at Philadelphia, (League Island);\\r\\nNewport, Rhode Island; Cape May, New Jersey; Charleston, South Carolina;\\r\\nPensacola, Florida; Key West, Florida; Mare Island, California; Puget\\r\\nSound, Washington; Hingham, Massachusetts; Norfolk, Virginia; New\\r\\nOrleans, San Diego, New York Navy Yard; Great Lakes, Illinois; Pelham,\\r\\nNew York; Hampton Roads, Virginia; and Gulfport, Mississippi. Schools in\\r\\ngunnery and engineering were established and thousands of gunners and\\r\\nengineers were trained, not only for the Navy but for the armed merchant\\r\\nvessels.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe training of gun crews by target practice was a feature of this work.\\r\\nLong before the war began systematic training of this kind had been\\r\\ndone, but mainly in connection with the big guns, and great efficiency\\r\\nhad been obtained by the steady practice. With the introduction of the\\r\\nsubmarine, it became necessary to pay special attention to the training\\r\\nof the crews of guns of smaller caliber, and it was not long before the\\r\\nofficers of our Navy were congratulating themselves on the efficiency of\\r\\ntheir men. It is not easy to hit so small a mark as the periscope of a\\r\\nsubmarine, but it could be done and many times was done.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwenty-eight days after the declaration of war a fleet of United States\\r\\ndestroyers under the command of Admiral William S. Sims reported for\\r\\nservice at a British port.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American destroyer squadron arrived at Queenstown after a voyage\\r\\nwithout incident. The water front was lined with an excited crowd\\r\\ncarrying small American flags, which cheered the destroyers from the\\r\\ntime they were first seen until they reached the dock. They cheered\\r\\nagain when Admiral Sims went ashore to greet the British senior officer\\r\\nwho had come to welcome the Americans. It was a most informal function.\\r\\nAfter the usual handshakes the British commander congratulated the\\r\\nAmericans on their safe voyage and then asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When will you be ready for business?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We can start at once,\" was the prompt reply of Admiral Sims.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis rather took the breath away from the British commander and he said\\r\\nhe had not expected the Americans to begin work so soon after their long\\r\\nvoyage. Later after a short tour of the destroyers he admitted that the\\r\\nAmerican tars looked prepared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said the American commander, \"we made preparations on the way\\r\\nover. That is why we are ready.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything on board the destroyers was in excellent condition. The only\\r\\nthing lacking was heavier clothing. The American uniforms were too light\\r\\nfor the cool weather which is common in the English waters. This\\r\\ncondition, however, was quickly remedied, and the American ships at once\\r\\nput out to sea all in splendid condition and filled with the same\\r\\nenthusiasm that the Marines showed later at Chateau-Thierry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are certainly a fine body of men, and what\\'s more, their craft\\r\\nlooked just as fit,\" declared the British commander.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the American destroyers, even before the American fleet had\\r\\narrived at Queenstown, had begun war duty. It had picked up and escorted\\r\\nthrough the danger zone one of the largest of the Atlantic liners. The\\r\\npassengers on board the liner sent the commander of the destroyer the\\r\\nfollowing message:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBritish passengers on board a steamer, bound for a British port, under\\r\\nthe protection of an American destroyer, send their hearty greetings to\\r\\nher commander and her officers and crew, and desire to express their\\r\\nkeen appreciation of this practical co-operation between the government\\r\\nand people of the United States and the British Empire, who are now\\r\\nfighting together for the freedom of the seas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMoving pictures were taken by the official British Government\\r\\nphotographer as the American flotilla came into the harbor, and sailors\\r\\nwho received shore leave were plied with English hospitality. The\\r\\nstreets of Queenstown were decorated with the Stars and Stripes. As soon\\r\\nas American residents in England learned that American warships were to\\r\\ncross the Atlantic they held a conference to provide recreation\\r\\nbuildings, containing sleeping, eating, and recreation accommodations\\r\\nfor the comfort of the American sailors. The destroyer flotilla was the\\r\\nfirst contribution of American military power to the Entente Alliance\\r\\nagainst Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmiral Sims is one of the most energetic and efficient of American\\r\\nnaval officers and to him as much as to any other man is due the\\r\\nefficiency of the American Navy. During the period just before the\\r\\nSpanish-American War Lieutenant Sims was Naval Attache at Paris, and\\r\\nrendered invaluable services in buying ships and supplies for the Navy.\\r\\nIn 1900 he was assigned to duty on the battleship Kentucky, then\\r\\nstationed in the Orient. In 1902 he was ordered to the Navy Department\\r\\nand placed in charge of the Office of Naval Practice, where he remained\\r\\nfor seven years and devoted his attention to the improvement of the Navy\\r\\nin gunnery. During that time he made constant trips to England to\\r\\nconsult with English experts in gunnery and ordnance, and became\\r\\nintimately acquainted with Sir Percy Scott, who had been knighted and\\r\\nmade Rear-Admiral for the improvements he had introduced in connection\\r\\nwith the gunnery of the British warships. In 1909 he was made commander\\r\\nof the battleship Minnesota, and in 1911 was a member of the college\\r\\nstaff at the Naval War College. In 1913 he was made commander of the\\r\\ntorpedo flotilla of the Atlantic fleet and in 1905 assigned to command\\r\\nthe Dreadnaught Nevada. In 1916 he was President of the Naval War\\r\\nCollege. He was made Rear-Admiral in 1916 and Vice-Admiral in 1917 and\\r\\nassigned to the command of all American war vessels abroad.\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately upon their arrival the American vessels began operation in\\r\\nthe submarine zone. Admiral Beatty then addressed the following message\\r\\nto Admiral Henry T. Mayo of the United States Atlantic Fleet:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grand Fleet rejoices that the Atlantic fleet will now share in\\r\\npreserving the liberties of the world and in maintaining the chivalry of\\r\\nthe sea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmiral Mayo replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States Atlantic Fleet appreciates the message from the\\r\\nBritish fleet and welcomes opportunities for work with the British fleet\\r\\nfor the freedom of the seas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may also be noted, as a fact which is not without significance, that\\r\\nthe losses by submarine which had reached their highest mark in the last\\r\\nweek in April began from that time steadily to diminish.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the main duties of the Navy was to convoy transports and supplies\\r\\nacross the Atlantic. This was done with the assistance of Allied vessels\\r\\nwith remarkable success. For a long period it seemed as if the U-boats\\r\\nwould not be able to penetrate through the Allied convoy, but during\\r\\n1918 four transports were torpedoed. The first was the Tuscania which\\r\\nwas sunk in February off the north coast of Ireland, with 1,912 officers\\r\\nand men of the Michigan and Wisconsin guardsmen, of whom 204 were lost.\\r\\nThe Oronsa, which was torpedoed in April, contained 250 men and all were\\r\\nsaved except three of the crew. The Moldavia came next with five hundred\\r\\ntroops, of whom fifty-five were lost. On September 6th the troopship\\r\\nPersic with 2,800 American soldiers was torpedoed but American\\r\\ndestroyers rescued all on board, and the Persic, which was prevented\\r\\nfrom sinking by its water-tight bulkheads, was afterwards beached.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral American ships, including the troop transport Mount Vernon, were\\r\\ntorpedoed on return trips and a number of the men of their crews were\\r\\nlost, and several naval vessels were lost, including the destroyer Jacob\\r\\nJones, and the patrol vessel Alcedo. The Cassin was torpedoed, but\\r\\nreached port under its own steam and later returned to service.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September and October three more American transports were added to\\r\\nthe list of American losses. On September 26th the United States steamer\\r\\nTampa was torpedoed and sank with all on board, losing 118 men. On\\r\\nSeptember 30th the Ticonderoga was also torpedoed, eleven naval officers\\r\\nand 102 enlisted men being lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to these submarine losses several ships and a number of men\\r\\nwere lost through collision. The United States steamer Westgate was sunk\\r\\nin a collision with the steamer American on October 7th, with the loss\\r\\nof seven men. On October 9th the United States destroyer Shaw lost\\r\\nfifteen men in a collision, though she later succeeded in reaching port.\\r\\nOn October 11th the American steamer Otranto was sunk in a collision\\r\\nwith the British liner Cashmere. Of seven hundred American soldiers who\\r\\nwere on board 365 were lost. At this time about three thousand\\r\\nanti-submarine craft were in operation day and night around the British\\r\\nIsles, and about five thousand working in the open sea. This was what\\r\\nmade it possible for the Allies to win the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nInasmuch as the illegal use of the submarine by Germany brought America\\r\\ninto the war it was extremely appropriate that she should take an active\\r\\npart in the suppression of the submarine menace. The methods which were\\r\\nused in fighting the submarines differed much in different cases. The\\r\\naction of the government in arming merchantmen and in providing them\\r\\nwith trained gun crews did much to lower the number of such ships sunk\\r\\nby the U-boats.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe submarine, which had formerly been able to stop the unarmed\\r\\nmerchantman and sink him at leisure, after a few combats with an armed\\r\\nmerchantman began to be very wary and to depend almost entirely upon his\\r\\ntorpedoes. It was not always easy for the submarine to get in a position\\r\\nwhere her torpedo would be effective, and the merchantman was carefully\\r\\ndirected, if attacked, to pursue a ziz-zag irregular course, and at the\\r\\nsame time endeavor to hamper the submarine by shooting as near her\\r\\nperiscope as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong the sea coasts and at certain points in the English Channel great\\r\\nnets were used effectively. Submarines, however, toward the end of the\\r\\nwar were made sufficiently large to be able to force their way through\\r\\nthese nets, and net-cutting devices were also used by them with\\r\\nconsiderable effect. The best way to destroy the submarines seemed to be\\r\\nin a direct attack by flotillas of destroyers.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of the war the whole process of sinking or destroying\\r\\nsubmarines had been thoroughly organized. Practically every portion of\\r\\nthe seas near Great Britain and France was carefully watched and the\\r\\nappearance of a submarine immediately reported. As the submarine would\\r\\nonly travel at a certain well-understood speed during a given time, it\\r\\nwas possible to calculate, after the locality of one was known, about\\r\\nhow far from that point it would be found at any later period.\\r\\nDestroyers were therefore sent circling around the point where the\\r\\nsubmarine had been discovered, enlarging their distance from the center\\r\\nevery hour. In the course of time the submarine would be compelled to\\r\\ncome up for air, and then, if luck were with the destroyer, it might\\r\\nfind its foe before it was seen itself. Having discovered the submarine\\r\\nthe destroyer immediately endeavored to ram, dropping depth bombs at the\\r\\npoint where they supposed the enemy to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese bombs were so constructed that at a certain depth in the water\\r\\nthey would explode, and the force of the explosion was so great that\\r\\neven if they did not strike the submarine they would be sure to damage\\r\\nit seriously, sometimes throwing the submarine to the surface partly out\\r\\nof water, and at other times driving her to come to the surface herself\\r\\nready to surrender.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn many cases it was not necessary to use the depth bomb at all. The\\r\\ngunners on board the destroyers had become extraordinarily expert, and\\r\\nthough a shot might destroy the periscope of a submarine without doing\\r\\nmuch damage, most submarines carrying extra periscopes to use if\\r\\nnecessary, yet it was soon found that it was possible by the use of\\r\\nplunging shells to do effective damage. Plunging shells are somewhat\\r\\nsimilar in their operation to bombs. Such a shell falling just short of\\r\\na periscope and fused to burst both on contact and at a certain depth\\r\\nwas extremely likely to do damage.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the pursuit of the U-boat the airplane was also extremely effective.\\r\\nThese were sent out to patrol large districts near the Allied coast, and\\r\\nalso, in some cases, from ships themselves. It is possible in certain\\r\\nweather conditions for the observer on an airplane to detect a submarine\\r\\neven when it is submerged and the airplane can not only attack the\\r\\nsubmarine by dropping depth bombs, but it can signal at once the\\r\\nlocation of the enemy to the hurrying destroyers. Indeed, as the\\r\\nsubmarine warfare proceeded the main difficulty of the Allies was to\\r\\nlocate the submarines. Many ingenious devices were used for this\\r\\npurpose, and many of the English vessels had listening attachments under\\r\\nwater which were intended to make it possible to hear a submarine as it\\r\\nmoved. These, however, do not seem to have been very effective. The\\r\\nsubmarine itself seems at times to have been fitted out in a similar way\\r\\nand to have thus been able to hear the sound of an approaching ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany thrilling reports of naval actions against German submarines were\\r\\ngiven out officially by the British admiralty from time to time. In most\\r\\nof these cases the submarine was both rammed and attacked by depth\\r\\nbombs. In nearly all of them the only proof of success was the oil and\\r\\nair bubbles which came to the surface.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne interesting encounter was that in which a British submarine sighted\\r\\na German U-boat, while both were on the surface. The British submarine\\r\\ndived and later was able to pick up the enemy through the periscope and\\r\\ndischarge a torpedo in such a way as to destroy the German vessel. When\\r\\nthe British submarine arose it found a patch of oil in which Germans\\r\\nwere swimming.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrdinarily, however, a submarine was of little service in a fight\\r\\nagainst another for the radius of sight from a periscope is so short\\r\\nthat it is practically blind so far as another periscope is concerned.\\r\\nThis blindness of the submarine was taken advantage of by the Allies in\\r\\nevery possible way.\\r\\n\\r\\nMerchant ships were camouflaged, that is painted in such a way that they\\r\\ncould not be easily distinguished at a distance. In the great convoys\\r\\nships were often hidden by great masses of smoke to prevent a submarine\\r\\nfrom finding an easy mark. At night all lights were put out or else so\\r\\nshaded as not to be seen by the enemy. The result of these methods was\\r\\nthe gradual destruction of the U-boat menace.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the summer of 1918, while occasionally some ship was lost, the\\r\\nproduction of new ships was much greater than those that were sunk.\\r\\nDuring the month of June it was announced that the completion of new\\r\\ntonnage by the Allies had outstripped the losses  by thousands of tons.\\r\\nDuring this period the United States had attained its full stride in\\r\\nbuilding ships, airplanes and ordnance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Painting]\\r\\n  \"HAIL COLUMBIA\"\\r\\n  England greets the first American destroyer squadron to arrive in\\r\\n  European waters after the United States entered the war. The British\\r\\n  admiral asked Admiral Sims, who was in command, how long he needed to\\r\\n  refit and get ready for action. He replied \"We are ready now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Painting]\\r\\n  THE DAY\\'S WORK OF UNCLE SAM\\'S DESTROYERS\\r\\n  More than 2,000,000 men were safely landed in France guarded by the\\r\\n  destroyers, ready day or night whenever an enemy submarine threatened\\r\\n  a convoy, as was the case here in a trip over of the Adriatic loaded\\r\\n  with troops. In the foreground is the periscope of the attacking\\r\\n  submarine trying to submerge before she is hit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nArchibald Hurd, the English naval expert, said: \"When the war is over\\r\\nthe nation will form some conception of the debt which we owe the\\r\\nAmerican Navy for the manner in which it has co-operated, not only in\\r\\nconnection with the convoy system, but in fighting the submarines. If\\r\\nthe naval position is improving today, as it is, it is due to the fact\\r\\nthat the British and American fleets are working in closest accord,\\r\\nsupported by an immense body of skilled workers on both sides of the\\r\\nAtlantic, who are turning out destroyers and other craft for dealing\\r\\nwith the submarine, as well as mines and bombs. Some of the finest\\r\\nbattleships of the United States Navy are now associated with the\\r\\nBritish Grand fleet. They are not only splendid fighting ships but they\\r\\nare well officered and manned.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 13, 1918, in appreciation of some remarks which had been made by\\r\\nSir Eric Geddes, First Lord of the British Admiralty, Josephus Daniels,\\r\\nthe American Secretary of the Navy, addressed a letter to him in the\\r\\nfollowing terms:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your reference to the splendid spirit of co-operation between the\\r\\nnavies of our countries, and your warm praise of the officers and men of\\r\\nour navy, have been most grateful to me and to all Americans. The\\r\\nbrightest spot in the tragedy of this war is this mutual appreciation of\\r\\nthe men in the naval service. Our officers who have returned confirm the\\r\\nstatements of Admiral Sims of the courtesies and kindness shown in every\\r\\nway by the admiralty and the officers of the British fleet. I had hoped\\r\\nto have the pleasure of visiting Great Britain and of personally\\r\\nexpressing this feeling of mutual working together, but the task here of\\r\\nmaking ready more and more units for the fleet is a very serious one,\\r\\nand my duty chains me here. The order in all the Navy is \\'Full speed\\r\\nahead\\' in the construction of destroyers and other craft, and the whole\\r\\nservice is keyed up to press this program forward. Therefore I shall not\\r\\nhave the pleasure, until this program shall materialize, of a personal\\r\\nacquaintance and a conference which would be of such interest and\\r\\nvalue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Eric Geddes replied: \"I am exceedingly grateful for your letter. As\\r\\nyou know we, all of us here, have great admiration for your officers and\\r\\nmen, and for the splendid help they are giving in European waters.\\r\\nFurther, we find Admiral Sims invaluable in council and in co-operation.\\r\\nI fully appreciate how onerous your office must be and much though I\\r\\nregret that you do not see your way to visiting this country in the near\\r\\nfuture, I hope we may some day have the pleasure of welcoming you here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Eric afterward himself visited the United States and his visit was\\r\\nmade the occasion of a general expression of the high regard which the\\r\\nUnited States felt for the splendid assistance which the great British\\r\\nNavy had rendered in convoying its armies across the seas.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecretary Daniels, in his report of December, 1918, said that American\\r\\nsea forces in European waters comprised 338 vessels, with 75,000 men and\\r\\nofficers--a force larger than the entire Navy was before the war began.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom August, 1914, to September, 1918, German submarines sank 7,151,088\\r\\ndeadweight tons of shipping in excess of the tonnage turned out in that\\r\\nperiod by the allied and neutral nations. That total does not represent\\r\\nthe depletion of the fleets at the command of the allied and neutral\\r\\nnations, however, as 3,795,000 deadweight tons of enemy ships were\\r\\nseized in the meantime. Actually, the allied and neutral nations on\\r\\nSeptember 1, 1918, had only 3,362,088 less tons of shipping in operation\\r\\nthan in August, 1914.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese details of the shipping situation were issued by the United States\\r\\nShipping Board along with figures to show that, with American and allied\\r\\nyards under full headway, Europe\\'s danger of being starved by the German\\r\\nsubmarine was apparently at an end. The United States took the lead of\\r\\nall nations in shipbuilding.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn all, the allied and neutral nations lost 21,404,913 deadweight tons\\r\\nof shipping since the beginning of the war, showing that Germany\\r\\nmaintained an average destruction of about 445,000 deadweight tons\\r\\nmonthly. During the latter months, however, the sinkings fell\\r\\nconsiderably below the average, and allied construction passed\\r\\ndestruction for the first time in May, 1918.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe losses of the allied and neutral shipping in August, 1918, amounted\\r\\nto 327,676 gross tonnage, of which 176,401 was British and 151,275\\r\\nallied and neutral, as compared with the adjusted figures for July of\\r\\n323,772, and 182,524 and 141,248, respectively. British losses from all\\r\\ncauses during August were 10,887 tons higher than in June, which was the\\r\\nlowest month since the introduction of unrestricted submarine warfare.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn official statement of the United States Shipping Board, issued\\r\\nSeptember 21, 1918, set forth the following facts:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSTATUS OF WORLD TONNAGE, SEPTEMBER 1, 1918\\r\\n(Germany and Austria excluded)\\r\\n                                     Deadweight\\r\\n                                                           Tons\\r\\nTotal losses (allied and neutral)\\r\\n                August, 1914-September 1, 1918           21,404,913\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal construction (allied and neutral)\\r\\n                August, 1914-September 1, 1918           14,247,825\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal enemy tonnage captured (to end of 1917)             3,795,000\\r\\n\\r\\nExcess of losses over gains                               3,362,088\\r\\n\\r\\nEstimated normal increase in world\\'s tonnage\\r\\nif war had not occurred\\r\\n(based on rate of increase, 1905-1914)                   14,700,000\\r\\n\\r\\nNet deficit due to war                                   18,062,088\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August, deliveries to the Shipping Board and other seagoing\\r\\nconstruction in the United States for private parties passed allied and\\r\\nneutral destruction for that month.

(Lloyd\\'s Register.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe climax to Germany\\'s piratical submarine adventure took place a few\\r\\ndays after the armistice, when a mournful procession of\\r\\nshamefaced-looking U-boats sailed between lines of English cruisers to\\r\\nbe handed over to the tender mercies of the Allied governments.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXVI\\r\\n\\r\\nCHINA JOINS THE FIGHTING DEMOCRACIES\\r\\n\\r\\nThe circumstances connected with the entrance of the Republic of China\\r\\ninto the World War were as follows: On February 4, 1917, the American\\r\\nMinister, Dr. Reinsch, requested the Chinese Government to follow the\\r\\nUnited States in protesting against the German use of the submarine\\r\\nagainst neutral ships. On February 9th Pekin made such a protest to\\r\\nGermany, and declared its intention of severing diplomatic relations if\\r\\nthe protest were ineffectual. The immediate answer of Germany was to\\r\\ntorpedo the French ship Atlas in the Mediterranean on which were over\\r\\nseven hundred Chinese laborers. On March 10th the Chinese Parliament\\r\\nempowered the government to break with Germany. On the same afternoon a\\r\\nreply was received from the German Government to the Chinese protest, of\\r\\na very mild character. The reply produced a great deal of surprise in\\r\\nChina.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Chinese statesman made this comment on the German change of attitude:\\r\\n\"The troops under Count Waldersee leaving Germany for the relief of\\r\\nPekin were instructed by the War Lord to grant no quarter to the\\r\\nChinese. On the other hand, the latter were to be so disciplined that\\r\\nthey would never dare look a German in the face again. The whirligig of\\r\\ntime brings its own revenge, and today, after the lapse of scarcely\\r\\nseventeen years, we hear the Vossiche Zeitung commenting on the\\r\\ndiplomatic rupture between China and Germany, lamenting that even so\\r\\nweak a state as the Far Eastern Republic dares look defiantly at the\\r\\nGerman nation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe breaking off of relations with Germany led to trouble between the\\r\\nPresident of the Republic and the Premier. The Premier desired to break\\r\\noff relations without consulting Parliament. The President insisted that\\r\\nParliament should be consulted, which was actually done. The next move\\r\\nwas to declare war, but here the Chinese statesmen hesitated, and their\\r\\nhesitation arose through their feeling toward Japan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey sympathized with the Allies, but to Chinese eyes Japan has stood\\r\\nfor all that Germany, as depicted by its worst enemies, stood for. The\\r\\nJapanese Government was professing friendliness to China, but that\\r\\nprofession the Chinese could not reconcile with Japan\\'s action in the\\r\\nChino-Japanese War, and on many other occasions since that war. In\\r\\nChinese hearts there was a strong feeling of distrust, fear and hatred\\r\\nfor their Japanese neighbor. There were other reasons also why they\\r\\nhesitated to declare war. Indeed the devotion to peace, which is\\r\\ndeep-rooted in the nation, would be a sufficient reason in itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, China, like other neutral nations, was a strong center for\\r\\nGerman propaganda. German consuls and diplomatic officers, who were\\r\\nscholars in Chinese literature and philosophy, and who also had\\r\\nsufficient funds to entertain Chinese officials as they liked to be\\r\\nentertained, were actively endeavoring to influence Chinese statesmen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chinese Government, however, was determined to declare war, and to\\r\\nsecure support the Chinese Premier summoned a council of military\\r\\ngovernors to consider the question. The majority of the conference\\r\\nagreed with the Premier, but a vigorous opposition began to develop. On\\r\\nMay 7th the President sent a formal request to Parliament to approve of\\r\\na declaration of war. Parliament delayed and was threatened by a mob.\\r\\nThe Premier was accused of having instigated the riot and support began\\r\\nto gather for Parliament, and an attack was made on the Premier as being\\r\\nwilling to sell China.\\r\\n\\r\\nDay by day the differences between the militants and democrats became\\r\\nmore bitter. The question of war was almost lost in the differences of\\r\\nopinion as to the comparative powers of Parliament and the Executive. A\\r\\ndemand was made that the Premier resign. He refused to resign and was\\r\\ndismissed from office by the President, who was supported in his action\\r\\nby the Parliament. This was practically a success of the Parliamentary\\r\\nparty, when suddenly several of the northern generals and governors\\r\\ndeclared their independence, and the movement gradually developed into a\\r\\nrevolution in favor of the restoration of the Manchu Dynasty. This\\r\\nrevolution was finally suppressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Japanese declared themselves, not the enemies, but the protectors of\\r\\nChina in terms that suggested the appearance of a Monroe Doctrine for\\r\\nAsia. They pledged themselves not to violate the political independence\\r\\nor territorial integrity of China, and declared strongly in favor of the\\r\\nprinciple of the open door and equal opportunity.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 14th China formally joined the Allies and declared war on\\r\\nAustria and Germany. She took no great part in the war, except to invade\\r\\nthe German and Austrian settlements in Tientsin and Hankow, which were\\r\\ntaken over by the Chinese authorities. The Chinese officials also seized\\r\\nthe Deutsche Asiatiche Bank which had been the financing agent in China\\r\\nfor the German Government, and fourteen German vessels which had been\\r\\ninterned in Chinese ports. Thousands of Chinese coolies were sent to\\r\\nEurope to work in the Allied interests behind the battle lines, and\\r\\nChina has in all respects been faithful to her pledges.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe official war proclamation of China which was signed by President\\r\\nFeng-kuo-chang reviewed China\\'s efforts to induce Germany to modify her\\r\\nsubmarine policy. It declared that China had been forced to sever\\r\\nrelations with Germany and with Austro-Hungary to protect the lives and\\r\\nproperty of Chinese citizens. It promised that China would respect the\\r\\nHague Convention, regarding the humane conduct of the war, and asserted\\r\\nthat China\\'s object was to hasten peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 22d Siam officially entered the war and all German and Austrian\\r\\nsubjects were interned and German ships seized. The Prince of Songkla,\\r\\nbrother of the reigning monarch, declared that natural necessity and\\r\\nmoral pressure forced Siam into the war on the side of the Entente.\\r\\nNeutrality had become increasingly difficult, and it had become apparent\\r\\nthat freedom and justice in states which were not strong from a military\\r\\nstandpoint were not to be secured through the policy of the Central\\r\\nPowers. Sympathy for Belgium and the popular aversion to Teutonic\\r\\nmethods had left no doubt as to the duty of Siam. The motive of Siam had\\r\\na curious fitness, though there was a certain quaintness in her\\r\\nexpression of a desire to make, \"the world safe for democracy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe native name of Siam is Muang-Thai, which means the Kingdom of the\\r\\nFree. Siam is about as large as France, and has a population of about\\r\\neight millions. Its people, who are of many shades of yellowish-brown,\\r\\nhave descended into this corner of Asia from the highlands north of\\r\\nBurma and east of Tibet. The tradition among these people was that the\\r\\nfurther south they descended the shorter they would grow, that when they\\r\\nreached the southern plains they would be no larger than rabbits, and\\r\\nthat when they came to the sea they would vanish altogether. As a fact\\r\\nthe northern tribes are much taller than the southern.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original population of the Siamese peninsula was a race of black\\r\\ndwarfs, remnants of whom still dwell in caves and nests of palm leaves,\\r\\nso shy that it is almost impossible to catch a glimpse of them. The\\r\\nliterary and religious culture of Siam comes mainly from southern India.\\r\\nBuddhism is the dominant religion, but there are many Mohammedans also.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe accession of Siam to the ranks of the Allies did not make any great\\r\\ndifference from a military point of view, but it was another evidence of\\r\\nthe general world feeling with regard to the Germans and their\\r\\nencroachments in all parts of the world. Germany had tried its best to\\r\\nkeep these nations from participation in the war, but not only had her\\r\\npropaganda failed but the feeling of these Oriental peoples was strongly\\r\\nanti-German. Much of this feeling, it is readily seen from their\\r\\nstatements and their private letters, comes from a personal resentment\\r\\nof the boorish attitude of the individual German. By the end of 1918 the\\r\\nTeuton influence in the Orient had completely disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXVII\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE DEFEAT AND RECOVERY OF ITALY\\r\\n\\r\\nNone of the surprises of the World War brought such sudden and stunning\\r\\ndismay to the Entente Allies as the news of the Italian disaster\\r\\nbeginning October 24, 1917, and terminating in mid-November. It is a\\r\\nstory in which propaganda was an important factor. It taught the Allies\\r\\nthe dangers lying in fraternization between opposing armies.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the summer of 1917 the second Italian army was confronted by\\r\\nAustrian regiments composed largely of war-weary Socialists. During that\\r\\nsummer skilful German propagandists operating from Spain had sown the\\r\\nseeds of pacificism throughout Italy. This was made easy by the distress\\r\\nthen existing particularly in the villages where food was scanty and\\r\\ncomplaints against the conduct of the war were numerous. The propaganda\\r\\nextended from the civilian population to the army, and its channel was\\r\\ndirected mainly toward the second army encamped along the Isonzo River.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a consequence of the pacifists\\' preachments both by word of mouth and\\r\\ndocument, the second army was ready for the friendly approaches that\\r\\ncame from the front lines of the Austrians only a few hundred yards\\r\\naway. Daily communication was established and at night the opposing\\r\\nsoldiers fraternized generally. The Russian doctrine that an end of the\\r\\nfighting would come if the soldiers agreed to do no more shooting,\\r\\nspread throughout the Italian trenches.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was all part of a plan carefully mapped out by the German High\\r\\nCommand. When the infection had spread, the fraternizing Austrian troops\\r\\nwere withdrawn from the front trenches and German shock troops took\\r\\ntheir places.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 24th these troops attacked in force. The Italians in the\\r\\nfront line, mistaking them for the friendly Austrians, waved a greeting.\\r\\nGerman machine guns and rifles replied with a deadly fire, and the great\\r\\nflanking movement commenced. So well had the Germans played their game\\r\\nthe Italians lost more than 250,000 prisoners and 2,300 guns in the\\r\\nfirst week. The attack began in the Julian Alps and continued along the\\r\\nIsonzo southwestward into the plain of Venice. The Italian positions at\\r\\nTolmino and Plezzo were captured and the whole Italian force was\\r\\ncompelled to retreat along a seventy-mile front from the Carnic Alps to\\r\\nthe sea. The most important point gained by the enemy in its early\\r\\nassault was the village of Caporetto on the Upper Isonzo where General\\r\\nCadorna held a great series of dams which could have drained the Isonzo\\r\\nRiver dry within twelve hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map]\\r\\n  AREA OF THE FLOW AND EBB OF ITALY\\'S MILITARY SUCCESS FROM THE CARSO\\r\\n  PLATEAU TO THE PIAVE LINE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Italian retreat at places degenerated into a rout and it was not\\r\\nuntil the Italians, reinforced by French and British, reached the Piave\\r\\nRiver, that a stand was finally made. The defeat cost Cadorna his\\r\\ncommand, and he was succeeded by General Armando Diaz, whose brilliant\\r\\nstrategy during the remainder of the war marked him as a national hero\\r\\nand one of the outstanding military geniuses of the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe order for a general retreat was issued on October 27th. Poison gas\\r\\nshells rained blindness and death upon the retreating Italians and upon\\r\\nthe heroic rear-guards. The city of Udine and its environs were emptied\\r\\nof their inhabitants; and Goritzia, which had been wrested after a\\r\\ndesperate effort from the Austrians, was retaken on October 28th.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat the entire Italian army escaped the fate that had come to the\\r\\nRussians at the Masurian Lakes was due mainly to the third army\\r\\ncommanded by the Duke of Aosta. During the long running fight, it faced\\r\\nabout from time to time and drove the Germans back in bloody encounters.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy November 10th the Italian forces had come to the hastily prepared\\r\\nentrenchments on the west bank of the Piave River. The Austrians and the\\r\\nGermans dug in on the east bank from the village of Susegana in the\\r\\nAlpine foothills to the Adriatic Sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere a long-drawn-out battle was fought, resulting in enormous losses to\\r\\nthe Germans and Austrians. By this time reinforcements had come up from\\r\\nthe French front and every attempt by the enemy to gain ground met a\\r\\nbloody check. The hardest fighting was on the Asiago Plateau. There,\\r\\nalthough the Italians were greatly outnumbered, the concentration of\\r\\ntheir artillery in the hills overlooking the great field completely\\r\\ndominated the situation.\\r\\n\\r\\nA factor that was of the utmost value in checking the Austrians was the\\r\\nsystem of lagoon defenses running from the lower Piave to the Gulf of\\r\\nVenice.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom November 13th, when the Austrians in crossing the lower Piave in\\r\\ntheir headlong rush to Venice were suddenly checked by the Italian\\r\\nlagoon defenses, the entire Gulf of Venice, with its endless canals and\\r\\nmarshes, with islands disappearing and reappearing with the tide, was\\r\\nthe scene of a continuous battle. A correspondent described the fighting\\r\\nas absolutely without precedent. The Teutons were desperately trying to\\r\\nturn the Italian right wing by working their way around the northern\\r\\nlimits of the Venetian Gulf. The Italians inundated the region and\\r\\nsealed all the entrances into the gulf by mine fields. The gulf,\\r\\ntherefore, was converted into an isolated sea. Over this inland waterway\\r\\nthe conflict raged bitterly. The Italians had a \"lagoon fleet\" ranging\\r\\nfrom the swiftest of motor boats, armed with machine guns, small cannon,\\r\\nand torpedo tubes, to huge, cumbersome, flat-bottomed British monitors,\\r\\nmounting the biggest guns.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Italian vessels navigated secret channels dug in the bottom of the\\r\\nshallow lagoons. Only the Italian war pilots knew these courses. Even\\r\\ngondolas straying out of the channels were instantly and hopelessly\\r\\nstranded. Not only this, but as the muddy flats and marshy islands did\\r\\nnot permit of artillery emplacements the Italians developed an immense\\r\\nfleet of floating batteries. The guns ranged from three-inch fieldpieces\\r\\nto great fifteen-inch monsters. Each was camouflaged to represent a tiny\\r\\nisland, a garden patch, or a houseboat. Floating on the glasslike\\r\\nsurface of the lagoons, the guns fired a few shots and then changed\\r\\nposition, making it utterly impossible for the enemy to locate them. The\\r\\nentire auxiliary service of supplying this floating army was adapted to\\r\\nmeet the lagoon warfare. Munition dumps were on boats, constantly moved\\r\\nabout to prevent the enemy spotting them. Gondolas and motor boats\\r\\nreplaced the automobile supply lorries customary in land warfare.\\r\\nInstead of motor ambulances, motor boats carried off the dead and\\r\\nwounded. Hydro-airplanes replaced ordinary fighting aircraft.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong the northern limit of the Venetian Gulf, where the Austrians,\\r\\nhaving filtered into the Piave Delta, sought to cross both the Sile and\\r\\nthe Piave, the enemy each night hooked up pontoons. At daybreak every\\r\\nmorning one end of a huge pontoon structure was anchored to the east\\r\\nbank of the Piave and the other flung out to the strong current, which\\r\\nsoon stretched the makeshift bridge across.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moment this happened, the enemy infantry madly dashed across.\\r\\nSimultaneously the Italian floating batteries opened a terrific fire.\\r\\nPractically every morning the Austrians tried the trick, and every\\r\\nmorning they failed, with heavy losses, to effect a crossing. At last\\r\\nthey gave up the attempt as hopeless, and the armies remained locked on\\r\\nthe Piave for several months.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\\r\\n\\r\\nREDEMPTION OF THE HOLY LAND\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the beginning of the war the German General Staff and the British\\r\\nWar Office planned the occupation of Palestine and Macedonia. Germany\\r\\nwanted domination of that territory because through it lay the open road\\r\\nto Egypt and British prestige in the East. Turkey was the cat\\'s paw of\\r\\nthe Hun in this enterprise. German officers and German guns were\\r\\nsupplied to the Turks, but the terrible privations necessary in a long\\r\\ncampaign that must be spent largely in the desert, and the inevitable\\r\\ngreat loss in human life, were both demanded from Turkey.\\r\\n\\r\\nGreat Britain made no such demands upon any of its Allies. Unflinchingly\\r\\nEngland faced virtually alone the rigors, the disease and the deaths\\r\\nconsequent upon an expedition having as its object the redemption of the\\r\\nHoly Land from the unspeakable Turk.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers for the expedition came by the thousands. Canada, the United\\r\\nStates, Australia and other countries furnished whole regiments of\\r\\nJewish youths eager for the campaign. The inspiration and the devotion\\r\\nradiating from Palestine, and particularly from Jerusalem and Bethlehem,\\r\\ndrew Jew and Gentile, hardy adventurer and zealous churchman, into\\r\\nAllenby\\'s great army.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a long campaign. On February 26, 1917, Kut-el-Amara was\\r\\nrecaptured from the Turks by the British expedition under command of\\r\\nGeneral Sir Stanley Maude, and on March 11th following General Maude\\r\\ncaptured Bagdad. From that time forward pressure upon the Turks was\\r\\ncontinuous. On September 29, 1917, the Turkish Mesopotamian army\\r\\ncommanded by Ahmad Bey was routed by the British, and historic Beersheba\\r\\nin Palestine was occupied on October 31st. The untimely death of General\\r\\nMaude, the hero of Mesopotamia, on November 18, 1917, temporarily cast\\r\\ngloom over the Allied forces but it had no deterrent effect upon their\\r\\nsuccessful operations. Siege was laid to Jerusalem and its environs late\\r\\nin November, and on December 8, 1917, the Holy City which had been held\\r\\nby the Turks for six hundred and seventy-three years surrendered to\\r\\nGeneral Allenby and his British army. Thus ended a struggle for\\r\\npossession of the holiest of shrines both of the Old and New Testaments,\\r\\nthat had cost millions of lives during fruitless crusades and had been\\r\\nthe center of religious aspirations for ages.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map: The Jordan river from the Sea of Galilee to the Dead\\r\\nSea.]\\r\\n  HOW THE TWO WINGS OF THE BRITISH ARMY TRAPPED THE TURKS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Allenby\\'s official report follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I entered the city officially at noon December 11th with a few of my\\r\\nstaff, the commanders of the French and Italian detachments, the heads\\r\\nof the political missions, and the military attaches of France, England,\\r\\nand America.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The procession was all afoot, and at Jaffa gate I was received by the\\r\\nguards representing England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Australia, New\\r\\nZealand, India, France and Italy. The population received me well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Guards have been placed over the holy places. My military governor is\\r\\nin contact with the acting custodians and the Latin and Greek\\r\\nrepresentatives. The governor has detailed an officer to supervise the\\r\\nholy places. The Mosque of Omar and the area around it have been placed\\r\\nunder Moslem control, and a military cordon of Mohammedan officers and\\r\\nsoldiers has been established around the mosque. Orders have been issued\\r\\nthat no non-Moslem is to pass within the cordon without permission of\\r\\nthe military governor and the Moslem in charge.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA proclamation in Arabic, Hebrew, English, French, Italian Greek and\\r\\nRussian was posted in the citadel, and on all the walls proclaiming\\r\\nmartial law and intimating that all the holy places would be maintained\\r\\nand protected according to the customs and beliefs of those to whose\\r\\nfaith they were sacred. The proclamation read:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPROCLAMATION\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the Inhabitants of Jerusalem the Blessed and the People Dwelling in\\r\\nIts Vicinity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe defeat inflicted upon the Turks by the troops under my command has\\r\\nresulted in the occupation of your city by my forces. I, therefore,\\r\\nproclaim it to be under martial law, under which form of administration\\r\\nit will remain so long as military consideration makes necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, lest any of you be alarmed by reason of your experience at the\\r\\nhands of the enemy who has retired, I hereby inform you that it is my\\r\\ndesire that every person should pursue his lawful business without fear\\r\\nof interruption.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, since your city is regarded with affection by the adherents\\r\\nof three of the great religions of mankind and its soil has been\\r\\nconsecrated by the prayers and pilgrimages of multitudes of devout\\r\\npeople of these three religions for many centuries, therefore, do I make\\r\\nit known to you that every sacred building, monument, holy spot, shrine,\\r\\ntraditional site, endowment, pious bequest, or customary place of prayer\\r\\nof whatsoever form of the three religions will be maintained and\\r\\nprotected according to the existing customs and beliefs of those to\\r\\nwhose faith they are sacred.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuardians have been established at Bethlehem and on Rachel\\'s Tomb. The\\r\\ntomb at Hebron has been placed under exclusive Moslem control.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hereditary custodians at the gates of the Holy Sepulchre have been\\r\\nrequested to take up their accustomed duties in remembrance of the\\r\\nmagnanimous act of the Caliph Omar, who protected that church.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJerusalem was now made the center of the British operations against the\\r\\nTurks in  Palestine. Mohammed V, the Sultan of Turkey, died July 3,\\r\\n1918, and many superstitious Turks looked upon that event as forecasting\\r\\nthe end of the Turkish Empire. The Turkish army in Palestine was left\\r\\nlargely to its fate by Germany and Austria, and although it was\\r\\nnumerically a formidable opponent for General Allenby\\'s forces, that\\r\\ndistinguished strategist fairly outmaneuvered the Turkish High Command\\r\\nin every encounter. The beginning of the end for Turkish misrule in\\r\\nPalestine came on September 20th when the ancient town of Nazareth was\\r\\ncaptured by the British.\\r\\n\\r\\nA military net was thereupon closed upon the Turkish army. The fortified\\r\\ntowns of Beisan and Afule followed the fate of Nazareth. In one day\\'s\\r\\nfighting 18,000 Turkish prisoners, 120 guns, four airplanes, a number of\\r\\nlocomotives and cars, and a great quantity of military and food supplies\\r\\nwere bagged by the victorious British. So well did Allenby plan that the\\r\\nBritish losses were far the smallest suffered in any large operation of\\r\\nthe entire war. It was the swiftest and most decisive victory of any\\r\\nscored by the Allies. It ended the grandiose dream of Germany for an\\r\\ninvasion of Egypt in stark disaster, and swept the Holy Land clear of\\r\\nthe Turks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis great battle on the Biblical field of Armageddon was remarkable in\\r\\nthat it was virtually the only engagement during the entire war offering\\r\\nthe freest scope to cavalry operations. British cavalry commands\\r\\noperated over a radius of sixty miles between the Jordan and the\\r\\nMediterranean, sweeping the Turks before them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy September 25th the total bag of Turkish prisoners exceeded 40,000.\\r\\nMunition depots covering acres of ground were taken. Whole companies of\\r\\nTurkish soldiers were found sitting on their white flags waiting for the\\r\\nBritish to accept their terms. Two hundred sixty-five pieces of\\r\\nartillery were captured.\\r\\n\\r\\nDamascus was captured on Tuesday, October 1st, after an advance of 130\\r\\nmiles by General Allenby since September 1st, the day of his surprise\\r\\nattack north of Jerusalem. During that period a total of 73,000\\r\\nprisoners was captured.\\r\\n\\r\\nPalestine\\'s delivery from the Turks was complete. Official announcement\\r\\nwas made by the British War Office that the total casualties from all\\r\\nsources in this final campaign was less than 4,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlans for the government of the people of Palestine were announced\\r\\nimmediately. Their general scope was outlined in an agreement made\\r\\nbetween the British, French and Russian governments in 1916. Under that\\r\\narrangement Republican France was charged with the preparation of a\\r\\nscheme of self-government. The town of Alexandretta was fixed upon as a\\r\\nfree port of entry for the new nation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph]\\r\\n  Copyright Underwood and Underwood, N. Y.

The roads were\\r\\nalready so crowded by what the Allies had done in purchasing war\\r\\nsupplies, that a great deal of confusion had resulted. The Allies had\\r\\nexpended more than three billion dollars in the United States, and as\\r\\nnearly all of their purchases had to be sent to a few definite points\\r\\nfor shipment to Europe, the congestion at those points had become a\\r\\nserious difficulty. Thousands of loaded cars had to stand for long\\r\\nperiods awaiting the transfer of their contents to ships. This meant\\r\\nthat thousands of cars which had been taken from lines in other parts of\\r\\nthe country would be in a traffic blockade for weeks at a time. The main\\r\\ndifficulty appeared to be that of getting trains unloaded promptly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe declaration of war by the United States made the situation very much\\r\\nworse. Not only did the railroads have to handle the freight destined\\r\\nfor the Allies, but there was a very large addition to the passenger\\r\\nmovement on account of the thousands of men that were being sent to the\\r\\nvarious training camps, and the immense masses of supplies that had to\\r\\nbe sent to these camps. This included not only the ordinary supplies to\\r\\nthe men but thousands of carloads of lumber. Moreover, all over the\\r\\ncountry mills and factories were now being handed over to the government\\r\\nfor war work; and to them, too, great quantities of raw material had to\\r\\nbe sent, and the finished product removed to its destination.\\r\\n\\r\\nA vigorous endeavor to meet the new difficulties was instituted by the\\r\\nrailroads themselves. They themselves named a war board, which was to\\r\\nco-operate with the government and which was to have absolute authority.\\r\\nBut this arrangement soon proved unsatisfactory. Each government\\r\\nofficial would do his best to obtain preference for what his department\\r\\nrequired, and to obtain that preference a system of priority tags was\\r\\nestablished which became a great abuse. The result was that priority\\r\\nfreight soon began to crowd out the freight which the railroads could\\r\\nhandle according to their own discretion, thus seriously interfering\\r\\nwith business all over the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nNaturally, the railroad executives and the government authorities\\r\\nstudied the question with the greatest care, but they could not reach an\\r\\nunderstanding among themselves, nor with the Administration. At last the\\r\\nPresident settled the matter by announcing his decision to have the\\r\\ngovernment take over complete control of the roads. The President\\r\\nderived his power from an Act of Congress dated August 29, 1916, which\\r\\nreads as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President in time of war is empowered, through the Secretary of War,\\r\\nto take possession and assume control of any system or systems of\\r\\ntransportation, or any part thereof, and to utilize the same to the\\r\\nexclusion, as far as may be necessary, of all other traffic thereon, for\\r\\nthe transfer or transportation of troops, war material and equipment, or\\r\\nfor such other purposes connected with the emergency as may be needful\\r\\nor desirable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proclamation went into effect on December 28, 1917, and the\\r\\nPresident declared that it applied to \"each and every system of\\r\\ntransportation and the appurtenances thereof, located, wholly or in\\r\\npart, within the boundaries of the Continental United States, and\\r\\nconsisting of railroads and owned or controlled systems of coastwise and\\r\\ninland transportation, engaged in general transportation, whether\\r\\noperated by steam, or by electric power, including also terminals,\\r\\nterminal companies, and terminal associations, sleeping and parlor cars,\\r\\nprivate cars, and private car lines, elevators, warehouses, telegraph\\r\\nand telephone lines, and all other equipment and appurtenances commonly\\r\\nused upon or operated as a part of such rail or combined rail and water\\r\\nsystems of transportation.... That the possession, control, operation,\\r\\nand utilization of such transportation systems shall be exercised by and\\r\\nthrough William G. McAdoo, who is hereby appointed, and designated\\r\\nDirector General of Railroads. Said Director may perform the duties\\r\\nimposed upon him so long and to such an extent as he shall determine\\r\\nthrough the boards of directors, receivers, officers and employees, of\\r\\nsaid system of transportation.\" President Wilson issued an explanation\\r\\nwith this proclamation in which he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a war of resources no less than of men, perhaps even more than\\r\\nof men, and it is necessary for the complete mobilization of our\\r\\nresources that the transportation systems of the country should be\\r\\norganized and employed under a single authority and to simplify methods\\r\\nfor coordination which have not proved possible under private management\\r\\nand control. A committee of railway executives who have been cooperating\\r\\nwith the government in this all-important matter, have done the utmost\\r\\nthat it was possible for them to do, but there were differences that\\r\\nthey could neither escape nor neutralize. Complete unity of\\r\\nadministration in the present circumstances involves upon occasion, and\\r\\nat many points, a serious dislocation of earnings, and the committee\\r\\nwas, of course, without power or authority to rearrange charges or\\r\\neffect proper compensations in adjustments of earnings. Several roads\\r\\nwhich were willingly and with admirable public spirit accepting the\\r\\norders of the committee, have already suffered from these circumstances,\\r\\nand should not be required to suffer further. In mere fairness to them,\\r\\nthe full authority of the government must be substituted. The public\\r\\ninterest must be first served, and in addition the financial interests\\r\\nof the government, and the financial interests of the railways, must be\\r\\nbrought under a common direction. The financial operations of the\\r\\nrailway need not, then, interfere with the borrowings of the government,\\r\\nand they themselves can be conducted at a great advantage. Investors in\\r\\nrailway securities may rest assured that their rights and interests will\\r\\nbe as scrupulously looked after by the government as they could be by\\r\\nthe directors of the several railway systems. Immediately upon the\\r\\nreassembling of Congress I shall recommend that these different\\r\\nguarantees be given. The Secretary of War and I are agreed that, all the\\r\\ncircumstances being taken into consideration, the best results can be\\r\\nobtained under the immediate executive direction of the Honorable\\r\\nWilliam G. McAdoo, whose practical experience peculiarly fits him for\\r\\nthe service, and whose authority as Secretary of the Treasury will\\r\\nenable him to coordinate, as no other man could, the many financial\\r\\ninterests which will be involved, and which might, unless systematically\\r\\ndirected, suffer very embarrassing entanglements.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Wilson\\'s proclamation stirred up great excitement on the stock\\r\\nmarket. Speculators rushed to buy back railroad stocks which they had\\r\\npreviously sold short, and the market value of such stocks was raised\\r\\nmore than three hundred and fifty million dollars as a result. The\\r\\nFederal Government\\'s assumption of control of the railroads was\\r\\ngenerally recognized as the proper act under existing circumstances, and\\r\\nthe guarantee of pre-war earnings made them a good investment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe railroad system in the United States consists of 260,000 miles of\\r\\nrailroad, owned by 441 distinct corporations, with about 650,000\\r\\nshareholders. It employs 1,600,000 men and represents a property\\r\\ninvestment of $17,500,000,000. The outstanding capital in round numbers\\r\\nis $16,000,000,000, $9,000,000,000 of which is represented by a funded\\r\\ndebt. The rolling stock comprises 61,000 locomotives, 2,250,000 freight\\r\\ncars, 52,000 passenger cars and 95,000 service cars. All this was now\\r\\nunder the charge of William G. McAdoo. On January 4, 1918, President\\r\\nWilson explained his plan to Congress, and recommended legislation to\\r\\nput the new system of control into effect, and to guarantee to the\\r\\nholders of railroad stocks and bonds a net annual income equal to the\\r\\naverage net income for the three years ending June 30, 1917.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wise recommendations of President Wilson were at once approved by\\r\\nCongress; provision was made for guaranteeing the railroads the income\\r\\nwhich he recommended, and for financing the roads. The railroads\\' war\\r\\nboard was abolished and Mr. McAdoo appointed an advisory board to assist\\r\\nhim. This board consisted of John Skelton Williams, Controller of the\\r\\nCurrency; Hale Holden, President of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy\\r\\nRailroad; Henry Walters, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the\\r\\nAtlantic Coast Line; Edward Chambers, Vice-President of the Santa Fe\\r\\nRailroad and head of the transportation division of the United States\\r\\nFood Administration; Walter D. Hines, Chairman of the Executive\\r\\nCommittee of the Santa Fe. Specific duties were assigned to the various\\r\\nmembers of this committee. Mr. Williams was to deal with the financial\\r\\nproblem; Mr. Holden to assume direction of committees and\\r\\nsub-committees, and other phases of the work were allotted to other\\r\\nmembers. Mr. Walter D. Hines was made assistant to the Director General.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. McAdoo\\'s first order was to pool all terminals, ports, locomotives,\\r\\nrolling stock and other transportation facilities. Another order had as\\r\\nits object to end the congestion of traffic in New York City and\\r\\nChicago. It gave all lines entering these centers equal rights in\\r\\ntrackage and water terminal facilities. This wiped out the identity of\\r\\nthe great Pennsylvania Terminal Station in New York, and gave all\\r\\nrailroads the use of the Pennsylvania tubes under the Hudson River.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe effect of government control of the railroads was felt from the very\\r\\nfirst. Coal was given the right of way, giving great relief to such\\r\\nsections as were suffering from fuel shortage. Many passenger trains\\r\\nwere taken off, more than two hundred and fifty of such trains being\\r\\ndropped from the schedules of the eastern roads. This permitted a great\\r\\nincrease in the freight traffic. Orders were also given that all empty\\r\\nbox cars were to be sent to wheat-producing centers, so that wheat could\\r\\nbe moved to the Atlantic sea coasts for shipment to England and France.\\r\\nThese orders preceded the adoption of the railroad control bill, which\\r\\nwas not passed by Congress until March 14th. A feature of the bill is\\r\\nthe proviso that government control of the railroads shall not continue\\r\\nmore than twenty-one months after the war. After the passing of the\\r\\nbill plans were made to make contracts with each railroad company for\\r\\ngovernment compensation on the basis provided in the bill.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe action of the government in thus assuming control of the railroads\\r\\nvery naturally led to wide differences of opinion, some of which were\\r\\nsharply expressed in the Congress of the United States. On the whole,\\r\\nhowever, public opinion decided that the government acted wisely.\\r\\nCertain inconveniences to the traveling public were easily excused when\\r\\nit was realized that the movement of troops throughout the country to\\r\\nthe camps, or from the camps to the ports which were to take them across\\r\\nthe sea, from \"Texas to Toul,\" was being accomplished with great\\r\\nsuccess; that the movement of war material was now possible, and that\\r\\nthe gigantic railroad system was working without a hitch.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany details, in connection with the railroad management, were not at\\r\\nonce worked out, and many months passed without complete agreements\\r\\nregarding the railway operating contracts. But this was a matter of\\r\\ngreater interest to the owners than it was to patriotic citizens,\\r\\nanxious for the winning of the war. Governmental control of the\\r\\nrailroads, was only a beginning. On July 16th President Wilson took\\r\\ncontrol, for the period of the war, of all telegraph, telephone, cable\\r\\nand radio lines, signing a bill on that day passed by Congress\\r\\nauthorizing such action.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe transportation of the American army across the ocean was the\\r\\ngreatest military feat of its kind ever accomplished in history. The\\r\\ntransportation of English troops during the Boer War meant a longer\\r\\njourney, but the number of troops sent on that journey was but a small\\r\\nfraction of America\\'s army.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe railroads in existence were not sufficient. The ships that were\\r\\nnecessary could not be found in America\\'s navy. It was necessary to\\r\\nbuild new roads, new docks, new terminals, new bases of supplies in\\r\\nAmerica, and to send abroad thousands of trained workmen and experienced\\r\\nrailroad engineers to build similar necessities in France. To convey the\\r\\nmillions of men across the water England had to come to the rescue, and\\r\\nthough hundreds of American ships were built with a speed that was\\r\\nalmost miraculous, they were in constant need of the assistance of the\\r\\nAllies. But wonderful men were put in charge of the work, wonderful\\r\\norganizers with wonderful assistants, and the great task was\\r\\naccomplished.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as the army was trained it was sent across--first by thousands,\\r\\nthen by tens of thousands, then by hundreds of thousands, until before\\r\\nthe war was over more than two million men had made the great trip \"over\\r\\nthere.\" And throughout that whole trip they were watched over as\\r\\ncarefully as if they were at home. Every want was supplied; food,\\r\\nclothing, munitions were all where they were needed. Even their leisure\\r\\nhours were looked after, their health attended to. Books, games,\\r\\ntheaters, classes for those who cared to study, all were there.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a wonderful performance, and the whole movement was conducted\\r\\nwith clock-like precision. On such a day at such an hour the trained\\r\\nsoldier would start. At such an hour he would report in some Atlantic\\r\\nport. At such an hour and such a minute he would board ship, and with\\r\\nequal precision that ship would sail upon the appointed moment. Perhaps\\r\\non the journey over some submarine might delay the ship, but the\\r\\ndestroyers were there on the alert, and the submarine was but an amusing\\r\\nepisode. On the other side the process was carried on with equal\\r\\nefficiency. Before the American doughboy could realize that he was in\\r\\nFrance he was in his quarters, just like home, in the base camps behind\\r\\nthe fighting line and it was this miracle of transportation that won the\\r\\nwar.\\r\\n\\r\\nA study of transportation construction in other countries showed that\\r\\nactual construction of railroads had been suspended in some cases, and\\r\\nin others retarded, but in not a few instances hastened by the war.\\r\\nBrazil experienced a more nearly complete suspension of railroad\\r\\nbuilding than any of the other countries, but preparation was made for\\r\\nprompt resumption of construction, with the return of more normal\\r\\nconditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chinese building program also had been affected unfavorably by the\\r\\nwar. Nevertheless, there were important additions made, aggregating\\r\\napproximately 800 miles during the war. Of the lines completed in 1917,\\r\\ntwo are of especial significance. One of these, a 140-mile section of\\r\\nthe Canton-Hankow line, a link in the route between South China and\\r\\nPeking. The other is a 60-mile feeder of the Trans-Siberian Railway in\\r\\nManchuria. A line was extended from South Manchuria into Mongolia, the\\r\\nfirst railroad to penetrate this territory. Financial arrangements were\\r\\nmade for the early construction of a line across Southern Manchuria and\\r\\nfor another connecting the Peking-Hankow and Tientsin-Pukow lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nConstruction in Siberia proceeded rapidly. The completion, in 1915, of\\r\\nthe Amur River division of the Trans-Siberian in the east, together with\\r\\nthe extension in 1913 of the Ekaterinburg-Tiumen line to Omsk in the\\r\\nwest, gave virtually a double track from European Russia to Vladivostok.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe notable achievement in Africa was the continuation of the southern\\r\\nrail link in the Cape-to-Cairo route. This line was completed to Bukama\\r\\non the navigable Congo, 2,600 miles from Capetown. The railway in German\\r\\nEast Africa, was extended to Lake Tanganyika on the eve of the war,\\r\\nmaking a rail-water line across the center of the continent. The\\r\\nrailroad from Lobito Bay was extended eastward to Katanga, a rich\\r\\nmineral region of the Belgian Congo, and, with the road already reaching\\r\\nthe Indian Ocean at Beira, gave a second east and west transcontinental\\r\\nline. A permanent standard gauge railroad was laid by the British\\r\\nExpeditionary Forces from Egypt into Palestine.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the magnitude of the Australian contribution to the Allied\\r\\nmilitary and naval forces, the east and west transcontinental railway,\\r\\nbegun in 1912, was completed in 1917. In all, more than 3,500 miles of\\r\\ntrack were built in the commonwealth in the years 1915-17.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Canada, the work of providing two transcontinental railroads was\\r\\ncompleted; feeders were added, and a line from La Pas to Hudson Bay was\\r\\nunder construction. From 1912 to 1916 more than 10,000 miles of track\\r\\nwere put in operation, nearly 7,000 of which were added in the first two\\r\\nyears of the war.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XL\\r\\n\\r\\nSHIPS AND THE MEN WHO MADE THEM.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the United States of America entered the World War she was\\r\\nconfronted at once by a serious question. The great Allied nations were\\r\\nstruggling against the attempt of the Germans, through the piratical use\\r\\nof submarines, to blockade the coast of the Allied countries. It was\\r\\nthis German action which had led America to take part in the war. It is\\r\\ntrue that America had other motives. Few wars ever take place among\\r\\ndemocratic nations as a result of the calculation of the nation\\'s\\r\\nleaders. The people must be interested, and the people must sympathize\\r\\nwith the cause for which they are going to fight. The people of America\\r\\nhad sympathized with Belgium, and had become indignant at the brutal\\r\\ntreatment of that inoffensive nation. They had sympathized with France\\r\\nin its gallant endeavor to protect its soil from the inroads of the Hun.\\r\\nThis feeling had become a personal one as they reviewed the lists of\\r\\nAmericans lost in the sinking of the Lusitania, and this sympathy had\\r\\ngradually grown into indignation when the Germans, after having promised\\r\\nto conduct submarine warfare according to international law, again and\\r\\nagain violated that promise. When, then, the Germans declared that they\\r\\nwould no longer even pretend to treat neutral shipping according to the\\r\\nlaws of maritime warfare the people with one accord approved the action\\r\\nof the President of the United States in declaring war. The Germans at\\r\\nthis time were making a desperate effort to starve England, by\\r\\ndestroying its commerce, and it was in the endeavor to accomplish this\\r\\npurpose that they thought it necessary to attack American ships.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first effort of Americans, therefore, was naturally to use every\\r\\npower of the navy to destroy the lurking submarines, and in the second\\r\\nplace to use every means in their power to supply the Allies with food.\\r\\nBut America had for many years neglected to give encouragement to her\\r\\nmerchant fleets. Her commerce was very largely carried in foreign\\r\\nbottoms.\\r\\n\\r\\nShips were needed, and needed urgently, and one of the very first acts\\r\\nof the American Government was to authorize their production. Congress\\r\\ntherefore appropriated for this purpose what was then the extraordinary\\r\\nsum of $1,135,000,000 and General Goethals, recently returned from his\\r\\nwork in building the Panama Canal, was appointed manager of the\\r\\nEmergency Fleet Corporation and entrusted with the execution of the\\r\\ngovernment\\'s ship-building program.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Emergency Fleet Corporation, however, was then independent of the\\r\\nUnited States Shipping Board, of which Mr. William Denman was made\\r\\nchairman, and friction between General Goethals and Mr. Denman at the\\r\\nvery start caused long delay. The difference of opinion between them\\r\\narose over the comparative merits of wooden and steel ships. The matter\\r\\nwas finally laid before President Wilson and ended in the resignation of\\r\\nboth men and the complete reorganization of the board and the Fleet\\r\\nCorporation, in which reorganization the Fleet Corporation was made\\r\\nsubordinate to the Shipping Board but given entire control of\\r\\nconstruction.\\r\\n\\r\\nRear-Admiral Capps succeeded General Goethals, but was compelled to\\r\\nresign on account of ill health. Rear-Admiral Harris, who had been chief\\r\\nof the Navy\\'s Bureau of Yards and Docks, then had the job for two weeks,\\r\\nbut resigned because in his opinion he had not enough authority. Then\\r\\ncame Mr. Charles Piez, who held the position for a longer period. Mr.\\r\\nEdward N. Hurley had been made chairman of the United States Shipping\\r\\nBoard, and under the direction of these two men much progress was made.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the spring of 1918 the boards themselves were not satisfied with\\r\\ntheir progress, and on April 16, 1918, Mr. Charles M. Schwab, chairman\\r\\nof the Board of Directors of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, was made\\r\\nDirector General of the Emergency Fleet Corporation. Mr. Schwab was one\\r\\nof the most prominent business men in the United States and one of the\\r\\nbest known, and his appointment was received all over the country with\\r\\nthe greatest satisfaction. His wonderful work in building up the\\r\\nBethlehem steel plant not only showed his great ability, but especially\\r\\nfitted him for a task in which the steel industry bore such a vital\\r\\npart. The official statement issued from the White House read as\\r\\nfollows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward N. Hurley, Charles M. Schwab, Bainbridge Colby and Charles Piez\\r\\nwere received by the President at the White House today. It was stated\\r\\nthat the subject discussed was the progress and condition of a national\\r\\nship-building program. The carrying forward of the construction work in\\r\\nthe one hundred and thirty shipyards now in operation is so vast that it\\r\\nrequires a reinforcement of the ship-building organization throughout\\r\\nthe country. Later in the day Chairman Hurley of the Shipping Board\\r\\nannounced that a new office with wide powers had been created by the\\r\\nTrustees of the Emergency Fleet Corporation. The new position is that of\\r\\nDirector General and Mr. Schwab has been asked, and has agreed, to\\r\\naccept this position in answer to the call of the nation. Charles Piez,\\r\\nVice-President of the Emergency Fleet Corporation, recommended that the\\r\\npost of General Manager of the corporation be at once abolished, so that\\r\\nMr. Schwab as Director General should be wholly unhampered in carrying\\r\\non the large task entrusted to him. Mr. Piez, since the retirement of\\r\\nAdmiral Harris, has been filling both the position of Vice-President and\\r\\nthat of General Manager. Mr. Schwab will have complete supervision and\\r\\ndirection of the work of ship-building. He agreed to take up the work at\\r\\nthe sacrifice of his personal wishes in the matter. His services were\\r\\nvirtually commandeered. His great experience as a steel maker and\\r\\nbuilder of ships has been drafted for the nation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the fact that production during the month of March had not been\\r\\nas great as had been hoped probably brought about this change, it should\\r\\nalso be said that those who had been responsible deserved much credit\\r\\nfor what had actually been done. They had been handicapped constantly by\\r\\npoor transportation and shortage of materials, but had worked faithfully\\r\\nand with what under ordinary circumstances would be regarded as\\r\\nremarkable success. The call upon Mr. Schwab was simply an effort to\\r\\ndraft into the service of the country its very highest executive\\r\\nability. Mr. Schwab\\'s name had been mentioned before for more than one\\r\\ngovernment post, and it was thought that here was the place where his\\r\\ntalents could have the fullest play. It was stated in Washington that he\\r\\nwould receive a salary of one dollar a year.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Schwab at once proceeded to \"speed up\" the shipping-program. It took\\r\\nhim just one day to arrange his own business affairs and then he began\\r\\nhis work. His first day was spent in going over the details of his task\\r\\nwith Chairman Hurley and Mr. Piez. He then received newspaper men,\\r\\nbeginning the campaign of publicity which turned out to be so\\r\\nsuccessful. He was full of compliments for the work which had already\\r\\nbeen done. \"It is prodigious, splendid, magnificent!\" he said. \"It is\\r\\nfar greater than any man who hasn\\'t seen the inside of things can\\r\\nappreciate. The foundation is laid. That task is well done. We are going\\r\\nto get the results which are needed and I should be proud if I could\\r\\nhave any part in the accomplishment. All I can say for myself is that I\\r\\nam filled with enthusiasm, energy and confidence. Mr. Hurley and I are\\r\\nin full accord on everything, and we are going to work shoulder to\\r\\nshoulder to make the work a success, but the large burden must fall upon\\r\\nthe people at the yards, and they are entitled to any credit for\\r\\nsuccess. I do not want to have any man in the shipyards working for me.\\r\\nI want them all working with me. Nothing is going to be worth while\\r\\nunless we win this war, and everyone must do the task to which he is\\r\\ncalled.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the first steps that Mr. Schwab took to speed up ship production\\r\\nwas to establish his headquarters in Philadelphia, as the center of the\\r\\nship-building region. Chairman Hurley remained at Washington, and the\\r\\noperating department, which included agencies such as the Inter-Allied\\r\\nShip Control Committee, was removed to New York City. It was stated that\\r\\nnearly fifty per cent of the work in progress was within a short radius\\r\\nof Philadelphia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe year before the war the total output of the United States shipyards\\r\\nwas only two hundred and fifty thousand tons. The program of the\\r\\nshipping board contemplated the construction of one thousand one hundred\\r\\nand forty-five steel ships, with a tonnage of eight million one hundred\\r\\nand sixty-four thousand five hundred and eight, and four hundred and\\r\\nninety wooden ships, with a tonnage of one million seven hundred and\\r\\nfifteen thousand. These of course could not be built in the shipyards\\r\\nthen in existence. New shipyards had to be built in various parts of the\\r\\ncountry.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first year after the shipping board took control, one hundred and\\r\\neighty-eight ships were put in the water and through requisition and by\\r\\nbuilding, one hundred and three more were added to the American merchant\\r\\nfleet. By April, 1918, the government had at its service 2,762,605 tons\\r\\nof shipping. During the month of May, the first month after Mr. Schwab\\r\\nbegan his work, the record of production had mounted from 160,286 tons\\r\\nto 263,571. American shipyards had completed and delivered during that\\r\\nmonth forty-three steel ships and one wooden ship. Mr. Hurley, in an\\r\\naddress on June 10th, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 1st, we had increased the American built tonnage to over\\r\\n3,500,000 dead-weight tons of shipping. This gives us a total of more\\r\\nthan one thousand four hundred ships with an approximate total\\r\\ndeadweight tonnage of 7,000,000 now under the control of the United\\r\\nStates Shipping Board. In round numbers and from all sources we have\\r\\nadded to the American flag since our war against Germany began, nearly\\r\\n4,500,000 tons of shipping. Our program calls for the building of 1,856\\r\\npassenger, cargo and refrigerator ships and tankers, ranging from five\\r\\nthousand to twelve thousand tons each, with an aggregate dead-weight of\\r\\nthirteen million. Exclusive of these we have two hundred and forty-five\\r\\ncommandeered vessels, taken over from foreign and domestic owners which\\r\\nare being completed by the Emergency Fleet Corporation. These will\\r\\naggregate a total dead-weight tonnage of 1,715,000. This makes a total\\r\\nof two thousand one hundred and one vessels, exclusive of tugs and\\r\\nbarges which are being built and will be put on the seas in the course\\r\\nof carrying out the present program, with an aggregate dead-weight\\r\\ntonnage of 14,715,000. Five billion dollars will be required to finish\\r\\nour program, but the expenditure of this enormous sum will give to the\\r\\nAmerican people the greatest merchant fleet ever assembled in the\\r\\nhistory of the world. American workmen have made the expansion of recent\\r\\nmonths possible, and they will make possible the successful conclusion\\r\\nof the whole program.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the wonderful work that followed his appointment Mr. Schwab\\r\\nconstantly came before the public, mainly through his addresses to the\\r\\nworking men of the different yards. His main endeavor was to stimulate\\r\\nenthusiasm and rivalry among the men. A ten-thousand-dollar prize was\\r\\noffered to the yard producing the largest surplus above its program, and\\r\\nhe traveled throughout the country urging the employees at all the great\\r\\nyards to break their records. The result of his work was that it was not\\r\\nlong before it was announced that the monthly tonnage of ships completed\\r\\nby the Allies exceeded the tonnage of those sunk by the German\\r\\nsubmarine. The menace of the submarine, which had seemed so formidable,\\r\\nhad disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most important of the great shipyards which were producing the\\r\\nAmerican cargo ships was at Hog Island in the southwest part of\\r\\nPhiladelphia. This shipyard may indeed be called the greatest shipyard\\r\\nin the world. Before Mr. Schwab became Director General much criticism\\r\\nhad been launched at the work that was going on there, and an\\r\\ninvestigation had been made which resulted in a favorable report. On\\r\\nAugust 5th the new shipyard launched its first ship, the 7,500 ton\\r\\nfreight steamer, Quistconck, in the presence of a distinguished throng\\r\\namong whom were the President of the United States and Mrs. Woodrow\\r\\nWilson. The ship was christened by Mrs. Wilson, and the President swung\\r\\nhis hat and led the cheers as the great ship glided down the ways. The\\r\\nname \"Quistconck\" is the ancient Indian name of Hog Island. The crowd\\r\\nnumbered more than sixty thousand people, and special trains from\\r\\nWashington and New York brought many notable guests. President and Mrs.\\r\\nWilson were escorted by Mr. Hurley and Mr. Schwab, and apparently\\r\\nthoroughly enjoyed the occasion. An enormous bouquet was presented to\\r\\nMrs. Wilson by Foreman McMillan, who had driven the first rivet in the\\r\\nQuistconck\\'s keel.\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly after the armistice it was announced that the Hog Island plant\\r\\nwould be acquired by the United States Government. The real estate,\\r\\nvalued at $1,760,000, was owned by the American International Ship\\r\\nBuilding Company, and the government had invested about $60,000,000 in\\r\\nequipping the plant. At the time the war ended thirty-five thousand\\r\\npersons were at work and a hundred and eighty ships were in various\\r\\nstages of completion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn interesting feature in connection with the endeavor to \"speed up\" was\\r\\nthe competition in riveting. Early in the year in yard after yard expert\\r\\nriveters were reported as making extraordinary records, and prizes were\\r\\noffered to the winners of such records. Later, however, such contests\\r\\nwere discouraged by Chairman Hurley and by others. The best record was\\r\\nmade by John Omir, who drove twelve thousand two hundred and nine rivets\\r\\nin nine hours at the Belfast Yards of Workman and Clark. In the\\r\\naccomplishment of this feat on two occasions he passed the mark of one\\r\\nthousand four hundred rivets an hour. In his best minute he drove\\r\\ntwenty-six rivets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ships constructed by the Shipping Board were of steel, of wood and\\r\\nof concrete, and at times considerable difference of opinion existed\\r\\nwith regard to which form of ship should receive the most attention. The\\r\\npolicy of the government seemed finally to favor the steel as it was\\r\\nclaimed that the wooden type was not only more expensive, but that it\\r\\nwas less efficient. However until the very end wooden ships in great\\r\\nnumbers were being built.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 31st the steamship Agawam, described as the first fabricated ship\\r\\nin the world, was launched in the yards of the Submarine Boat\\r\\nCorporation at Newark. This was essentially a standardized steel cargo\\r\\nship. \"Fabricated\" is the technical term applied to ships built from\\r\\nnumbered shapes made from patterns.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Carse, of the Submarine Boat Corporation, said that the Agawam\\r\\nwas the first of a hundred and fifty vessels of that type which would be\\r\\nconstructed in the yard. The parts were made, he said, in bridge and\\r\\ntank shops throughout the country and were assembled at the yard.\\r\\n\"Ninety-five per cent of the work in forming the parts entering into the\\r\\nhull of this vessel, and punching rivet holes, is done at shops widely\\r\\nseparated, from drawings furnished by this company, and these drawings\\r\\nhave been of such exactitude, and the work has been so carefully\\r\\nperformed by the different bridge shops that when they are brought\\r\\ntogether at this yard they fit perfectly and the ship as you see is\\r\\nabsolutely fair. The construction of the hull of this vessel requires\\r\\nthe driving of over four hundred thousand rivets, and by our method more\\r\\nthen one quarter of these rivets are driven at the distant shops, the\\r\\ndifferent parts being brought to the yard in sections as large as can be\\r\\ntransported on the railroad. Each part is numbered and lettered and as\\r\\nthey are shaped perfectly all that is necessary is to place them in\\r\\nposition, bolt them, and finally fasten them with rivets.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficials of the company said that they expected to launch in the course\\r\\nof time two such vessels in each week. A standard ship of this type has\\r\\na dead-weight carrying capacity of five thousand five hundred tons. It\\r\\nis three hundred and forty-three feet long and forty-six feet wide and\\r\\nis expected to show an average speed of ten and a half knots. Fuel oil\\r\\nis used to generate steam, to drive a turbine operating three thousand,\\r\\nsix hundred revolutions a minute. The oil is carried in compartments of\\r\\nthe double bottom of the ship in sufficient quantity for more than a\\r\\nround trip to Europe. Twenty-seven steel mills, fifty-six fabricating\\r\\nplants, and two hundred foundries and equipment shops were drawn upon to\\r\\nconstruct the ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the steel and wood vessels the Emergency Fleet\\r\\nCorporation also constructed a number of concrete ships. The first step\\r\\nin this direction was taken on April 3d, when the construction of four\\r\\n7,500-ton concrete ships at a Pacific coast shipyard was authorized.\\r\\nThis action was taken as a result of a report on the trials made with\\r\\nthe concrete ship, Faith, which was built in San Francisco by private\\r\\ncapital. The test of this ship had been satisfactory and Mr. R. J. Wig,\\r\\nan agent of the Emergency Fleet Corporation, who had made a careful\\r\\ninspection of the Faith and watched the tests, reported his confidence\\r\\nin the new cargo carrier. The successful trial trip of the Faith led, on\\r\\nthe 17th of May, to the government order that fifty-eight mere such\\r\\nships be constructed. Sites for yards were leased and contracts awarded.\\r\\nThe concrete ship turned out to be a great success.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe extraordinary success of the American ship-building program during\\r\\nthe World War was due to the enthusiasm of the workmen employed at the\\r\\ngovernment plants, and that same enthusiasm was found in connection with\\r\\ntheir work in every industry on which the Government made demands.\\r\\nAmerican labor was thoroughly loyal. It recognized that in the war for\\r\\ndemocracy against autocracy it had a vital concern. The attitude of the\\r\\ngreat American labor unions must however be sharply distinguished from\\r\\nthat of the extreme socialists who refused to take any part in helping\\r\\nto win the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the very beginning, the American Federation of Labor took a\\r\\npatriotic stand. Its leader was Mr. Samuel Gompers, and it was fortunate\\r\\nfor America that the leadership of this great organization was in such\\r\\npatriotic hands. Mr. Gompers had been for many years president of this\\r\\ngreat labor organization, and was so often called in consultation by the\\r\\nPresident of the United States in connection with labor affairs that he\\r\\nmight almost be called an unofficial member of the President\\'s cabinet.\\r\\nMr. Gompers was by birth an Englishman, but he had left his home when\\r\\nstill a boy and was thoroughly filled with true American patriotism.\\r\\nFrom the beginning he devoted himself with the greatest enthusiasm not\\r\\nonly to the protection of the interests of which he was in charge, but\\r\\nto the prosecution of a successful war. He had to contend, as labor\\r\\nleaders in other countries had been compelled to contend, with\\r\\nsocialistic and anarchistic organizations.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the period of America\\'s participation in the war there were\\r\\ncertain disturbances caused by the I. W. W., but from such movements the\\r\\nAmerican Federation of Labor held itself aloof. Occasional strikes, on\\r\\naccount of special conditions, were easily settled. The governmental\\r\\nassumption of control over railroads and other essential industries had\\r\\nmuch to do with the peaceful attitude of the workmen. The very high\\r\\nwages which were offered to the workmen at munitions works,\\r\\nship-building plants and other governmental enterprises enabled the\\r\\nworkmen there to live in reasonable comfort, though it caused a great\\r\\ndeal of trouble in private industry, and compelled an increase in pay to\\r\\nlabor all over the land.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the latter part of the war Mr. Gompers traveled abroad, as a\\r\\nrepresentative of American labor, and was greeted everywhere with the\\r\\nutmost enthusiasm, while his influence was strongly felt in favor of\\r\\nmoderate and sane views as to labor\\'s rights.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American situation with regard to labor was made much simpler by the\\r\\norganization of the United States Employment Service. This was made an\\r\\narm of the Department of Labor, with branch offices in nearly all the\\r\\nlarge cities of every state. It had a large corps of traveling\\r\\nexaminers, men skilled in determining the fitness of workers for\\r\\nparticular jobs, and it undertook to recruit labor for the various war\\r\\nindustries in which they were needed. During the last year of the war\\r\\nfrom a hundred and fifty thousand to two hundred thousand workers of all\\r\\nkinds were given work each month. In addition to this the Employment\\r\\nService was a clearing house of information for manufacturers. The\\r\\nDirector General of this service was Mr. John B. Densmore.\\r\\n\\r\\nLabor throughout the country, except when influenced by men of foreign\\r\\nbirth who were not in touch with the spirit of America, was universally\\r\\nloyal, and its share in the winning of the war will always remain a\\r\\nmatter for pride.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph]\\r\\n  THE GREATEST SHIPYARD IN THE WORLD\\r\\n  View of Hog Island shipyard near Philadelphia, showing the forest of\\r\\n  derricks rising from its fifty shipways. At the time the war ended,\\r\\n  35,000 persons were at work and 180 ships were in course of\\r\\n  completion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Painting]\\r\\n  THE LARGEST SHIP IN THE WORLD AS A U. S. TRANSPORT\\r\\n  Among the German ships taken over by the United States at the outbreak\\r\\n  of the war was the \"Vaterland,\" the largest ship ever built. She was\\r\\n  renamed the \"Leviathan\" and used as a transport, carrying 12,000\\r\\n  American soldiers past the submarines on each trip. She is shown here\\r\\n  entering a French harbor at the end of a passage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLI\\r\\n\\r\\nGERMANY\\'S DYING DESPERATE EFFORT\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the spring of 1918 it must have been plain to the German High Command\\r\\nthat if the war was to be won it must be won at once. In spite of all\\r\\ntheir leaders said of the impossibility of bringing an American army to\\r\\nFrance they must have been well informed of what the Americans were\\r\\ndoing. They knew that there were already more than two million men in\\r\\nactive training in the American army, and while at that time only a\\r\\nsmall proportion of them were available on the battle front, yet every\\r\\nday that proportion was growing greater and by the middle of the summer\\r\\nthe little American army would have become a tremendous fighting force.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir own armies on their western front had been enormously increased in\\r\\nsize by the removal to that front of troops from Russia. Hundreds of\\r\\nthousands of their best regiments were now withdrawn from the east and\\r\\nincorporated under the command of their great Generals, Hindenburg and\\r\\nLudendorf, in the armies of the west. They must, therefore, take\\r\\nadvantage of this increased force and win the war before the Americans\\r\\ncould come.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem of the Allies was also simple. It was not necessary for them\\r\\nto plan a great offensive. All they had to do was to hold out until,\\r\\nthrough the American aid which was coming now in such numbers, their\\r\\narmies would be so increased that German resistance would be futile.\\r\\nUnder such circumstances began the last great offensive of the German\\r\\narmy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that time it seems probable that the armies of Great Britain and\\r\\nFrance numbered about three million five hundred thousand men, and that,\\r\\nof these, six hundred and seventy thousand were on the front lines when\\r\\nthe German attack began, leaving an army of reserve of about two million\\r\\neight hundred and fifty thousand men. A considerable number of these\\r\\nwere probably in England on leave. The number of French soldiers must\\r\\nhave been between four and five million, of whom about one million five\\r\\nhundred thousand were on the front line. Adding to these the American,\\r\\nBelgian, Portuguese, Russian and Polish troops the Allied forces could\\r\\nnot have been short of eight million five hundred thousand men.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map: Lens on the North, St. Quentin on the East, Soissons\\r\\non the South, Amiens on the West.]\\r\\n  HOW GERMANY ATTEMPTED TO DIVIDE THE ALLIED ARMIES\\r\\n  The map shows the ground covered by the Germans in the terrific\\r\\n  Picardy drive of March, 1918, which had for its object the capture of\\r\\n  Amiens and the push forward along the Somme to the channel, thus\\r\\n  dividing the British army in the north from the French and Americans\\r\\n  in the south.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe strength of the Germans on the western front before the Russian\\r\\nRevolution was probably about four million five hundred thousand men,\\r\\nand the withdrawal of Russia from the war had added to that number\\r\\nprobably as many as one million five hundred thousand men, making an\\r\\narmy of six million men to oppose that of the Allies. The Allies,\\r\\ntherefore, must have considerably outnumbered the Germans.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of this fact in nearly all the engagements in the early part of\\r\\nthe great offensive the Allied forces were outnumbered in a ratio\\r\\nvarying from three to one to five to three. This was possible, first,\\r\\nbecause in any offensive the attacking side naturally concentrates as\\r\\nmany troops as it can gather at the point from which the offense is to\\r\\nbegin, and second, since the Allies were not under one command it was\\r\\nwith great difficulty that arrangements could be made by which the\\r\\nforces of one nation could reinforce the armies of another.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first difficulty of course could not be obviated, but the solution\\r\\nof the second difficulty was the appointment of General Foch as\\r\\nCommander-in-Chief of all the Allied forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe appointment was made on March 28th and all the influence of the\\r\\nUnited States had been exerted in its favor. General Pershing at once\\r\\noffered to General Foch the unrestricted use of the American force in\\r\\nFrance and it was agreed that a large part of the American army should\\r\\nbe brigaded with the Allied troops wherever there were weak spots.\\r\\n\\r\\nFoch was already famous as the greatest strategist in Europe. He comes\\r\\nof a Basque family and was born in the town of Tarbes, in the Department\\r\\nof the Hautes-Pyrenees, which is on the border of Spain, on October 2,\\r\\n1851. Foch served as a subaltern in the Franco-Prussian War and at\\r\\ntwenty-six was made captain in the artillery. Later he became Professor\\r\\nof Tactics in the Ecole de Guerre, where he remained for five years. He\\r\\nthen returned to regimental work and won steady promotion until he\\r\\nbecame brigadier-general. He was sent back to the War College as\\r\\nDirector and wrote two books, \"The Principles of War\" and \"Conduct of\\r\\nWar,\" which have been translated into English, German and Italian and\\r\\nare considered standard works. He was now recognized as a man of unusual\\r\\nability and was appointed to the command first, of the Thirteenth\\r\\ndivision, then of the Eighth corps at Bourges, and then to the command\\r\\nof the Twentieth corps at Nancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike Marshal Joffre who was cool, careful, slow moving, Marshal Foch\\r\\nis full of daring and impetuosity. Everything is calculated\\r\\nscientifically but his strategy is full of dash. Many of his sayings\\r\\nhave been passed from mouth to mouth among the Allies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Find out the weak point of your enemy and deliver your blow there,\" he\\r\\nsaid once at a staff banquet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But suppose, General,\" said an officer, \"that the enemy has no weak\\r\\npoint?\" \"If the enemy has no weak point,\" replied the Commander, \"make\\r\\none.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was he who telegraphed to Joffre during the first battle of the\\r\\nMarne: \"The enemy is attacking my flank. My rear is threatened. I am\\r\\ntherefore attacking in front.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFoch is a great student, an especial admirer of Napoleon, whose\\r\\ncampaigns he had thoroughly studied. Even the campaigns of Caesar he had\\r\\nfound valuable and had gathered from them practical suggestions for his\\r\\nown campaigns. He is the hero of the Marne, the man who on September 9th\\r\\nmarched his army between Von Bulow and Von Hausen\\'s Saxons, drove the\\r\\nPrussian Guards into the marshes of St. Gond and forced both Prussians\\r\\nand Saxons into their first great retreat. Later his armies fought on\\r\\nthe Yser while the British were battling at Ypres. During the battle of\\r\\nthe Somme he was on the English right pressing to Peronne.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a time he became Chief of the French Staff, until he was called into\\r\\nthe field again to his great command. Foch was one of those French\\r\\nofficers who had felt that war was sure to come, and had constantly\\r\\nurged that France should be kept in a state of preparedness. The\\r\\nappointment of General Foch to the Supreme Command was largely the\\r\\nresult of American urgency.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral March, the American Chief of Staff, in one of his weekly\\r\\nannouncements, stated: \"One of the most striking things noticeable in\\r\\nthe situation as it is shown on the western front is the supreme\\r\\nimportance of having a single command. The acceptance of the principle\\r\\nof having a single command, which was advocated by the President of the\\r\\nUnited States and carried through under his constant pressure, is one of\\r\\nthe most important single military things that has been done as far as\\r\\nthe Allies are concerned. The unity of command which Germany has had\\r\\nfrom the start of the war has been a very important military asset, and\\r\\nwe already see the supreme value of having that central command which\\r\\nnow has been concentrated in General Foch.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral March, who had earlier been appointed Chief of Staff of the\\r\\nUnited States army, was sending a steady stream of American troops to\\r\\nEurope, a fact whose importance was well understood by the new\\r\\nCommander-in-Chief. On General March\\'s promotion General Foch sent him\\r\\nthe following message:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI hear with deep satisfaction of your promotion to the rank of General.\\r\\nI associate myself to the just pride which you must feel in evoking the\\r\\nnames of your glorious predecessors, Grant and Sheridan. I convey to you\\r\\nmy sincere congratulations and I am happy to see you assume permanently\\r\\nthe huge task of Chief of Staff of the United States army which you are\\r\\nalready performing in so brilliant a way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral March replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYour message of congratulation upon my promotion to the grade of General\\r\\nChief of Staff, United States army, was personally conveyed to me by\\r\\nGeneral Vignal, French Military Attache. I appreciate deeply your most\\r\\nkindly greetings and in expressing my most sincere thanks, avail myself\\r\\nof the opportunity to assure you of every assistance and constant\\r\\nsupport which may lie in my power to aid you in the furtherance and\\r\\nsuccessful accomplishment of your great task.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Foch took command at a very critical time. The Germans had\\r\\nprepared the most formidable drive in the history of the war. They had\\r\\ngathered immense masses of munitions and supplies. Their great armies\\r\\nhad been refitted and they were in hopes of a victory which would end\\r\\nthe war. Their great offensive had many phases. It resulted in the\\r\\ndevelopment of three great salients, the first in Picardy and in the\\r\\ndirection of Amiens along the Somme, which was launched on March 21st;\\r\\nthe second on the Lys, which was launched on April 9th; and the third\\r\\nwhich is called the Oise-Marne salient, launched on May 27th.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween the attacks which developed these salients there were also some\\r\\nunsuccessful attacks of almost equal power. On March 28th there was a\\r\\ndesperate struggle to capture Arras, preceded by a bombardment as great\\r\\nas any during the whole offensive, but this attack was defeated with\\r\\nenormous losses to the German troops. A fourth phase of the German\\r\\noffensive took place on June 9th, on a front of twenty miles between\\r\\nNoyon and Montdidier, which gained a few miles at an enormous cost.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map: Belgium and Eastern France, show the front from\\r\\nYpres south to Rheims.]\\r\\n  THE LAST DESPERATE DRIVES OF THE GERMANS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 15th came the last of the great offensives. It was a smash on a\\r\\nsixty-mile line from Chateau-Thierry up the Marne, around Rheims, and\\r\\nthen east to a few miles west of the Argonne forest. This offensive at\\r\\nthe start made a penetration of from three to five miles, but was held\\r\\nfirmly and much of the gain lost, through the counter-attacks of the\\r\\nAllies. It was at this point that the American troops first began to be\\r\\nseriously felt, and it was at this point that General Foch took up the\\r\\nstory, and began the great series of Allied drives which were to crush\\r\\nthe German power. But there had been many days of great anxiety before\\r\\nthe turn of the tide.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe objects of the German drives were doubtless more or less dependent\\r\\nupon their success. The first drive in Picardy, in the direction of\\r\\nAmiens had apparently as its object to drive a wedge between the French\\r\\nand British and the object was so nearly attained that only the heroic\\r\\nwork of General Carey saved the Allies from disaster.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fifth British army, which had borne the brunt of the German attack,\\r\\nhad found itself almost crushed by the sheer weight of numbers. The\\r\\nwhole line was broken up and it seemed as if the road was open to\\r\\nAmiens. French reinforcements could not come up in time; bridges could\\r\\nnot be blown up because the engineers were all killed. Orders came to\\r\\nGeneral Carey at two o\\'clock in the morning, March 26th, to hold the\\r\\ngap. He at once proceeded to gather an extemporized army.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery available man was rounded up, among others a body of American\\r\\nengineers. Laborers, sappers, raw recruits as well as soldiers of every\\r\\narm. There were plenty of machine guns, but few men knew how to handle\\r\\nthem. With this scratch army in temporary trenches, he lay for six days,\\r\\nand as Lloyd George said, \"They held the German army and closed that gap\\r\\non the way to Amiens.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this fight General Carey rode along the lines shouting\\r\\nencouraging words to his hard-pressed men. He did not know whether he\\r\\nwould get supplies of ammunition and provisions or not, but he stuck to\\r\\nit. Later on the regular troops arrived. The American engineers, who had\\r\\nbeen fighting, immediately returned to their base, and resumed work\\r\\nlaying out trenches. General Rawlinson, Commander of the British army at\\r\\nthat point, sent the commanding officer of the Americans engaged, the\\r\\nfollowing letter:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe army Commander wishes to record officially his appreciation of the\\r\\nexcellent work your regiment has done in assisting the British army to\\r\\nresist the enemy\\'s powerful offensive during the last ten days. I fully\\r\\nrealize that it has been largely due to your assistance that the enemy\\r\\nhas been checked, and I rely on you to assist us still further during\\r\\nthe few days that are still to come before I shall be able to relieve\\r\\nyou in the line. I consider your work in the line to be greatly enhanced\\r\\nby the fact that for six weeks previous to your taking your place in the\\r\\nfront line your men had been working at such high pressure erecting\\r\\nheavy bridges on the Somme. My best congratulations and warm thanks to\\r\\nall.\\r\\nRAWLINSON.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe demoralization of General Gough\\'s Fifth army, which had thus left an\\r\\neight-mile gap on the left, and which had been saved at that point by\\r\\nGeneral Carey, permitted also the opening of another gap between its\\r\\nright wing and the Sixth French army. Here General Fayolle did with\\r\\norganized troops what Carey had done with his volunteers further north.\\r\\nThe reason for the success of both Carey and Fayolle appears to have\\r\\nbeen that the German armies had been so thoroughly battered that they\\r\\nwere unable to take advantage of the situation. Their regiments had been\\r\\nmixed up, their officers had been separated from their men in the rush\\r\\nof the attack, and before they could recover the opportunity was lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first days of April saw the end of the drive toward Amiens. The\\r\\nGermans claimed the capture of ninety thousand prisoners and one\\r\\nthousand three hundred guns. They had penetrated into the Allies\\'\\r\\nterritory in some points a distance of thirty-five miles. Their new line\\r\\nextended southwest from Arras beyond Albert to the west of Moreuil,\\r\\nwhich is about nine miles south of Amiens, and then went on west of\\r\\nPierrepont and Montdidier, curving out at Noyon to the region of the\\r\\nOise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first part of April was a comparative calm, when suddenly there\\r\\ndeveloped the second drive of the German offensive. This drive was not\\r\\nso extensive as the first one, and its object appeared to be to break\\r\\nthrough the British forces in Flanders and reach the Channel ports. It\\r\\nresulted in a salient embracing an area about three hundred and twenty\\r\\nsquare miles, and the Germans claimed the capture of twenty thousand\\r\\nprisoners and two hundred guns. It was at this point that General Haig\\r\\nissued his famous order in which he described the British armies as\\r\\nstanding with their \"backs to the wall.\" It reads as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThree weeks ago today the enemy began his terrific attacks against us on\\r\\na fifty-mile front. Its objects are to separate us from the French, to\\r\\ntake the Channel ports, and to destroy the British army. In spite of\\r\\nthrowing already one hundred and six divisions into the battle and\\r\\nenduring the most reckless sacrifice of human life, he has yet made\\r\\nlittle progress toward his goals. We owe this to the determined fighting\\r\\nand self-sacrifice of our troops. Words fail me to express the\\r\\nadmiration which I feel for the splendid resistance offered by all ranks\\r\\nof our army under the most trying circumstances. Many among us now are\\r\\ntired. To those I would say that victory will belong to the side which\\r\\nholds out the longest. The French army is moving rapidly and in great\\r\\nforce to our support. There is no other course open to us but to fight\\r\\nit out. Every position must be held to the last man. There must be no\\r\\nretiring. With our backs to the wall and believing in the justice of our\\r\\ncause each one of us must fight to the end. The safety of our homes, and\\r\\nthe freedom of mankind depend alike upon the conduct of each one of us\\r\\nat this critical moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British commander\\'s order made the situation clear to the British\\r\\npeople and to the world. The Germans had given up for the moment their\\r\\nattempt to divide the British and French armies, and were now attempting\\r\\nto seize the Channel ports, and the British were fighting with true\\r\\nBritish pluck with their \"backs to the wall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne can imagine the anxiety in the villages of Flanders where they\\r\\nwatched the German advance and heard the terrible bombardment which was\\r\\ndestroying their beautiful little cities, and threatening to put them\\r\\nunder the dominion of the brutal conquerors of Belgium. Town after town\\r\\nfell to the enemy until at last the German attack began to weaken.\\r\\n\\r\\nCounter-attacks on April 17th recaptured the villages of Wytschaete and\\r\\nMeteren. At other points German attacks were repulsed, and the attack on\\r\\nthe Lys had reached its limits. It had not only failed to reach the\\r\\ncoast but it had not even reached so far as to force the evacuation of\\r\\nYpres or to endanger Arras. On the contrary the Germans had paid for\\r\\ntheir advance by such terrible losses that the ground that they had\\r\\ngained meant almost nothing. They then made, on April 30th, a vigorous\\r\\nendeavor to broaden the Amiens salient in the region of Hangard and\\r\\nNoyon. This attack also failed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 27th Ludendorf made his next move. This was in the south, and was\\r\\npreceded by the most elaborate preparations over a forty-mile front. At\\r\\nfirst it met with great success. German troops from a point northwest of\\r\\nRheims to Montdidier were moving apparently with the purpose of breaking\\r\\nthe French lines and clearing the way for a drive to Paris.\\r\\nConsternation reigned among Allied observers as the Germans carried,\\r\\napparently with ease, first the formidable Chemin des Dames, which was\\r\\nbelieved invulnerable, and then the south bank of the Aisne, with its\\r\\ngreat fortifications at Soissons.\\r\\n\\r\\nCriticism began to appear of General Foch, who was thought at first to\\r\\nhave been taken by surprise. The Germans were using four hundred\\r\\nthousand of their best troops, and the greatest force of tanks, machine\\r\\nguns and poison-gas projectors which they had ever gathered. They\\r\\ncaptured over forty-five thousand prisoners and took four hundred guns.\\r\\nThey penetrated thirty miles and gained six hundred and fifty square\\r\\nmiles of territory, but they were held on the River Marne.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is now apparent that General Foch knew exactly what he was about. He\\r\\nmight easily, by sending in reinforcements, have put up the same\\r\\ndesperate resistance to the German offensive which they were now meeting\\r\\nin other sectors. But he preferred to retreat and lead the enemy on to a\\r\\nposition which would make them vulnerable to the great counter-attack he\\r\\nwas preparing for them on their flank. The Germans reached the Marne,\\r\\nbut they paid for it in the terrible losses which they incurred.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German line now from Montdidier, the extreme point of the Amiens\\r\\nsalient, to Chateau-Thierry, the point of the new Marne salient, was in\\r\\nthe form of a bow, and on June 9th General Ludendorf attempted to\\r\\nstraighten out the line. His new attack was made on a twenty-mile front\\r\\nbetween Montdidier and Noyon in the direction of Compiegne. This was\\r\\nanother terrific drive and at first gained about seven miles. French\\r\\ncounter-attacks, however, not only held him in a vise but regained a\\r\\ndistance of about one mile. This battle was probably the most disastrous\\r\\none fought by the Germans during their whole offensive. Nearly four\\r\\nhundred thousand men were completely used up, without gaining the\\r\\nslightest strategic success.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen followed a period without battles of major importance, during which\\r\\nGeneral Foch by periodic assaults on the Lys, the Somme, on the flanks\\r\\nof Montdidier and Soissons, on the Chateau-Thierry sector and southwest\\r\\nof Rheims, captured many important positions and kept the enemy in\\r\\nconstant anxiety.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the great German offensives the Germans had lost at least five\\r\\nhundred thousand men, while the casualties of the Allies were barely one\\r\\nhundred and fifty thousand. The Germans also were beginning to lose\\r\\ntheir morale. They were finding that however great might be their\\r\\nefforts, however terrible might be their losses, they were still being\\r\\nconstantly held. Their troops were now apparently made of inferior\\r\\nmaterial, and included boys, old men and even convicts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe system of making attacks by means of shock troops was producing the\\r\\ninevitable result. The shock regiments were composed of selected men,\\r\\npicked here and there, from the regular troops. Their selection had\\r\\nnaturally weakened the regiments from which they were taken. After three\\r\\nmonths of great offensives these shock troops were now in great part\\r\\ndestroyed, and the German lines were being held mainly by the inferior\\r\\ntroops which had been left. Moreover, in other parts of the world, the\\r\\nallies of Germany were being beaten. In Italy and Albania and Macedonia\\r\\nthere was danger.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Germans prepared for one more effort. On June 18th they had made a\\r\\ncostly attempt to carry Rheims. On July 15th they made their last drive.\\r\\nLudendorf took almost a month for preparation. He gathered together\\r\\nseventy divisions and great masses of munitions, and then drove in from\\r\\nChateau-Thierry on a sixty-mile line up on the Marne, and then east to\\r\\nthe Argonne forests. His line made a sort of semicircle around Rheims\\r\\nand then pushed south to the east and west of that fortress.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce again he had temporary success. West of Rheims he penetrated a\\r\\ndistance of five miles, and on the first day, had crossed the Marne at\\r\\nDormans, but was held sharply by the Americans east of Chateau-Thierry.\\r\\nOn the second day he made further gains, but with appalling losses. On\\r\\nthe 17th he was still struggling on with minor successes but on July\\r\\n18th the French and Americans launched the great counter-offensive from\\r\\nChateau-Thierry along a twenty-five mile front, between the Marne and\\r\\nthe Aisne. The Germans everywhere began their retreat and the war tide\\r\\nhad turned.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German attack east of Rheims had been a failure from the start. The\\r\\nAllied forces retired about two miles and then held firm. The country\\r\\nthere is flat and sandy and gave little shelter to the attacking forces\\r\\nwhich lost terribly. In this sector, too, there were many American\\r\\ntroops, who behaved with distinguished bravery.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time nearly seven hundred thousand men of the American army were\\r\\non the battle line. They had been fighting here and there among the\\r\\nFrench and English but on June 22d General March made the announcement\\r\\nthat five divisions of these troops had been transferred to the direct\\r\\ncommand of General Pershing as a nucleus for an American army.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn glancing back at the great German drives which have now been\\r\\ndescribed, one is impressed by the terrific character of the fighting.\\r\\nThis struggle undoubtedly was the greatest exertion of military power in\\r\\nthe history of the world. Never before had such masses of munitions been\\r\\nused; never before had scientific knowledge been so drawn on in the\\r\\nservice of war. Thousands of airplanes were patrolling the air,\\r\\nsometimes scouting, sometimes dropping bombs on hostile troops or on\\r\\nhostile stores, sometimes flying low, firing their machine guns into the\\r\\nfaces of marching troops. Thousands upon thousands of great guns were\\r\\nsending enormous projectiles, which made great pits wherever they fell.\\r\\nSwarms of machine guns were pouring their bullets like water from a hose\\r\\nupon the charging soldiers.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most noticeable artillery developments was the long-range gun\\r\\nwhich off and on during this period was bombarding Paris. This\\r\\nbombardment began on March 23d, when the nearest German line was more\\r\\nthan sixty-two miles away. For a time the story was regarded as pure\\r\\nfiction, but it was soon established that the great nine-inch shells\\r\\nwhich were dropping into the city every twenty minutes came from the\\r\\nforests of St. Gobain, seven miles back of the French trenches near\\r\\nLaon, and about seventy-five miles from Paris. This was another of those\\r\\nfutile bits of frightfulness in which the Germans reveled. Military\\r\\nadvantage gained by such a gun was almost nothing, and the expense of\\r\\nevery shot was out of all proportion to the damage inflicted. It only\\r\\nroused intense indignation and stirred the Allies to greater\\r\\ndetermination. The first day\\'s casualties in Paris were ten killed and\\r\\nfifteen wounded. By the next day one would not have been able to tell\\r\\nfrom the Paris streets that such a bombardment was going on at all. The\\r\\nsubway and surface cars were running, the streets were thronged and\\r\\ntraffic was going on as usual. About two dozen shells were thrown into\\r\\nParis every day, mainly in the Montmartre district, in a radius of about\\r\\na mile. This seemed to show that the gun was immovable.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 29th, however, a shell struck the church of St. Gervais during\\r\\nthe Good Friday service, killing seventy-five persons and wounding\\r\\nninety. Fifty-four of those killed were women. The church had been\\r\\nstruck at the moment of the Elevation of the Host. This outrage aroused\\r\\nspecial indignation, and Pope Benedict sent a protest to Berlin.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn examination of exploded shells indicated that the new German gun was\\r\\nless than nine inches in caliber, and that the projectiles, which\\r\\nweighed about two hundred pounds, contained two charges, in two chambers\\r\\nconnected by a fuse which often exploded more than a minute apart. It\\r\\ntook three minutes for each shell to travel to Paris and it was\\r\\nestimated that such a shell rose to a height of twenty miles from the\\r\\nearth. Three of these guns were used. One of these guns exploded on\\r\\nMarch 29th, killing a German lieutenant and nine men. The Kaiser was\\r\\npresent when the gun was first used. It was said by American scientists\\r\\nthat seismographs in the United States felt the shock of each discharge.\\r\\nOn April 9th French aviators discovered the location of the new guns,\\r\\nand French artillery began to drop enormous shells weighing half a ton\\r\\neach near the German monsters. A few days later a French shell fell on\\r\\nthe barrel of one of these guns and put it out of commission. Great\\r\\ncraters were made around the other, interfering with its use, and toward\\r\\nthe end of the period it was only occasionally that the remaining gun\\r\\nwas fired, and no great damage resulted.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother feature of the great German drives was the tremendous\\r\\ndestruction that accompanied them. Not only were churches, public\\r\\nbuildings, and private houses throughout almost the whole district\\r\\nturned into ruins, but the very ground itself was plowed up into craters\\r\\nand shell holes, and the trees smashed into mere splinters. During the\\r\\nwhole campaign poison gas of various kinds was used in immense\\r\\nquantities, and it was constantly necessary for the troops to wear gas\\r\\nmasks. Sometimes after a town had been evacuated by the enemy it was so\\r\\nfilled with gas that it was impossible for victorious troops to enter.\\r\\nOne of the fiercest bombardments was that directed against the\\r\\nPortuguese during the fighting along the Lys. The enemy made a special\\r\\nattempt to crush the Portuguese contingent which behaved with the utmost\\r\\ngallantry.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the season of the year when the orchards were covered with\\r\\nblossoms and the fields with flowers, but the horrors of war destroyed\\r\\nthe beauty of the spring. In these battles men fought until they were\\r\\ncompletely exhausted and one could see troops staggering as they walked\\r\\nand leaning on each other from pure exhaustion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese were days when wonders were performed by the Medical Departments\\r\\nof the Allied armies, and the work of the Red Cross was almost as\\r\\nimportant as the work of the soldiers. Relief for the wounded had to be\\r\\nundertaken and carried on a mammoth scale. Many of the doctors, nurses,\\r\\norderlies and ambulance men lost their lives while making efforts to\\r\\nrescue the wounded.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese were days when the German leaders were filled with the pride of\\r\\nvictory. They were talking now about a hard German peace. On June 17th\\r\\nthe German Kaiser celebrated the thirtieth anniversary of his accession\\r\\nto the throne. He talked no more of a war of self-defense, but declared\\r\\nthe war to be the struggle of two world views wrestling with each other.\\r\\n\"Either German principles of right, freedom, honor and morality must be\\r\\nupheld, or Anglo-Saxon principles with their idolatry of Mammon must be\\r\\nvictorious.\" He sent congratulations to Field Marshal von Hindenburg, to\\r\\nGeneral Ludendorf and to the Crown Prince. Von Hindenburg assured the\\r\\nKaiser of the unswerving loyalty until death of Germany\\'s sons at the\\r\\nfront, and concluded \"May our old motto \\'Forward with God for King and\\r\\nFatherland, for Kaiser and Empire\\' result in many years of peace being\\r\\ngranted to your Majesty after our victorious return home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the terrific attacks which the German commanders directed upon the\\r\\nAmericans at Chateau-Thierry and at other points upon the southern lines\\r\\nshow well that they knew that there was another danger rising to\\r\\nconfront them; that during their great drives a million and a half\\r\\nAmerican soldiers had been learning the art of war, and that every\\r\\nmoment of delay meant a new danger. By the end of this period the\\r\\nAmericans had arrived.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLII\\r\\n\\r\\nCHATEAU-THIERRY, FIELD OF GLORY\\r\\n\\r\\nNowhere in American history may be found a more glorious record than\\r\\nthat which crowned with laurel the American arms at Chateau-Thierry.\\r\\nHere the American Marines and divisions comprising both volunteers and\\r\\nselected soldiers, were thrown before the German tide of invasion like a\\r\\nhuge khaki-colored breakwater. Germany knew that a test of its empire\\r\\nhad come. To break the wall of American might it threw into the van of\\r\\nthe attack the Prussian Guard backed by the most formidable troops of\\r\\nthe German and Austrian empires. The object was to put the fear of the\\r\\nHun into the hearts of the Yankees, to overwhelm them, to drive straight\\r\\nthrough them as the prow of a battleship shears through a heavy sea. If\\r\\nAmerica could be defeated, Germany\\'s way to a speedy victory was at\\r\\nhand. If America held--well, that way lay disaster.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Americans held. Not only did they hold but they counter-attacked\\r\\nwith such bloody consequences to the German army that Marshal Foch,\\r\\nseizing the psychological moment for his carefully prepared\\r\\ncounter-offensive, gave the word for a general attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Chateau-Thierry and the Marne as a hinge, the clamp of the Allies\\r\\nclosed upon the defeated Germans. From Switzerland to the North Sea the\\r\\ndrive went forward, operating as huge pincers cutting like chilled steel\\r\\nthrough the Hindenburg and the Kriemhild lines. It was the beginning of\\r\\nautocracy\\'s end, the end of Der Tag of which Germany had dreamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe matchless Marines and the other American troops suffered a loss that\\r\\nstaggered America. It was a loss, however, that was well worth while.\\r\\nThe heroic young Americans who held the might of Germany helpless and\\r\\nfinally rolled them back defeated from the field of battle, and who paid\\r\\nfor that victory with their lives, made certain the speedy end of the\\r\\nworld\\'s bloodiest war.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story of the American army\\'s effective operations in France from\\r\\nCantigny to the reduction of the St. Mihiel salient, is one long record\\r\\nof victories. To the glory of American arms must be recorded the fact\\r\\nthat at no time and at no place in the World War did the American forces\\r\\nretreat before the German hosts.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the latter days of May, 1918, the Allied forces in France seemed near\\r\\ndefeat. The Germans were steadily driving toward Paris. They had swept\\r\\nover the Chemin des Dames and the papers from day to day were\\r\\nchronicling wonderful successes. The Chemin des Dames had been regarded\\r\\nas impregnable, but the Germans passed it apparently without the\\r\\nslightest difficulty. They were advancing on a forty-mile front and on\\r\\nMay 28th had reached the Aisne, with the French and British steadily\\r\\nfalling back. The anxiety of the Allies throughout the world was\\r\\nindescribable. This was the great German \"Victory Drive\" and each day\\r\\nregistered a new Allied defeat. Newspaper headlines were almost\\r\\ndespairing.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 29th, however, in quiet type, under great headlines announcing a\\r\\nGerman gain of ten miles in which the Germans had taken twenty-five\\r\\nthousand prisoners and crossed two rivers, had captured Soissons, and\\r\\nwere threatening Rheims, there appeared in American papers a quiet\\r\\nlittle despatch from General Pershing. It read as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This morning in Picardy our troops attacked on a front of one and\\r\\none-fourth miles, advanced our lines, and captured the village of\\r\\nCantigny. We took two hundred prisoners, and inflicted on the enemy\\r\\nsevere losses in killed and wounded. Our casualties were relatively\\r\\nsmall. Hostile counter-attacks broke down under our fire.\" This was the\\r\\nfirst American offensive.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American troops had now been in Europe almost a year. At first but a\\r\\nsmall force, they had been greeted in Paris and in London with\\r\\ntremendous enthusiasm. Up to this point they had done little or nothing,\\r\\nbut the small force which passed through Paris in the summer of 1917 had\\r\\nbeen growing steadily. By this time the American army numbered more than\\r\\neight hundred thousand men. They had been getting ready; in camps far\\r\\nbehind the lines they had been trained, not only by their own officers,\\r\\nbut by some of the greatest experts in the French and the British\\r\\narmies. Thousands of officers and men who, but a few months before, had\\r\\nbeen busily engaged in civilian pursuits, had now learned something of\\r\\nthe art of war. They had been supplied with a splendid equipment, with\\r\\ngreat guns and with all the modern requirements of an up-to-date army.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph]\\r\\n  Copyright Committee on Public Information.\\r\\n  From Underwood and Underwood, N.

After that Germany never went forward\\r\\n  on any field of battle again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph]\\r\\n  French Official Photograph by International Film Service.\\r\\n  WIPING OUT THE ST. MIHIEL SALIENT\\r\\n  The first major exploit carried out independently by the American army\\r\\n  was the obliteration of the St. Mihiel salient, which had been in\\r\\n  German hands since 1914, a spectacular achievement, carried out in two\\r\\n  days with great brilliance and precision. The picture shows U. S.\\r\\n  troops following the Germans through Thiaucourt, one of the towns on\\r\\n  the salient.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some months, here and there, on the French and British lines small\\r\\ndetachments of American troops flanked on both sides by the Allied\\r\\nforces, had been learning the art of war. Here and there they had been\\r\\nunder fire. At Cantigny itself they had resisted attack. On May 27th\\r\\nGeneral Pershing had reported \"In Picardy, after violent artillery\\r\\npreparations, hostile infantry detachments succeeded in penetrating our\\r\\nadvance positions in two points. Our troops counter-attacked, completely\\r\\nexpelling the enemy and entering his lines.\" They had also been fighting\\r\\nthat day in the Woevre sector where a raiding party had been repulsed.\\r\\nThere had been other skirmishes, too, in which many Americans had won\\r\\nhonors both from Great Britain and France. But the attack at Cantigny\\r\\nwas the first distinct American advance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Americans penetrated the German positions to the depth of nearly a\\r\\nmile. Their artillery completely smothered the Germans, and its whirr\\r\\ncould be heard for many miles in the rear. Twelve French tanks supported\\r\\nthe American infantry. The artillery preparation lasted for one hour,\\r\\nand then the lines of Americans went over the top. A strong unit of\\r\\nflame throwers and engineers aided the Americans. The American barrage\\r\\nmoved forward a hundred yards in two minutes and then a hundred yards in\\r\\nfour minutes. The infantry followed with clock-like precision. Fierce\\r\\nhand-to-hand fighting occurred in Cantigny, which contained a large\\r\\ntunnel and a number of caves. The Americans hurled hand grenades like\\r\\nbaseballs into these shelters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attack had been carefully planned and was rehearsed by the infantry\\r\\nwith the tanks. In every detail it was under the direction of the\\r\\nSuperior French Command, to whom much of the credit for its success was\\r\\ndue. The news of the American success created general satisfaction among\\r\\nthe French and English troops. The operation, of course, was not one of\\r\\nthe very greatest importance. It was a sort of an experiment, but coming\\r\\nas it did, in the middle of the great German Drive, it was ominous.\\r\\nAmerica had arrived.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 30th General Pershing announced the complete repulse of further\\r\\nenemy attacks from the new American positions near Cantigny. This time\\r\\nhe says: \"there was considerable shelling with gas, but the results\\r\\nobtained were very small. The attempt was a complete failure. Our\\r\\ncasualties were very light. We have consolidated our positions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe London Evening News commenting on this fact says: \"Bravo the young\\r\\nAmericans! Nothing in today\\'s battle narrative from the front is more\\r\\nexhilarating than the account of their fight at Cantigny. It was clean\\r\\ncut from beginning to end, like one of their countrymen\\'s short stories,\\r\\nand the short story of Cantigny is going to expand into a full-length\\r\\nnovel which will write the doom of the Kaiser and Kaiserism. Cantigny\\r\\nwill one day be repeated a thousand fold.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Germans, in reporting this fight, avoided mention of the fact that\\r\\nthe operation had been conducted by American troops. This seemed to\\r\\nindicate that they feared the moral effect of such an admission in\\r\\nGermany. Up to this time, with the exception of small brigades, the\\r\\nAmerican army had been held as a reserve. After the Cantigny fight they\\r\\nwere hurried to the front. The main point to which they were sent at\\r\\nfirst was Chateau-Thierry, north of the Marne, the nearest point to\\r\\nParis reached by the enemy. There, at the very critical point of the\\r\\ngreat German Drive, they not only checked the enemy but, by a dashing\\r\\nattack, threw him back.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis may be said to be the turning point in the whole war. It not only\\r\\nstopped the German Drive at this point, but it gave new courage to the\\r\\nAllies and took the heart out of the Germans. The troops were rushed to\\r\\nthe battle front at Thierry, arriving on Saturday, June 1st. They\\r\\nentered the battle enthusiastically, almost immediately after they had\\r\\narrived. A despatch from Picardy says: \"On their way to the battle lines\\r\\nthey were cheered by the crowds in the villages through which they\\r\\npassed; their victorious stand with their gallant French Allies, so soon\\r\\nafter entering the line, has electrified all France.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Pershing\\'s terse account of what happened reads as follows: \"In\\r\\nthe fighting northwest of Chateau-Thierry our troops broke up an attempt\\r\\nof the enemy to advance to the south through Veuilly Woods, and by a\\r\\ncounter-attack drove him back to the north of the woods.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American troops had gone, into the action only an hour or so after\\r\\ntheir arrival on the banks of the River Marne. Scarcely had they\\r\\nalighted from their motor trucks when they were ordered into\\r\\nChateau-Thierry with a battalion of French-Colonial troops. The enemy\\r\\nwere launching a savage drive, and at first succeeded in driving the\\r\\nAmericans out of the woods of Veuilly-la-Poterie. But the Americans at\\r\\nonce counter-attacked, driving their opponents from their position, and\\r\\nregaining possession of the woods.  On the same day the Germans launched\\r\\nan attack of shock troops, attempting to gain a passage across the Marne\\r\\nat Jaulgonne. They obtained a footing on the southern bank but another\\r\\nAmerican counter-attack forced them back across the river. The American\\r\\nsoldiers were fighting with wonderful spirit, and the French papers were\\r\\nfilled with praise of their work. As they came up to go into the line\\r\\nthey were singing, and they charged, cheering.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map: Paris is in Southwest corner. Amiens in the\\r\\nNorthwest corner and Rheims is on the East side.]\\r\\n  WHERE THE \"YANKS\" FOUGHT THE SECOND BATTLE OF THE MARNE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 6th came a climax of the American fighting. It was the attack of\\r\\nthe American Marines in the direction of Torcy. This gained more than\\r\\ntwo miles over a two and a half mile front. On the next day the advance\\r\\ncontinued over a front of nearly six miles, and during the night the\\r\\nAmericans captured Bouresches and entered Torcy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fighting at Torcy was characteristically American; the Marines\\r\\nadvanced yelling like Indians, using bayonet and rifle. From Torcy the\\r\\nMarines set forward and took strong ground on either side of Belleau\\r\\nWood. They had reached all the objectives and pushed beyond them. The\\r\\nGermans were on the run, and surrendering right and left to the\\r\\nAmericans. The attack by the Marines forestalled an attack by the enemy.\\r\\nGerman reports now noticed the Americans. Their report on June 9th\\r\\nreferring to this attack, says: \"Americans who attempted to attack\\r\\nnorthwest of Chateau-Thierry were driven back beyond their positions of\\r\\ndeparture with heavy losses and prisoners were captured.\" The Americans\\r\\nhad lost heavily, and the hospitals were filled with their wounded, but\\r\\nthe thorough American organization was giving the wounded every care,\\r\\nand the Americans were still moving forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June the 10th, another attack was made on the German lines in the\\r\\nBelleau Wood, which penetrated for about two-thirds of a mile, leaving\\r\\nthe Germans in possession of only the northern fringe of the Wood. On\\r\\nJune 11th the official statement of the French War Office declared:\\r\\n\"South of the Ourcq River the American troops this morning brilliantly\\r\\ncaptured Belleau Wood, and took three hundred prisoners.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBelleau Wood had been considered an almost impregnable position, but the\\r\\nvaliant fighting of the American Marines had carried them past it.\\r\\nFighting here was not merely a series of exciting engagements, but an\\r\\nimportant action, which may have turned, and very probably did turn, the\\r\\nwhole tide of battle. The Americans put three German divisions out of\\r\\nbusiness, and caused a change in the German plans, by preventing an\\r\\nextending movement to Meaux, which was the German objective.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom this time on the confidence shown in all reports from the Allies in\\r\\nFrance was strengthened. They had found that the Americans were all that\\r\\nthey had hoped for, and they were sure now that they could hold on until\\r\\nthe full American strength could be brought to bear. General Pershing\\r\\nhimself was full of optimism and his fine example stimulated his troops.\\r\\nFrom this time on all dispatches show that the Americans were more and\\r\\nmore getting in the game. Repeated German attacks against their forces,\\r\\non the Belleau-Bouresches line were repulsed, in spite of the fact that\\r\\ncrack German divisions, who had been picked especially to punish them,\\r\\nhad been found on their front. It was later found that these divisions\\r\\nhad been suddenly ordered to that point \"in order to prevent at all\\r\\ncosts the Americans being able to achieve success.\" The German High\\r\\nCommand was apparently anxious to prevent American success from\\r\\nstimulating the morale of the Allied army.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the rest of the summer the Americans took an active part in\\r\\nFoch\\'s great offensive which ultimately crushed the German army. They\\r\\nwere heard from at widely divergent points: in Alsace, about\\r\\nChateau-Thierry, at Montdidier, and in the British lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the fighting during June indicated a slow advance at\\r\\nChateau-Thierry. On June 19th the Americans crossed the Marne, near that\\r\\ncity. But Chateau-Thierry itself was not captured until the middle of\\r\\nJuly. On June 29th they participated in a raid near Montdidier and on\\r\\nJuly 2d captured Vaux. In the week of July 4th news came of American\\r\\nsuccess in the Vosges. On July 18th they advanced close to Soissons. On\\r\\nAugust 3d the Americans captured Fismes, and then for nearly a month\\r\\nmade little actual progress, though bitter fighting went on in the\\r\\ncountry around Fismes and near Soissons. On August 29th after a furious\\r\\nbattle they captured the plain of Juvigny, north of Soissons.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn all these battles the Americans were doing their part at difficult\\r\\npoints, during the great French drive which was clearing out the Marne\\r\\nsalient.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 12th of September, the first American army, assisted by certain\\r\\nFrench units, and under the direct command of General Pershing, launched\\r\\nan attack against the St. Mihiel salient. This was the most important\\r\\noperation of the American troops in the Great War. It was a complete\\r\\nsuccess. September 12th was the fourth anniversary of the establishment\\r\\nof the salient, which reached out from the German line in the direction\\r\\nof Verdun.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attack was fighting on a grand scale, and that such an operation\\r\\nshould be intrusted to the American army indicated an entirely new phase\\r\\nof America\\'s participation in the war. It was preceded by a barrage\\r\\nlasting four hours. The German troops, though probably suspecting that\\r\\nsuch an attack was coming, were nevertheless surprised. The American\\r\\nattack was on the southern leg of the salient along a distance of twelve\\r\\nmiles. The French attacked on the western side from a front of eight\\r\\nmiles. Each attack was eminently successful. On the southern front the\\r\\nAmericans reached their first objectives at some points an hour ahead of\\r\\nschedule time. Thiaucourt was captured early in the drive; later the\\r\\nAmericans gained possession of Nonsard, Pannes, and Bouillonville.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map: Verdun in the Northwest corner, St. Mihiel in\\r\\nSouthwest, Metz in the Northeast]\\r\\n  THE GREAT ST. MIHIEL SALIENT ESTABLISHED IN 1914 WAS OBLITERATED BY\\r\\n  THE AMERICANS IN SEPTEMBER, 1918\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first the resistance of the Germans, without being tame, was not\\r\\nactually stiff, and the doughboys were able to sweep toward the second\\r\\nline of any position without difficulty. There, however, the Germans\\r\\nbegan to defend themselves sharply, which delayed, but did not stop the\\r\\nAmerican advance. The attack was made in two waves and carried the\\r\\nAmerican forces a distance of about five miles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day the attack continued, and General Pershing\\'s dispatch\\r\\nstated: \"In the St. Mihiel sector we have achieved further successes.\\r\\nThe junction of our troops advancing from the south of the sector with\\r\\nthose advancing from the west has given us possession of the whole\\r\\nsalient to points twelve miles northeast of St. Mihiel, and has resulted\\r\\nin the capture of many prisoners. Forced back by our steady advance the\\r\\nenemy is retiring, and is destroying large quantities of material as he\\r\\ngoes. The number of prisoners counted has risen to 13,300. Our line now\\r\\nincludes Herbeville, Thillet, Hattonville, St. Benoit, Xammes, Jaulny,\\r\\nThiaucourt and Vieville.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe salient was wiped out, and the St. Mihiel front reduced from forty\\r\\nto twenty miles. Secretary Newton D. Baker, accompanied by Generals\\r\\nPershing and Petain, visited St. Mihiel a few hours after its capture.\\r\\nThey walked through the streets of the city, and heard many stories of\\r\\nthe long German occupation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the attack proceeded it became more and more evident that the German\\r\\ndefense had lost heart. Thousands of them surrendered, declaring they\\r\\ndid not care to fight any more. It was also noted that a surprisingly\\r\\nlarge number of officers were among those captured. The only serious\\r\\nresistance was to the attack south of Fresnes, which was obviously for\\r\\nthe purpose of protecting the German retreat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first American regiment stationed in the St. Mihiel sector was the\\r\\n370th Infantry, formerly the Eighth Illinois, a Negro regiment officered\\r\\nentirely by soldiers of that race. This regiment was one of the three\\r\\nthat occupied a sector at Verdun when a penetration there by the Germans\\r\\nwould have been disastrous to the Allied cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe St. Mihiel salient had no great military value to the Germans, and\\r\\nwas probably held by them from a sentimental motive. It represented the\\r\\ndesperate efforts made by the Crown Prince in his early drive against\\r\\nVerdun. Its destruction, however, was of great importance to the French.\\r\\nIt was not only a removal of a menace to the French citizens of Verdun,\\r\\nbut it released the French armies at that point for active offensive\\r\\noperation. It also liberated the railway line from Verdun to Nancy,\\r\\nwhich was of the utmost value to General Pershing and the French armies\\r\\nto his left. It also later developed that the French command regarded\\r\\nthe reduction of the St. Mihiel salient as the corner stone of a great\\r\\nencircling movement aimed at the German fortress of Metz. The moral\\r\\neffect of its reduction was also notable as it was one more sign of the\\r\\nweakening of the Germans.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map: Verdun in the Northwest corner, St. Mihiel in\\r\\nSouthwest, Metz in the Northeast]\\r\\n  HOW THE ST. MIHIEL SALIENT LOOKED SHORTLY AFTER THE ASSAULT BEGAN\\r\\n  The map indicates the beginning of the great American drive, assisted\\r\\n  by the French, in 1918, which resulted in the wiping out of the huge\\r\\n  salient. The Americans attacked on the south, the French in the north;\\r\\n  dotted lines indicate the advance in the first five hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHistory usually concerns itself with the deeds of humanity in the mass\\r\\nand with the leaders of these masses. It is eminently fitting, however,\\r\\nthat this history should record the impressions made upon the mind of an\\r\\nAmerican soldier by a modern battle. The United States Government\\r\\nsingled out of all the letters received from the front, that written by\\r\\nMajor Robert L. Denig, of Philadelphia, to his wife. The letter is now\\r\\npart of the archives of the War Department, and occupies the highest\\r\\nplace of literary honor in the records of the Marines. It describes the\\r\\noperation against the Germans on the Marne on July 18th, 1918. This was\\r\\nthe counter-attack led by the Marines which broke the back of the German\\r\\ninvasion. Major Denig wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day before we left for this big push we had a most interesting fight\\r\\nbetween a fleet of German planes and a French observation balloon, right\\r\\nover our heads. We saw five planes circle over our town, then put on,\\r\\nwhat we thought afterwards, a sham fight. One of them, after many fancy\\r\\nstunts, headed right for the balloon. They were all painted with our\\r\\ncolors except one. This one went near the balloon. One kept right on.\\r\\nThe other four shot the balloon up with incendiary bullets. The\\r\\nobservers jumped into their parachutes just as the outfit went up in a\\r\\nmass of flame.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day we took our positions at various places to wait for camions\\r\\nthat were to take us somewhere in France, when or for what purpose we\\r\\ndid not know. Wass passed me at the head of his company--we made a date\\r\\nfor a party on our next leave. He was looking fine and was as happy as\\r\\ncould be. Then Hunt, Keyser and a heap of others went by. I have the\\r\\nbattalion and Holcomb the regiment. Our turn to en-buss did not come\\r\\nuntil near midnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe at last got under way after a few big \"sea bags\" had hit nearby.\\r\\nWilmer and I led in a touring car. We went at a good clip and nearly got\\r\\nditched in a couple of new shell holes. Shells were falling fast by now,\\r\\nand as the tenth truck went under the bridge a big one landed near with\\r\\na crash, and wounded the two drivers, killed two marines and wounded\\r\\nfive more. We did not know it at the time, and did not notice anything\\r\\nwrong till we came to a crossroad when we found we had only eleven cars\\r\\nall told. We found the rest of the convoy after a hunt, but even then\\r\\nwere not told of the loss, and did not find it out until the next day.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were finally, after twelve hours\\' ride, dumped in a big field and\\r\\nafter a few hours\\' rest started our march. It was hot as Hades and we\\r\\nhad had nothing to eat since the day before. We at last entered a\\r\\nforest; troops seemed to converge on it from all points. We marched some\\r\\nsix miles in the forest, a finer one I have never seen--deer would\\r\\nscamper ahead and we could have eaten one raw. At 10 that night without\\r\\nfood, we lay down in a pouring rain to sleep. Troops of all kinds passed\\r\\nus in the night--a shadowy stream, over a half-million men. Some French\\r\\nofficers told us that they had never seen such concentration since\\r\\nVerdun, if then.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day, the 18th of July, we marched ahead through a jam of\\r\\ntroops, trucks, etc., and came at last to a ration dump where we fell to\\r\\nand ate our heads off for the first time in nearly two days. When we\\r\\nleft there, the men had bread stuck on their bayonets. I lugged a ham.\\r\\nAll were loaded down.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere I passed one of Wass\\' lieutenants with his hand wounded. He was\\r\\npleased as Punch and told us the drive was on, the first we knew of it.\\r\\nI then passed a few men of Hunt\\'s company, bringing prisoners to the\\r\\nrear. They had a colonel and his staff. They were well dressed, cleaned\\r\\nand polished, but mighty glum looking.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe finally stopped at the far end of the forest near a dressing station,\\r\\nwhere Holcomb again took command. This station had been a big fine stone\\r\\nfarm but was now a complete ruin--wounded and dead lay all about. Joe\\r\\nMurray came by with his head all done up--his helmet had saved him. The\\r\\nlines had gone on ahead so we were quite safe. Had a fine aero battle\\r\\nright over us. The stunts that those planes did cannot be described by\\r\\nme.\\r\\n\\r\\nLate in the afternoon we advanced again. Our route lay over an open\\r\\nfield covered with dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe lay down on a hillside for the night near some captured German guns,\\r\\nand until dark I watched the cavalry--some four thousand, come up and\\r\\ntake positions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 3.30 the next morning Sitz woke me up and said we were to attack. The\\r\\nregiment was soon under way and we picked our way under cover of a gas\\r\\ninfested valley to a town where we got our final instructions and left\\r\\nour packs. I wished Sumner good luck and parted.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe formed up in a sunken road on two sides of a valley that was\\r\\nperpendicular to the enemy\\'s front; Hughes right, Holcomb left, Sibley\\r\\nsupport. We now began to get a few wounded; one man with ashen face came\\r\\ncharging to the rear with shell shock. He shook all over, foamed at the\\r\\nmouth, could not speak. I put him under a tent, and he acted as if he\\r\\nhad a fit.\\r\\n\\r\\nI heard Overton call to one of his friends to send a certain pin to his\\r\\nmother if he should get hit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 8.30 we jumped off with a line of tanks in the lead. For two \"kilos\"\\r\\nthe four lines of Marines were as straight as a die, and their advance\\r\\nover the open plain in the bright sunlight was a picture I shall never\\r\\nforget. The fire got hotter and hotter, men fell, bullets sung, shells\\r\\nwhizzed-banged and the dust of battle got thick. Overton was hit by a\\r\\nbig piece of shell and fell. Afterwards I heard he was hit in the heart,\\r\\nso his death was without pain. He was buried that night and the pin\\r\\nfound.\\r\\n\\r\\nA man near me was cut in two. Others when hit would stand, it seemed, an\\r\\nhour, then fall in a heap. I yelled to Wilmer that each gun in the\\r\\nbarrage worked from right to left, then a rabbit ran ahead and I watched\\r\\nhim wondering if he would get hit. Good rabbit--it took my mind off the\\r\\ncarnage. Looked for Hughes way over to the right; told Wilmer that I had\\r\\na hundred dollars and be sure to get it. You think all kinds of things.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout sixty Germans jumped out of a trench and tried to surrender, but\\r\\ntheir machine guns opened up, we fired back, they ran and our left\\r\\ncompany after them. That made a gap that had to be filled, so Sibley\\r\\nadvanced one of his to do the job, then a shell lit in a machine-gun\\r\\ncrew of ours and cleaned it out completely.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 10.30 we dug in--the attack just died out. I found a hole or old\\r\\ntrench and when I was flat on my back I got some protection. Holcomb was\\r\\nnext to me; Wilmer some way off. We then tried to get reports. Two\\r\\ncompanies we never could get in touch with. Lloyd came in and reported\\r\\nhe was holding some trenches near a mill with six men. Cates, with his\\r\\ntrousers blown off, said he had sixteen men of various companies;\\r\\nanother officer on the right reported he had and could see forty men,\\r\\nall told. That, with the headquarters, was all we could find out about\\r\\nthe battalion of nearly 800. Of the twenty company officers who went in,\\r\\nthree came out, and one, Cates, was slightly wounded.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom then on to about 8 P. M. life was a chance and mighty\\r\\nuncomfortable. It was hot as a furnace, no water, and they had our range\\r\\nto a \"T.\" Three men lying in a shallow trench near me were blown to\\r\\nbits.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went to the left of the line and found eight wounded men in a shell\\r\\nhole. I went back to Cates\\' hole and three shells landed near them. We\\r\\nthought they were killed, but they were not hit. You could hear men\\r\\ncalling for help in the wheat fields. Their cries would get weaker and\\r\\nweaker and die out. The German planes were thick in the air; they were\\r\\nin groups of from three to twenty. They would look us over and then we\\r\\nwould get a pounding. One of our planes got shot down; he fell about a\\r\\nthousand feet, like an arrow, and hit in the field back of us. The tank\\r\\nexploded and nothing was left.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had a machine gun officer with us and at six a runner came up and\\r\\nreported that Sumner was killed. He commanded the machine-gun company\\r\\nwith us. He was hit early in the fight by a bullet, I hear; I can get no\\r\\ndetails. At the start he remarked: \"This looks easy--they do not seem to\\r\\nhave much art.\" Hughes\\' headquarters were all shot up. Turner lost a\\r\\nleg.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, we just lay there all through the hot afternoon.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was great--a shell would land near by and you would bounce in your\\r\\nhole.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs twilight came, we sent out water parties for the relief of the\\r\\nwounded. Then we wondered if we would get relieved. At 9 o\\'clock we got\\r\\na message congratulating us and saying the Algerians would take over at\\r\\nmidnight. We then began to collect our wounded. Some had been evacuated\\r\\nduring the day, but at that, we soon had about twenty on the field near\\r\\nus. A man who had been blinded wanted me to hold his hand. Another,\\r\\nwounded in the back, wanted his head patted, and so it went; one man got\\r\\nup on his hands and knees. I asked him what he wanted. He said, \"Look at\\r\\nthe full moon,\" then fell dead. I had him buried, and all the rest I\\r\\ncould find. All the time bullets sung and we prayed that shelling would\\r\\nnot start until we had our wounded on top.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Algerians came up at midnight and we pushed out. They went over at\\r\\ndaybreak and got all shot up. We made the relief under German flares and\\r\\nthe light from a burning town.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went out as we came, through the gulley and town, the latter by now\\r\\nall in ruins. The place was full of gas, so we had to wear our masks. We\\r\\npushed on to the forest and fell down in our tracks and slept all day.\\r\\nThat afternoon a German plane got a balloon and the observer jumped and\\r\\nlanded in a high tree. It was some job getting him down. The wind came\\r\\nup and we had to dodge falling trees and branches. As it was, we lost--\\r\\ntwo killed and one wounded from that cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat night the Germans shelled us and got three killed and seventeen\\r\\nwounded. We moved a bit further back to the crossroad and after burying\\r\\na few Germans, some of whom showed signs of having been wounded before,\\r\\nwe settled down to a short stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt looked like rain, and so Wilmer and I went to an old dressing station\\r\\nto salvage some cover. We collected a lot of bloody shelter halves and\\r\\nponchos that had been tied to poles to make stretchers, and were about\\r\\nto go, when we stopped to look at a new grave. A rude cross made of two\\r\\nslats from a box had written on it:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lester S. Wass, Captain U. S. Marines, July 18, 1918\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old crowd at St. Nazaire and Bordeaux, Wass and Sumner killed,\\r\\nBaston and Hunt wounded, the latter on the 18th, a clean wound, I hear,\\r\\nthrough the left shoulder. We then moved further to the rear and camped\\r\\nfor the night. Dunlap came to look us over. His car was driven by a\\r\\nsailor who got out to talk to a few of the marines, when one of the\\r\\nlatter yelled out, \"Hey, fellows! Anyone want to see a real live gob,\\r\\nright this way.\" The gob held a regular reception. A carrier pigeon\\r\\nperched on a tree with a message. We decided to shoot him. It was then\\r\\nquite dark, so the shot missed. I then heard the following as I tried to\\r\\nsleep: \"Hell; he only turned around;\" \"Send up a flare;\" \"Call for a\\r\\nbarrage,\" etc. The next day further to the rear still, a Ford was towed\\r\\nby with its front wheels on a truck.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are now back in a town for some rest and to lick our wounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I rode down the battalion, where once companies 250 strong used to\\r\\nmarch, now you see fifty men, with a kid second lieutenant in command;\\r\\none company commander is not yet twenty-one.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the last attack I cashed in the gold you gave me and sent it home\\r\\nalong with my back pay. I have no idea of being \"bumped off\" with money\\r\\non my person, as if you fall into the enemy\\'s hands you are first robbed\\r\\nthen buried perhaps, but the first is sure.\\r\\n\\r\\nBaston, the lieutenant that went to Quantico with father and myself, and\\r\\nof whom father took some pictures, was wounded in both legs in the Bois\\r\\nde Belleau. He nearly lost his legs, I am told, but is coming out O. K.\\r\\nHunt was wounded in the last attack, got his wounds fixed up and went\\r\\nback again till he had to be sent out. Coffenburg was hit in the\\r\\nhand,--all near him were killed. Talbot was hit twice, but is about\\r\\nagain. That accounts for all the officers in the company that I brought\\r\\nover. In the first fight 103 of the men in that outfit were killed or\\r\\nwounded. The second fight must have about cleaned out the old crowd.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tanks, as they crushed their way through the wet, gray forest looked\\r\\nto me like beasts of the pre-stone age.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the afternoon as I lay on my back in a hole that I dug deeper, the\\r\\ndark gray German planes with their sinister black crosses, looked like\\r\\nDeath hovering above. They were for many. Sumner, for one. He was always\\r\\nsaying, \"Denig, let\\'s go ashore!\" Then here was Wass, whom I usually\\r\\ntook dinner with--dead, too. Sumner, Wass, Baston and Hunt--the old\\r\\ncrowd that stuck together; two dead, one may never be any good any more;\\r\\nHunt, I hope, will be as good as ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe officers mentioned in Major Denig\\'s letter, with their addresses and\\r\\nnext of kin, are:\\r\\n\\r\\nLieutenant Colonel Berton W.

General Foch, who had\\r\\nbeen yielding territory for several months in the great German drives,\\r\\nnow assumed the offensive himself and began the series of great drives\\r\\nwhich was to crush the German power and drive the enemy in defeat\\r\\nheadlong from France.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first of these great blows was the one which began with the\\r\\nappearance of the Americans at Chateau-Thierry. The Germans had formed a\\r\\nhuge salient whose eastern extremity lay near Rheims, and its western\\r\\nextremity west of Soissons. It was like a great pocket reaching down in\\r\\nthe direction of Paris from those two points. Against this salient the\\r\\nFrench and Americans had directed a tremendous thrust. The Germans\\r\\nresisted with desperation. It was the turning point of the war, but they\\r\\nwere compelled to yield. Town after town was regained by the French and\\r\\nAmerican troops, until, by August 5th, the Crown Prince had been driven\\r\\nfrom the Marne to the Vesle, and the salient obliterated.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 7th General Foch delivered his second blow. During the\\r\\nfighting on the Marne it had often been wondered by those who were\\r\\nobserving the great French general\\'s strategy, why the British seemed to\\r\\nmake no move. Occasionally there had been reports of minor assaults,\\r\\neither on the Lys salient, far north, or on the Somme and Montdidier\\r\\nsectors, lying between. It had not been noticed that in these minor\\r\\nassaults the English had been obtaining positions of strategic\\r\\nimportance, and that they were steadily getting ready for an English\\r\\noffensive.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut their time had now come, and on August 7th the armies of Sir Douglas\\r\\nHaig began an attack against the armies of Prince Rupprecht on the Lys\\r\\nsalient. This was followed, on August 8th, by another still greater\\r\\nAllied advance in Picardy, between Albert and Montdidier.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth of these attacks met with notable success. On the Lys salient the\\r\\nEnglish penetrated a distance of one thousand yards over a four-mile\\r\\nfront, and followed up this advance by persistent attacks which led to\\r\\nthe reoccupation, on August 19th, of Merville, and on August 31st, of\\r\\nMont Kemmel. On this front the Germans had weakened their strength by\\r\\nwithdrawing troops to aid other parts of their front, and the British\\r\\nwere constantly taking advantage of this weakening.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Germans had found this salient a failure. It had failed to attain\\r\\nits objective, the flanking of the Lens line south. They therefore were\\r\\nsteadily retreating without any intention other than to extricate\\r\\nthemselves from positions of no value, in the most economical manner.\\r\\nThe quick operations of the British, however, led to the capture of many\\r\\nprisoners and guns.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe English offensive in Picardy was a more serious matter, and from\\r\\nsome points of view was the greatest offensive in the war. The Allied\\r\\nfront had been prepared for offensive operations by minor attacks which\\r\\nhad secured for the Allied troops dominating positions. The attack was a\\r\\nsurprise attack. The Germans were expecting local attacks but not a\\r\\nmovement of this magnitude. The surprise was increased because it was\\r\\nmade through a heavy mist which prevented observation. It was preceded\\r\\nby tremendous artillery fire which lasted for four minutes, and which\\r\\nwas followed by the charge of infantry and tanks. The German artillery\\r\\nhardly replied at all, and only the resistance of a few rifles and\\r\\nmachine guns fired vaguely through the fog met the charging troops.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attack was on a twenty-five-mile front and on the first day gained\\r\\nseven miles, captured seven thousand men and a hundred guns. On the\\r\\nfollowing day there was an advance of about five miles and seventeen\\r\\nthousand more prisoners were captured.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Germans were now retiring in great haste, blowing up ammunition\\r\\ndumps and abandoning an enormous quantity of stores of all kinds. The\\r\\nEnglish were using cavalry and airplanes, which were flying low over the\\r\\nfield and throwing the German troops into confusion. Over three hundred\\r\\nguns, including many of heavy caliber, were captured. The ground had\\r\\nbeen plowed up by shells and thousands of bodies of men and horses were\\r\\nfound lying where they fell. A feature of the attack was the swift\\r\\nwhippet tanks which advanced far ahead of the infantry lines.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph]\\r\\n  Copyright Western Newspaper Union\\r\\n  British Official Photo\\r\\n  FORWARD WITH THE TANKS AGAINST BAPAUME\\r\\n  This picture gives an excellent idea of the method of combined tank\\r\\n  and infantry attack.

Y.\\r\\n  CANADIANS IN THE GREAT CAMBRAI DRIVE\\r\\n  One of the busy scenes just preceding the victorious attack by the\\r\\n  Canadians upon Cambrai. In the center can be seen captured Germans\\r\\n  carrying in one of their wounded comrades.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the French official report occurred the following statement:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The brilliant operation which we, in concert with British troops,\\r\\nexecuted yesterday has been a surprise for the enemy. As occurred in the\\r\\noffensive of July 18th the soldiers of General Debeney have captured\\r\\nenemy soldiers engaged in the peaceful pursuit of harvesting the fields\\r\\nbehind the German lines.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBy August 10th the Germans had fallen back to a line running through\\r\\nChaulnes and Roye. Montdidier had been captured, and eleven German\\r\\ndivisions had been smashed. By August 12th the number of prisoners was\\r\\n40,000, and by the 18th the Allied front was almost in the same line as\\r\\nit was in the summer of 1916, before the battle of the Somme.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next step was to capture Bapaume and Peronne. The French, on August\\r\\n19th, captured the Lassigny Massif, and continued to press on their\\r\\nattack. Noyon fell on the 29th, Roye on the 27th, Chaulnes on the 29th.\\r\\nFurther north the British had captured Albert, and on the 29th occupied\\r\\nBapaume. On September 1st they took Peronne with two thousand prisoners.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe advance still continued, and the German weakness was becoming more\\r\\nand more apparent. On September 6th the whole Allied line swept forward,\\r\\nwith an average penetration of eight miles. Chauny was captured and the\\r\\nfortress of Ham. On September 17th the British were close to St. Quentin\\r\\nand the French in their own old intrenchments before La Fere. On\\r\\nSeptember 18th a surprise advance over a twenty-two-mile front crossed\\r\\nthe Hindenburg line at two points north of St. Quentin, Villeret and\\r\\nfrom Pontru to Hollom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first and third British armies, a little further to the north, were\\r\\nmoving toward Cambrai and Douai, threatening not only them, but to get\\r\\nin the rear of Lens. This force proceeded up the Albert-Bapaume highway,\\r\\nand on August 27th captured a considerable portion of the Hindenburg\\r\\nline. On the 30th they reached Bullecourt and on September 2d crossed\\r\\nthe Drocourt-Queant line on a six-mile-front. This was the famous switch\\r\\nline, meant to supplement the Hindenburg line and its capture meant the\\r\\ncomplete overthrow of the German intrenched positions at this point.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: MAP: Arras in the Southwest corner, Douai in the\\r\\nNortheast.]\\r\\n  THE FAMOUS HINDENBURG LINE THAT CRUMBLED IN 1918.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Germans retreated hastily to the Canal du Nord, and on September 3d\\r\\nQueant was captured by an advance on a twenty mile front, along with ten\\r\\nthousand prisoners. The Allied forces were moving steadily forward. On\\r\\nSeptember 18th the British reached the defenses of Cambrai and were\\r\\nencircling the city of St. Quentin. On October 3d the advance upon\\r\\nCambrai forced the Germans to evacuate the Lens coal fields, and on\\r\\nOctober 9th another advance over a thirty-mile front enabled the Allies\\r\\nto occupy Cambrai and St. Quentin. On the 11th they had reached the\\r\\nsuburbs of Douai. By this time the whole of the Picardy salient had been\\r\\nwiped out.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe preceding summary of this great movement gives little idea of the\\r\\ntremendous struggle which had gone on during these two critical months,\\r\\nand hardly does more than suggest the tremendous importance of the\\r\\nBritish operations. The Hindenburg line was like a great fortification,\\r\\nand for more than a year had been regarded as impregnable. At Bullecourt\\r\\nthere were two main lines. One hundred and twenty-five yards in front of\\r\\nthe first line was a belt of wire twenty-five feet broad, so thick that\\r\\nit could not be seen through. The line itself contained double\\r\\nmachine-gun emplacements of ferro-concrete, one hundred and twenty-five\\r\\nyards apart, with lesser emplacements between them. More belts of wire\\r\\nprotected the support line. Here a continuous tunnel had been\\r\\nconstructed at a depth of over forty feet. Every thirty-five yards there\\r\\nwere exits with flights of forty-five steps. The tunnels were roofed\\r\\nand lined and bottomed with heavy timber, and numerous rooms branched\\r\\noff. They were lighted by electricity. Large nine-inch trench mortars\\r\\nstood at the traverses and strong machine-gun positions covered the line\\r\\nfrom behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hindenburg line was really only one of a series of twenty lines,\\r\\neach connected with the others by communicating trenches. The main lines\\r\\nwere solid concrete, separated by an unending vista of wire\\r\\nentanglements. At points this barrier barbed wire extended in solid\\r\\nformation for ten miles. This tremendous system of defenses was\\r\\noriginally called by the Germans the Siegfried line, and in the spring\\r\\nof 1917 they found it wise, at points where a strong offensive was\\r\\nexpected, to fall back to it for protection. It had been their hope that\\r\\nit would prove an impassable barrier to the Allied troops, but now it\\r\\nhad been broken, and the moral effect of the British success was even\\r\\ngreater than the material.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most noticeable results of the British advance had been the\\r\\ncapture of Lens. It had been captured without a fight, because of the\\r\\nBritish threat upon its rear, but its capture was of tremendous\\r\\nimportance. Lens had been the scene of bitter fighting in the latter\\r\\npart of August, 1917, when the Canadians had specially distinguished\\r\\nthemselves. This city had been heavily fortified by the Germans who had\\r\\nrecognized its importance as being the center of the great Lens coal\\r\\nfields, and they had never given it up. It had sometimes been described\\r\\nas the strongest single position that had ever confronted the Allies on\\r\\nthe western front. It had been made a sort of citadel of reinforced\\r\\nconcrete. Even the courage and power of the Canadians had only given\\r\\nthem possession of some of its suburbs. Between these suburbs and the\\r\\nconcrete citadel were the coal pits, with their fathomless depths of\\r\\nages and the mysteries of kultural strategy. The struggle became a\\r\\nsuccession of avalanches of gas, burning oil, rifle and machine-gun\\r\\nfire. Both sides lost terrifically, but the Germans had held the town.\\r\\nNow it was given up without a blow and its great coal fields were once\\r\\nmore in possession of the French. Before retreating the Germans showed\\r\\ntheir usual destructive energy and the mines were found flooded as a\\r\\nresult of consistent and scientific use of dynamite.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe recapture of Lens was cheering news in Paris. Not the least of the\\r\\nmany sufferings of the French during the last two years of the war was\\r\\nthat which came from the scarcity of coal. Indeed, more than once during\\r\\nthose two winters coal could not be obtained at any price. These periods\\r\\nunfortunately came in the latter part of the winter, and it happened\\r\\nthey were unusual periods of intense cold. Thousands of people stayed in\\r\\nbed all day in order to keep warm. The capture of Lens, therefore, had\\r\\nbeen anxiously desired. Nearly the whole of the French coal supply had\\r\\ncome from Lens and the adjacent Bethune coal fields. The Bethune field,\\r\\nalthough steadily working, had never produced enough coal for even the\\r\\npressing necessities of the French munition works.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe news that Bapaume had fallen on August 29th brought back, especially\\r\\nto the British, memories not only of the previous year and of the great\\r\\nforward movement which, on March 17th, had swept them over Bapaume and\\r\\nPeronne, but also bitter memories of the retreat in the previous March,\\r\\nwhich had carried them back under the overwhelming German pressure. The\\r\\ncapture therefore was balm to their spirits, and an English\\r\\ncorrespondent, Mr. Philip Gibbs, who had accompanied the British on\\r\\ntheir previous advance, found officers and men full of laughter and full\\r\\nof memories.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn all sides were the battle-fields of 1916 and 1917; Mametz Wood,\\r\\nBelleville Wood, Usna Hill, Ginchy, Morval, Guillemont. The fields were\\r\\ncovered with battle debris, and yet to the English it was sacred ground\\r\\nfrom the graves of the men who fell there. Those graves still remained.\\r\\nThe British shell fire had not touched them, but as the English advanced\\r\\nthere were many bodies of gray-clad men on the roads and fields, and\\r\\ndead horses, and a litter of barbed wire, and deep shelters dug under\\r\\nbanks, and shell craters, and helmets, gas masks, and rifles thrown here\\r\\nand there by the enemy as they fled. Now it was the Germans that were\\r\\nfleeing, and fleeing hopelessly, sullen, bitter at their officers,\\r\\nimpatient of discipline.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the great differences between the attacks of the Allies in their\\r\\nlast year of the war and those of preceding years, was the increased use\\r\\nand the improved character of the tanks. The tanks were a development of\\r\\nthe war. Before the war, however, the development of the caterpillar\\r\\ntractor had suggested to a few farsighted people the possibility of\\r\\nevolving from this invention a machine capable of offensive use over\\r\\nrough country in close warfare. Experiments were made in behalf of the\\r\\nEnglish War Office for some time without practical results.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, after these experiments had resulted in various failures, a\\r\\ntype of tractor was finally designed which produced satisfactory\\r\\nresults. It was a caterpillar tractor, with an endless self-laid track,\\r\\nover which internal driving wheels could be propelled by the engines. It\\r\\nwas not until July, 1916, that the first consignment of these new\\r\\nengines of warfare arrived at the secret maneuver ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were two kinds. One called the male was armed with two Hotchkiss\\r\\nquick-fire guns, as well as with an armament of machine guns. The other\\r\\ntype, called the female, was armed only with machine guns. The male tank\\r\\nwas designed for dealing with the concrete emplacements for the German\\r\\nmachine guns. The other was more suitable for dealing with machine-gun\\r\\npersonnel and riflemen. Some time was taken in training men to use these\\r\\ntanks, for the crew of a tank must suffer a great deal of hardship on\\r\\naccount of the noise of the engine every command had to be made by\\r\\nsigns, and the motion of the tank being like that of a ship on a heavy\\r\\nsea, was likely to produce seasickness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tanks were painted with weird colors for the purpose of concealment,\\r\\nand when they first appeared caused a great deal of wonder and\\r\\namusement. They were first used in battle on September 15, 1916, in a\\r\\ncontinuation of the battle of the Somme, and proved a great surprise to\\r\\nthe Germans. The Germans directed all available rifle and machine-gun\\r\\nfire upon them without success. A correspondent narrates that: \"As the\\r\\n\\'Creme de Menthe\\' moved on its way, the bullets fell from its sides\\r\\nharmlessly. It advanced upon a broken wall, leaned up against it\\r\\nheavily, until it fell with a crash of bricks, and then rose on to the\\r\\nbricks and passed over them and walked straight into the midst of\\r\\nfactory ruins.\" They were an immense success and had come to stay.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLIV\\r\\n\\r\\nBELGIUM\\'S GALLANT EFFORT\\r\\n\\r\\nFor more than four years Belgium suffered under the iron heel of the\\r\\nGerman invaders. One little corner in the far west was occupied by her\\r\\ngallant army, fighting with the utmost courage and a patriotism which\\r\\nhas won the admiration of the world under its great King Albert, whose\\r\\nheroic leadership had turned the little commercial nation into a nation\\r\\nof heroes. Conditions of life in the Belgian cities were almost\\r\\nintolerable. The great Belgian Relief Commission, under the direction of\\r\\nMr. Hoover, had kept the people from starvation, but it could not secure\\r\\nthem their rights. They lived in the midst of brutality and injustice.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Belgian Independence Day at London, Arthur J. Balfour, the British\\r\\nForeign Minister, made an address in which he commented upon the German\\r\\ntreatment of Belgium. In the course of his address he said: \"Bitter must\\r\\nbe the thought in every Belgian heart of what Belgians in Belgium are\\r\\nnow suffering. Let them however, take courage. Let their spirits rise in\\r\\na mood of profound cheerfulness, for these dark days are not going to\\r\\nlast forever, and when they come to a conclusion, when again peace dawns\\r\\nupon this much tormented and cruelly tried world, when Belgium is again\\r\\nfree and prosperous, then Belgians, whether they have spent these\\r\\nunhappy years in exile, or, an even harder fate, have spent them in\\r\\ntheir own country, they will be able to look back upon this time of\\r\\ncruel and unexampled trial, and they will say to themselves, to their\\r\\nchildren and to their descendants, that Belgium, though her existence as\\r\\na political entity is less than a century, has within that period shown\\r\\nan example of courage, constancy and virtue to mankind for which all the\\r\\nworld should be grateful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe English Foreign Minister was perhaps not prophesying. He knew\\r\\nsomething of what was coming. The Great Offensive which was to free\\r\\nBelgium of her German oppressor was already under way. The first move,\\r\\nhowever, was not upon land, but upon the sea. In the autumn of 1914 the\\r\\nlittle Belgian port of Zeebrugge, with the neighboring port of Ostend,\\r\\nwas captured by the Germans. The Germans, who had already seized the\\r\\nshipbuilding plants at Antwerp, then began to build submarines, and sent\\r\\nthem down the canals through Bruges to Zeebrugge and Ostend. From these\\r\\nports they proceeded to attack the English commerce.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the spring of 1918 submarine attacks on English shipping were so\\r\\nserious that England was using every possible effort to destroy these\\r\\npiratical craft, and it was determined to make an attempt to block the\\r\\nentrances to the canals at Zeebrugge and at Ostend, by sinking old ships\\r\\nin the channels.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe expedition took place during the night of April 22d, under the\\r\\ncommand of Vice-Admiral Sir Roger Keyes. Six obsolete British cruisers\\r\\ntook part in the expedition. These were the Brilliant, Iphigenia,\\r\\nSirius, Intrepid, Thetis and Vindictive. The Vindictive carried storming\\r\\nparties to destroy the stone mole at Zeebrugge; the remaining five\\r\\ncruisers were filled with concrete, and it was intended that they should\\r\\nbe sunk in the entrances of the two ports. A large force of monitors and\\r\\nsmall fast craft accompanied the expedition. An observer thus describes\\r\\nthe heroic exploit:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe night was overcast and there was a drifting haze. Down the coast a\\r\\ngreat searchlight swung its beam to and fro in the small wind and short\\r\\nsea. From the Vindictive\\'s bridge, as she headed in toward the mole,\\r\\nthere was scarcely a glimmer of light to be seen shoreward. Ahead as she\\r\\ndrove through the water rolled the smoke screen, her cloak of\\r\\ninvisibility, wrapped about her by small craft. This was the device of\\r\\nWing-Commander Brock, without which, acknowledged the Admiral in\\r\\ncommand, the operation could not have been conducted. A northeast wind\\r\\nmoved the volume of it shoreward ahead of the ships. Beyond it was the\\r\\ndistant town, its defenders unsuspicious.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not until the Vindictive, with bluejackets and marines standing\\r\\nready for landing, was close upon the mole, that the wind lulled and\\r\\ncame away again from the southeast, sweeping back the smoke screen and\\r\\nlaying her bare to eyes that looked seaward, There was a moment\\r\\nimmediately afterward when it seemed to those on the ships as if the dim\\r\\nharbor exploded into light. A star shell soared aloft, then a score of\\r\\nstar shells. Wavering beams of the searchlights swung around and settled\\r\\ninto a glare. A wild fire of gun flashes leaped against the sky; strings\\r\\nof luminous green beads shot aloft, hung and sank. The darkness of the\\r\\nnight was supplemented by a nightmare daylight of battle-fired guns, and\\r\\nmachine guns along the mole. The batteries ashore woke to life.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was in a gale of shelling that the Vindictive laid her nose against\\r\\nthe thirty-foot-high concrete side of the mole, let go her anchor, and\\r\\nsignaled to the Daffodil to shove her stern in. The Iris went ahead and\\r\\nendeavored to get alongside likewise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fire was intense while the ships plunged and rolled beside the mole\\r\\nin the seas, the Vindictive, with her greater draft, jarring against the\\r\\nfoundations of the mole with every lunge. They were swept diagonally by\\r\\nmachine-gun fire from both ends of the mole and by the heavy batteries\\r\\non shore. Captain Carpenter conned the Vindictive from the open bridge\\r\\nuntil her stern was laid in, when he took up his position in the flame\\r\\nthrower hut on the port side. It is marvelous that any occupant should\\r\\nhave survived a minute in this hut, so riddled and shattered was it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe officer of the Iris, which was in trouble ahead of the Vindictive,\\r\\ndescribed Captain Carpenter as handling her like a picket boat. The\\r\\nVindictive was fitted along her port side with a high, false deck, from\\r\\nwhich ran eighteen brows, or gangways, by which the storming and\\r\\ndemolition parties were to land. The men gathered in readiness on the\\r\\nmain lower decks, while Colonel Elliott, who was to lead the marines,\\r\\nwaited on the false deck just abaft the bridge. Captain Hallahan, who\\r\\ncommanded the bluejackets, was amidships. The word for the assault had\\r\\nnot yet been given when both leaders were killed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mere landing on the mole was a perilous business. It involved a\\r\\npassage across the crashing and splintering gangways, a drop over the\\r\\nparapet into the field of fire of the German machine-guns which swept\\r\\nits length, and a further drop of some sixteen feet to the surface of\\r\\nthe mole itself. Many were killed and more wounded as they crowded up\\r\\nthe gangways, but nothing hindered the orderly and speedy landing by\\r\\nevery gangway. The lower deck was a shambles, as the commander made the\\r\\nround of the ship, yet the wounded and dying raised themselves to cheer\\r\\nas he made his tour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Iris had trouble of her own. Her first attempts to make fast to the\\r\\nmole ahead of the Vindictive failed, as her grapnels were not large\\r\\nenough to span the parapet. Two officers, Lieutenant-Commander Bradford,\\r\\nand Lieutenant Hawkins, climbed ashore and sat astride the parapet\\r\\ntrying to make the grapnels fast, till each was killed, and fell down\\r\\nbetween the ship and the wall. Commander Valentine Gibbs had both legs\\r\\nshot away, and died next morning. Lieutenant Spencer though wounded,\\r\\ntook command and refused to be relieved.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Layout of harbor; North sea at top, with lighthouse, quay\\r\\nand wireless station. Foreground shows harbor facilities and submarine\\r\\npens.]\\r\\n  ZEEBRUGGE HARBOR, BLOCKED BY BRITISH\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Iris was obliged at last to change her position and fall in astern\\r\\nof the Vindictive, which suffered very heavily from fire. Her total\\r\\ncasualties were eight officers and sixty-nine men killed, and three\\r\\nofficers and 103 men wounded.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe storming parties upon the mole met with no resistance from the\\r\\nGermans other than an intense and unremitting fire. One after another\\r\\nbuildings burst into flames, or split and crumbled as dynamite went off.\\r\\nA bombing party working up toward the mole in search of the enemy\\r\\ndestroyed several machine gun emplacements but not a single prisoner\\r\\nawarded them. It appears that upon the approach of the ships and with\\r\\nthe opening of fire the enemy simply retired and contented themselves\\r\\nwith bringing machine guns to the short end of the mole.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe object of the fighting on the mole was in large part to divert the\\r\\nenemy\\'s attention while the work of blocking the canals was being\\r\\naccomplished.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf this operation the official narrative says: \"The Thetis came first\\r\\nsteaming into a tornado of shells from great batteries ashore. All her\\r\\ncrew save a remnant who remained to steam her in and sink her, already\\r\\nhad been taken off her by a ubiquitous motor launch. The remnant spared\\r\\nhands enough to keep her four guns going. It was hers to show the road\\r\\nto the Intrepid and Iphigenia which followed. She cleared a string of\\r\\narmed barges, which defends the channel from the tip of the mole, but\\r\\nhad the ill-fortune to foul one of her propellers upon a net defense\\r\\nwhich flanks it on the shore side. The propeller gathered in the net and\\r\\nit rendered her practically unmanageable. Shore batteries found her and\\r\\npounded her unremittingly. She bumped into the bank, edged off and found\\r\\nherself in the channel again, still some hundreds of yards from the\\r\\nmouth of the canal in practically a sinking condition. As she lay she\\r\\nsignaled invaluable directions to others, and her commander blew charges\\r\\nand sank it. Motor launches took off her crew. The Intrepid, smoking\\r\\nlike a volcano, and with all her guns blazing, followed. Her motor\\r\\nlaunch had failed to get alongside, outside the harbor, and she had men\\r\\nenough for anything. Straight into the canal she steered, her smoke\\r\\nblowing back from her into the Iphigenia\\'s eyes so that the latter was\\r\\nblinded, and going a little wild, ran into the dredger, with her barge\\r\\nmoored beside it, which lay at the western arm of the canal. She was not\\r\\nclear though, and entered the canal, pushing the barge before her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was then that a shell hit the steam connections of her whistle and\\r\\nthe escape of steam which followed drove off some of the smoke, and let\\r\\nher see what she was doing. Lieutenant Carter, commanding the Intrepid,\\r\\nplaced the nose of his ship neatly on the mud of the western bank,\\r\\nordered his crew away, and blew up his ship by switches in the chart\\r\\nroom. Lieutenant Leake, commanding the Iphigenia, beached her according\\r\\nto arrangement on the eastern side, blew her up, saw her drop nicely\\r\\nacross the canal, and left her with her engines still going to hold her\\r\\nin position till she should have bedded well down on the bottom.\\r\\nAccording to the latest reports from air observation the two old ships,\\r\\nwith their holds full of concrete, are lying across the canal in a\\r\\nV-position, and it is probable that the work they set out to do has been\\r\\naccomplished and that the canal is effectively blocked.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Ostend an attempt was also made to block the canal on the same night,\\r\\nbut it was unsuccessful owing to a shift of wind which blew away the\\r\\nsmoke screen behind which the British craft were acting, and enabled the\\r\\nGerman gun fire to destroy the flares which had been lit to mark the\\r\\nentrance to the harbor. The cruisers tried to act by guess work, and one\\r\\nof the block ships was sunk, but it was not in a position to obstruct\\r\\nthe canal.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 9th another attempt was made, and the Vindictive, filled with\\r\\nconcrete was sunk in the Ostend channel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis daring exploit of the English fleet, though it had destroyed the\\r\\nvalue of Zeebrugge and Ostend as submarine bases, had left the Germans\\r\\nin possession. In September, however, General Foch determined that the\\r\\ntime had come to throw his armies against the German forces in the\\r\\ndistracted little country. He planned two widely separated thrusts. On\\r\\nthe south he sent Pershing against the Germans between the Argonne and\\r\\nthe Meuse. They made rapid progress, capturing Montfaucon, Varennes and\\r\\ndriving on until they had destroyed the German control of the\\r\\nParis-Chalons-Verdun Railroad.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a serious blow to the Germans, for a further push northward\\r\\nwould cut the vital lateral railway connecting the German armies in\\r\\nBelgium and France with those in Alsace-Lorraine. Ludendorf hastened\\r\\nreserves to this front, and the American operation was slowed down.\\r\\nMeanwhile at the other end of the line the Belgians, with General\\r\\nPlumer\\'s Second British Army, suddenly attacked on a front which\\r\\nextended all the way from the canal at Dixmude to the Lys, swept the\\r\\nGermans out of all the famous fighting ground of the Ypres salient,\\r\\npushed across the Passchendaele Ridge and down into the Flanders plain\\r\\nbelow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe situation of the Germans in the Lille regions of the south and also\\r\\nalong the Belgian coast became at once dangerous. Once more Ludendorf\\r\\nwas compelled to send reserves, and this thrust began to slow up but it\\r\\nwas not checked permanently, and the Belgian armies were to move on.\\r\\nWhile this advance was being conducted the British fleet were bombarding\\r\\nthe coastal defenses. The Belgian army, fighting with the utmost spirit\\r\\nunder command of King Albert, made a penetration of five miles and\\r\\ncaptured four thousand prisoners and an immense amount of supplies.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 30th they captured the city of Roulers. For ten days there\\r\\nwas a consolidation of position by the Allies, but on October 14th they\\r\\nmade a furious attack in the general direction of Ghent and Courtrai.\\r\\nThousands of prisoners and several complete batteries of guns were\\r\\ncaptured. In this attack British, Belgian and French troops took part,\\r\\nand the troops of the three nations went over the top without\\r\\npreliminary bombardment, taking the enemy by surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 15th the news from Flanders showed that the victory was\\r\\ngrowing in extent, the Allied armies were advancing on a front of about\\r\\ntwenty-five miles, and in some places had penetrated the enemy\\'s\\r\\npositions six or seven miles. The Belgians had captured seven thousand\\r\\nprisoners and the British and French about four thousand. In French\\r\\nFlanders the British advanced to a point about three miles west of\\r\\nLille.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe battle was carried on in a heavy rain which turned the battle-fields\\r\\ninto seas of mud; while this hampered the Allied troops it hindered even\\r\\nmore the Germans in trying to move away their material through the mired\\r\\nground of the Flanders Lowland.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the next day dispatches indicated that a retreat on a tremendous\\r\\nscale in northern Belgium was under way. The Germans were retreating so\\r\\nfast that the Allies lost touch with the enemy. The gallant little\\r\\nBelgian army, assisted by crack British and French troops, had driven\\r\\nthe despoilers of its country from a large section which the Germans had\\r\\noccupied since the early days of the war, and had gained positions of\\r\\nsuch importance as to make it probable that the Germans would have to\\r\\nabandon the entire coast of Belgium.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, on the south, the city of Lille, with the great mining and\\r\\nmanufacturing districts around it, was being left in a salient which was\\r\\ngrowing deeper every hour and which the enemy could not hope to hold. At\\r\\ncertain points the resistance of the Germans was extraordinarily fierce.\\r\\nThis was especially true in the region of Thouret. The battle here was\\r\\nfrom street to street and from house to house. The Germans had placed\\r\\nmachine-guns in the windows of houses and cellars and fired murderous\\r\\nstreams of bullets into the advancing Belgians but were unable to stop\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Belgians fought with a dogged determination such as only troops\\r\\nfighting to regain their outraged country could display. Nothing could\\r\\nstop them. At other points, especially in the northern part of the\\r\\nbattle area, the Germans surrendered freely. Many civilians were rescued\\r\\nfrom the towns and districts captured, and little processions of these\\r\\nwere straggling rearward out of range of the guns, and out of the way of\\r\\nthe fighting troops. At times liberated Belgian women could see their\\r\\nsons, brothers or husbands going forward into battle. On October 17th\\r\\nthe German retreat in Flanders became a rout. The enemy were fleeing\\r\\nrapidly on their entire front. The British entered Lille.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Germans fled from Ostend and British naval forces were landed there.\\r\\nThe Belgian infantry were sweeping up the coast, and Belgian patrols\\r\\nentered Bruges. In the afternoon of the day King Albert of Belgium, and\\r\\nQueen Elizabeth entered Ostend. The splendid fighting of the Belgian\\r\\ntroops and their magnificent victory was now attracting universal\\r\\nattention. It was one of the revelations of the war. They were bearing\\r\\nthe giant\\'s share of the work of the Allied armies in their own country,\\r\\nand had already liberated territory which more than doubled the area of\\r\\nthat part of Belgium which had been in their possession.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the Belgian coast cleared of invaders it became open to British\\r\\ntransports which would afford relief to the whole Allied armies from the\\r\\nresultant decrease in the congestion of the channel ports. On October\\r\\n19th the progress continued. Zeebrugge was occupied by the Allies, the\\r\\nlast Belgian port remaining in German hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Belgian advance continued along the whole line. King Albert entered\\r\\nBruges. Day after day the advance continued. The reception of the King\\r\\nand Queen of Belgium in the recovered towns was something to remember.\\r\\nIn Bruges they rode in amid the tumultuous cheering of the frenzied\\r\\npopulation. On the central square they were received by the burgomaster\\r\\nwith an escort of a solitary gendarme, who had refused to give up his\\r\\nuniform and old-fashioned rifle to the enemy; though fined and\\r\\nimprisoned he had kept their hiding place secret. As he stood there\\r\\nalone with fixed bayonet the King and the Queen shook him by the hand\\r\\nand congratulated him. Greatly moved, he stammered, \"It is too great an\\r\\nhonor, too great an honor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with all this happiness came the happiness arising from the return\\r\\nof the soldiers to the homes from which they had been absent so long,\\r\\nthe reunions of husband and wife, of parents and children. Belgium was\\r\\nnow to reap the reward for her heroism.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLV\\r\\n\\r\\nITALY\\'S TERRIFIC DRIVE\\r\\n\\r\\nFor many months after the great Italian stand on the Piave there was\\r\\ninactivity on both fronts in Italy. The Italians had been reinforced by\\r\\ntroops from France and Great Britain and their own army was now larger\\r\\nthan it had been at any other time. On June 15th, about the time when\\r\\nthe Germans were being driven back on the Marne and the Oise, the\\r\\nAustrians, urged to action by the Germans, suddenly undertook a great\\r\\noffensive on a front from the Asiago Plateau to the sea, a distance of\\r\\nninety-seven miles.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the very start it was plain that the Italians were resisting\\r\\nmagnificently. The offensive was not unexpected, either in time or\\r\\nlocality, and had been openly discussed in the Italian press. The\\r\\nItalians therefore were not taken by surprise, and moreover since the\\r\\ndisaster of Caparetto the Italians had learned by a patient campaign of\\r\\neducation what they were fighting for.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the second day of the battle the Austrian troops made a desperate\\r\\neffort to break through the Italian lines, particularly in the eastern\\r\\nsector of the Asiago Plateau, and crossed the Piave River at two places.\\r\\nThey also attacked the French positions between Osteria di Monfenera and\\r\\nMaranzine, but were driven back with heavy loss. At every point where\\r\\nthe Austrians were able to advance the Italians initiated vigorous\\r\\ncounter-attacks. The order to Italy\\'s army was, \"Hold at any cost.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the third day of the battle the Austrian offensive was being strongly\\r\\nchecked. They had established three bridgeheads on the Piave, but had\\r\\nnot been able to advance. The most notable of these crossings was that\\r\\nin the Montello sector. Montello is of particular importance, because it\\r\\nis the hinge between the mountains and the Piave sectors of the Italian\\r\\nfront. If it could be held the Austrians would be in a position to\\r\\ndominate from the flank and rear all the Italian positions defending the\\r\\nline of the Piave in the dead flat plain to the south.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Painting]\\r\\n  STORMING THE MOLE AT ZEEBRUGGE\\r\\n  One of the most brilliant and spectacular feats in naval history was\\r\\n  the British blocking of the submarine harbor at Zeebrugge. The picture\\r\\n  shows one of the detachments of marines that braved the terrific\\r\\n  German defense fire and swarmed up the mole that protects the harbor,\\r\\n  planting explosives that made a great breach and let the tides in.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph]\\r\\n  ITALIAN TROOPS TREKKING THE SNOW-FIELDS OF THE ALPS\\r\\n  The Alpine troops of the Italian army have for years developed a\\r\\n  military technique peculiar to the regions they must cover. Here a\\r\\n  battalion of Alpini is seen on skis, the best method for traveling\\r\\n  over the frozen snow crusts of the mountain region.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the Lower Piave the Austrians had made gains and had captured Capo\\r\\nSile. The Austrians were using a million men and were using liquid fire\\r\\nand gas bombs, but their every move was resisted strongly. Vienna was\\r\\nclaiming the capture of 30,000 men, but the Italian reports claimed that\\r\\nthe Austrian losses were stupendous. Thousands of dead were heaped\\r\\nbefore the Italian line in the mountain sectors, blocking the mule paths\\r\\nand choking the defiles. No fewer than nine desperate onslaughts upon\\r\\nMonte Grappa, always with fresh reserves, were broken upon Grappa\\r\\nheights, with terrific losses.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 19th the dispatches from Rome were emphasizing the Italian\\r\\ncounter-attacks. Not only were the Italians preventing the enemy from\\r\\nmaking further gains, but they were beginning to crowd him back at the\\r\\npoints where he had crossed the river, and were raining bombs and\\r\\nmachine-gun bullets upon the Austrian troops at the bridgehead. They\\r\\nwere also taking the initiative in the fighting in the mountain sectors.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy June 20th the Austrian defeat was clear. Their forces were backed\\r\\nagainst the flooded Piave, which had carried away their bridges and left\\r\\nthem to the mercy of the Italians. Thousands were being killed and other\\r\\nthousands captured. Czecho-Slovak troops, it was reported, had joined in\\r\\nthe fighting, and had given their first tribute of blood to the generous\\r\\nprinciples of freedom and independence for which they were in arms. In\\r\\nthe Piave delta the Italians had regained Capo Sile, which had been\\r\\ncaptured early in the drive, and it was reported that all along the\\r\\nPiave line they had won complete control of the air, not a single\\r\\nAustrian machine being still aloft. The spirits of the Austrian troops\\r\\nhad been definitely weakened. They were war wearied, and evidence began\\r\\nto accumulate that Austria\\'s drive was a \"hunger offensive.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the battle continued reports began to arrive of the gallant deeds of\\r\\nAmerican airmen, who were helping in the fighting along the front. The\\r\\nairmen were assisting in destroying the bridges that the Austrians were\\r\\ntrying to throw across the river. The Piave was now a vast cataract and\\r\\nthe bridges which it had not washed down were constantly destroyed by\\r\\nthe aviators. The Austrians on the western bank were finding it\\r\\ndifficult to obtain supplies and were resorting to hydroplanes for that\\r\\npurpose. On June 24th the Austrian attack had definitely failed and they\\r\\nwere fleeing in disorder across the Piave. One hundred and eighty\\r\\nthousand men had already been lost and forty thousand were hemmed in on\\r\\nthe western side of the river. The Austrian communications were\\r\\nemphasizing the difficulties they were meeting with through the heavy\\r\\nrains.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe victory of the Italians, which was now apparent, was received all\\r\\nover Italy with great public rejoicing. Italy had been repenting in\\r\\nsackcloth and ashes her defeat of the previous fall. Now they had made\\r\\namends and were showing what the Italian soldier could really do. In\\r\\nAmerica, and among the Allied Powers, there was great enthusiasm, and\\r\\nSecretary of War Baker sent this congratulatory message to the Italian\\r\\nMinister of War:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYour Excellency: The people of the United States are watching with\\r\\nenthusiasm and admiration the splendid exploits of the great army of\\r\\nItaly in resisting and driving back the enemy forces which recently\\r\\nundertook a major offensive on the Italian front. I take great pleasure\\r\\nin tendering my own hearty congratulations, and would be most happy to\\r\\nhave a message of greeting and congratulation transmitted to General\\r\\nDiaz and his brave soldiers.\\r\\nNEWTON D. BAKER,\\r\\nSecretary of War of the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn announcing to his victorious army the repulse of the Austrians\\r\\nGeneral Diaz, the Italian Commander-in-Chief, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The enemy who, with furious impetuosity, used all means to penetrate\\r\\nour territory has been repulsed at all points. His losses are very\\r\\nheavy. His pride is broken. Glory to all commands, all soldiers, all\\r\\nsailors.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 26th of June the Italian troops, having forced the last rear\\r\\nguard of the retreating Austrians to surrender and completely occupied\\r\\nthe west bank of the Piave, began an offensive on the mountain front in\\r\\nthe Monte Grappa sector. They gained more than 3,000 prisoners, and\\r\\nconsiderable territory. On the southern part of the Piave front they\\r\\nwere carrying on a vigorous offensive against the Austrian positions\\r\\nwithin the Piave delta. The Austrian troops, at that point, were being\\r\\nprevented from retreat by the high water, and suffered terrible losses.\\r\\nOn July 6th the Italians drove the last of the enemy from the delta.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe campaign in Italy now languished, until, on October 27th, Italy\\r\\nbegan her last terrible drive. The great Italian offensive was made not\\r\\nonly by their own forces and the French and British troops, which had\\r\\nassisted them the previous June, but during the intervening period a\\r\\nlarge force of Americans had arrived in Italy. On June 27th Secretary\\r\\nBaker had made the announcement that General Pershing had been\\r\\ninstructed to send into Italy a regiment that was then in training in\\r\\nFrance. The regiment thus sent was augmented considerably later. The\\r\\npurpose of sending troops to Italy, Mr. Baker explained, was rather\\r\\npolitical than military. It was desired to demonstrate again that the\\r\\nAllied nations and the United States were one in their purposes on all\\r\\nfronts, and to extend the intercourse between the troops of all the\\r\\npowers at war with Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the second day of the Italian offensive their success increased. More\\r\\nthan nine thousand Austrians were taken prisoners and fifty-one guns\\r\\nwere captured. The Piave River had been crossed, and the Italians had\\r\\nadvanced four miles to its east. The attacks in the mountain region were\\r\\nbeing more bitterly contested, and counter-attacks had enabled the enemy\\r\\nto regain some of their lost positions.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 30th the Italian advance was continuing. The Austrian front\\r\\nappeared to be breaking under the heavy blows of the Allied troops.\\r\\nDispatches indicated striking successes, not only on the Italian front\\r\\nbut at the points where the British and the French were holding the\\r\\nline. The Americans were being held in reserve, but American airplanes\\r\\nwere actively participating in the work at the front. By this time the\\r\\nlast lines of the Austro-Hungarian resistance on the central positions\\r\\nalong the Piave River had been broken, and more than fifteen thousand\\r\\nprisoners been taken. The Austrians, however, had been desperately\\r\\nresisting, and their artillery fire at many points was very effective,\\r\\nespecially that which had been directed at the pontoon bridges thrown\\r\\nacross the Piave.\\r\\n\\r\\nKing Victor Emanuel had been present in person during the crossing, and\\r\\nwas often under the fire of the Austrian guns. On October 30th, 33,000\\r\\nAustrians had been captured and the Italians had reached Vittorio.\\r\\nAmericans had now joined in the fighting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Austrian retreat reached the proportion of a rout. They were still\\r\\nfighting, especially in the mountain region, but in the plains east of\\r\\nthe Piave they were in full flight. Taking into consideration the\\r\\nnumbers of troops in the Austrian lines and their apparently plentiful\\r\\nsupplies, it began to seem probable that their break was due more to\\r\\npolitical maneuvers than to military force. The Austrians at this time\\r\\nwere making a great peace drive, and the dissatisfaction at home had\\r\\naffected the morale of the troops at the front. The conditions in Italy\\r\\nwere in close resemblance to those in Bulgaria just before Bulgaria\\r\\napplied for an armistice.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 1st of November the Austrians were completely routed, and were\\r\\nstreaming in confusion down the valleys of the Alpine foothills, and\\r\\nfleeing northward from the Piave. Reports from Austria indicated riots\\r\\nat Vienna and Budapest. In Vienna people were parading the streets,\\r\\nshouting \"Down with the Hapsburgs!\" On October 29th, the Austrians asked\\r\\nfor an armistice. Their announcement read as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe High Command of the armies, early Tuesday, by means of a\\r\\nParliamentaire, established communication with the Italian army command.\\r\\nEvery effort is to be made for the avoidance of further useless\\r\\nsacrifice of blood, for the cessation of hostilities, and the conclusion\\r\\nof an armistice. Toward this step which is animated by the best\\r\\nintentions the Italian High Command at first assumed an attitude of\\r\\nunmistakable refusal, and it was only on the evening of Wednesday that,\\r\\nin accord with the Italian High Command, General Weber, accompanied by a\\r\\ndeputation, was permitted to cross the fighting line for preliminary\\r\\npourparlers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Diaz, the Italian Commander, had referred the Austrian request\\r\\nto the Versailles Conference, and had acted in accordance with their\\r\\ndirection. In proposing the armistice the Austrians had also expressed\\r\\ntheir resolve to bring about peace and to evacuate the occupied\\r\\nterritory of Italy. This was the beginning of the end.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe northern part of Italy is bounded by the Alps, and between those\\r\\nlofty ranges and the deep valleys there had been constant fighting. In\\r\\nthis fighting, both on mountain and in valley, there were the most\\r\\nextraordinary deeds of individual heroism, constantly exhibited.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Alpine regiments, known in Italy as the Alpini, were men of\\r\\nextraordinary physical powers, accustomed to mountain climbing, and\\r\\nfilled with courage and patriotism. Owing to the nature of the territory\\r\\nin such contests, only a limited number of men could be used at one\\r\\ntime, and the fighting went on over masses of snow or solid rock. Guns\\r\\nwere hauled up precipices and dugouts excavated in the rock itself. The\\r\\nItalian troops, clothed in white overalls to prevent their being seen,\\r\\nmoved with great rapidity from point to point, and forced their enemy to\\r\\nkeep constantly on the alert. In the great Italian drive just described\\r\\nthe most bitter fighting was that which occurred in these mountainous\\r\\nregions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe work of the Italian aviators is also worthy of special attention.\\r\\nThey not only secured entire command of the air, but by flying low they\\r\\noften threw into confusion with their machine guns the Austrian\\r\\ninfantry. Their wonderful work in bringing in military information, and\\r\\nin bombing expeditions, was not excelled, if it was equaled, by the\\r\\nairmen of any other country. The Italian airplanes themselves were\\r\\nengineering triumphs. The inventive genius so notable in these days in\\r\\nItaly found expression in their development. Some of their machines were\\r\\nthe biggest made during the whole war, and the long journeys made by\\r\\nsuch machines deserve special mention. The most interesting feat of this\\r\\nkind was performed on August 9th by the famous poet, Captain Gabrielle\\r\\nD\\'Annunzio. Accompanied by eight Italian machines, he flew to the city\\r\\nof Vienna, a total distance of 620 miles, and dropped copies of an\\r\\nAllied manifesto over the city. They crossed the Alps in a great wind\\r\\nstorm at a height of ten thousand feet, and all but one returned safely.\\r\\nThe manifesto, which was written by D\\'Annunzio reads as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople of Vienna, you are fated to know the Italians. We are flying over\\r\\nVienna and could drop tons of bombs. On the contrary we leave a\\r\\nsalutation and the flag with its colors of liberty. We Italians do not\\r\\nmake war on children, the aged and women. We make war on your\\r\\ngovernment, which is the enemy of the liberty of nations,--on your\\r\\nblind, wanton, cruel government, which gives you neither peace nor\\r\\nbread, and nurtures you on hatred and delusions. People of Vienna, you\\r\\nhave the reputation of being intelligent, why then do you wear the\\r\\nPrussian uniform? Now you see the entire world is against you, do you\\r\\nwish to continue the war? Keep on, then, but it will be your suicide.\\r\\nWhat can you hope from the victory promised to you by the Prussian\\r\\ngenerals? Their decisive victory is like the bread of the Ukraine,--one\\r\\ndies while awaiting it. People of Vienna, think of your dear ones,\\r\\nawake! Long live Italy, Liberty and the Entente!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was said that copies of this proclamation in Vienna had a value of\\r\\nfifty dollars a copy. D\\'Annunzio\\'s great fame had seized upon the\\r\\npopular imagination. His career in the war would have been interesting\\r\\nin itself, but when one recognizes that he was already a world figure,\\r\\nthe greatest modern Italian dramatist and novelist, his life seems\\r\\nalmost like a fairy story. Before the war began he made addresses all\\r\\nover his country, urging Italy\\'s participation in the war, and when war\\r\\nwas declared, to him, as much as to any other man, was due the credit.\\r\\nHe entered the navy, and has written some fascinating descriptions of\\r\\nhis life on board ship. Later he joined the airplane corps, and now was\\r\\nshowering down upon the gaping populace of Vienna appeals to rise\\r\\nagainst its Hapsburg masters. D\\'Annunzio was extraordinary in his\\r\\nliterary career. He had been the poet of passion, a writer of novels and\\r\\nplays, which, although artistic in the highest degree, showed him to be\\r\\nan egotist and a decadent. But long before the war he had tired of his\\r\\nerotic productions and had begun to write the praises of Nature and of\\r\\nheroes. He had been singing the praises of his country. \"La Nave\"\\r\\nsymbolizes the glory of Venice. He had become more wholesome. War was\\r\\nmaking him not only a man but a hero.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course D\\'Annunzio was not the only great literary man who had left\\r\\nthe study for the battle-field. AEschylus fought at Marathon and\\r\\nSalamis; Ariosto put down a rebellion for his prince between composition\\r\\nof cantos of Orlando Furioso; Sir Philip Sydney was scholar, poet and\\r\\nsoldier, and many a soldier when his wars were over has turned to the\\r\\nlabors of the pen. Yet it is not without surprise that one sees\\r\\nD\\'Annunzio join this distinguished company, and one\\'s admiration grows\\r\\nas it becomes plain that he was not a mere poseur. He was a poet, but he\\r\\nwas a soldier too. Not every great poet could drive an airplane to\\r\\nVienna.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLVI\\r\\n\\r\\nBULGARIA DESERTS GERMANY\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the year 1916 there was little movement in the Balkans. The\\r\\nAllies had settled down at Saloniki and intrenched themselves so\\r\\nstrongly that their positions were practically impregnable. These\\r\\nintrenchments were on slopes facing north, heavily wired and with seven\\r\\nmiles of swamp before them, over which an attacking army would have to\\r\\npass. It was obviously inadvisable to withdraw entirely the armies at\\r\\nSaloniki. So long as they were there it was possible at any time to make\\r\\nan attack on Bulgaria in case Russia or Roumania should need such\\r\\nassistance. And moreover, it was evident that it was only the presence\\r\\nof the Saloniki army that kept Greece neutral. During the year there\\r\\nwere a few fights which were little more than skirmishes; almost all of\\r\\nthe German soldiers had been withdrawn, and it was chiefly the Bulgarian\\r\\narmy that was facing the Allies. On May 26th Bulgarian forces advanced\\r\\ninto Greece and occupied Fort Rupel, with the acquiescence of the Greek\\r\\nGovernment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Greeks were in a difficult position. It was not unnatural that King\\r\\nConstantine and the Greek General Staff believed that the Allies had\\r\\nsmall chance of victory. Moreover, they had no special ambitions which\\r\\ncould be satisfied by a war against the Central Powers. On the other\\r\\nhand, Turkey was an hereditary enemy, and the big sea coast would put\\r\\nthem at the mercy of the British navy in case they should join their\\r\\nfortunes to those of Austro-Germany. To an impartial observer their\\r\\npolicy of neutrality, if not heroic, was at least wise. The Greek\\r\\nGovernment, therefore, did its best to preserve neutrality. The\\r\\nsurrender of Fort Rupel was not, however, a neutral act and roused in\\r\\nGreece a strong popular protest.\\r\\n\\r\\nVenizelos, who at all times was strongly friendly to the Allies and who\\r\\nwas the one great Greek statesman who not only believed in their\\r\\nultimate victory but who saw that the true interests of Greece were in\\r\\nAnatolia and the Islands of the AEgean, was strongly opposed to King\\r\\nConstantine\\'s action. The Allies showed their resentment by a pacific\\r\\nblockade, to prevent the export of coal to Greece, with the object of\\r\\npreventing supplies from reaching the enemy. This led to a certain\\r\\namount of excitement and the Allied embassies in Athens were insulted by\\r\\nmobs. The governments, therefore, presented an ultimatum commanding the\\r\\ndemobilization of the Greek army, the appointment of a neutral Ministry,\\r\\nand the calling of a new election for the Greek Chamber of Deputies, as\\r\\nwell as the proper punishment of those who were guilty of the disorder.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn substance, the Greeks yielded to the Allied demand, but before a new\\r\\nelection could be held an attack by the Bulgarians on the 17th of August\\r\\nchanged the situation. The Bulgarian armies entered deep in Greek\\r\\nterritory in the eastern provinces and captured the city of Kavalla\\r\\nwithout resistance from the armies of Greece. A portion of the Greek\\r\\narmy at Kavalla surrendered and was taken to Germany as \"guests\" of the\\r\\nGerman Government.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis action of the Greek army led to a Greek revolution which broke out\\r\\nat Saloniki on the 30th of August. The King pursued a tortuous policy,\\r\\nprofessing neutrality and yet constantly bringing himself under\\r\\nsuspicion. The Revolutionists organized an army and finally M.\\r\\nVenizelos, after strong efforts to induce the King to act, became the\\r\\nhead of the Provisional Government of the Revolutionists. The Allies\\r\\npursued a policy almost as tortuous as that of King Constantine. They\\r\\ncould not agree among themselves as to the proper policy, and took no\\r\\ndecided course. King Constantine apparently had the support of Russia\\r\\nand of Italy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime the fighting against Bulgaria was still proceeding. The main\\r\\nforce of the Allies was directed against the city of Monastir, which,\\r\\nafter considerable fighting, was captured on November 19th. This gave\\r\\nthe Serbians possession of an important point in their own country and\\r\\nnaturally proved a great stimulus to the Serbian armies.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom that time on, and during the year 1917, little was done. Minor\\r\\noffensives were undertaken, some of which, like the Allied attack upon\\r\\nDoiran, deserve mention, but on the whole the fighting was a stalemate.\\r\\nMeanwhile the action of the Greek Government had become so\\r\\nunsatisfactory that it was finally determined to demand the abdication\\r\\nof King Constantine, and on June 11th he found himself compelled to\\r\\nyield. In his proclamation he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nObeying necessity of fulfilling my duty toward Greece, I am departing\\r\\nfrom my beloved country accompanied by the heir to the crown, and I\\r\\nleave my son Alexander on the throne. I beg you to accept my decision\\r\\nwith calm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly the next morning the King and his family set sail for Italy on his\\r\\nway to Switzerland, where he became another \"King in exile.\" His son\\r\\nAlexander accepted the throne and issued the following proclamation:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the moment when my august father, making a supreme sacrifice to our\\r\\ndear country, entrusted to me the heavy duties of the Hellenic throne I\\r\\nexpress but one single wish--that God, hearing his prayer, will protect\\r\\nGreece, that He will permit us to see her again united and powerful. In\\r\\nmy grief at being separated in circumstances so critical from my\\r\\nwell-beloved father I have a single consolation: to carry out his sacred\\r\\nmandate which I will endeavor to realize with all my power, following\\r\\nthe lines of his brilliant reign, with the help of the people upon whose\\r\\nlove the Greek dynasty is supported. I am convinced that in obeying the\\r\\nwishes of my father the people by their submission will do their part in\\r\\nenabling us together to rescue our dear country from the terrible\\r\\nsituation in which it finds itself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole country to all appearances received the abdication with\\r\\nsatisfaction. On June 21st, M. Venizelos came to Athens and the Greek\\r\\nChamber, which was illegally dissolved in 1915, was convoked and\\r\\nVenizelos once again became Prime Minister. At last he had succeeded,\\r\\nand he proceeded at once to join the whole of the Grecian forces to the\\r\\ncause of the Allies. Of all the statesmen prominent in the Great War,\\r\\nthere was none more wise, more consistent or more loyal than the great\\r\\nGreek statesman.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor more than a year the Allied armies facing Bulgaria remained upon the\\r\\ndefensive, when, suddenly, on the 16th of September, 1918, in the midst\\r\\nof the wonderful movements that were forcing back the German armies in\\r\\nFrance, a dispatch was received from the Allied forces in Macedonia. The\\r\\nSerbian army, in co-operation with French and English forces, had\\r\\nattacked the Bulgarian positions on a ten-mile front, had stormed those\\r\\npositions and progressed more than five miles. On the next day news was\\r\\nreceived that the advance was continuing; that the Allies had occupied\\r\\nan important series of ridges, and had pierced the Bulgarian front; that\\r\\nmore than three thousand prisoners had been captured and twenty-four\\r\\nguns. The movement took place about twelve miles east of Monastir and\\r\\nthe ridge of Sokol, and the town of Gradeshnitsa were captured by the\\r\\nAllied troops.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt soon became evident that one of the most important movements in the\\r\\nwhole war was being carried on. The Bulgarian armies were crumbling, and\\r\\nthe German troops sent to aid them had been put to flight. The Allied\\r\\ntroops had advanced on an average of ten miles and were continuing to\\r\\nadvance. The Serbs, fighting at last near their own homes, were showing\\r\\ntheir real military strength. Four thousand prisoners had been taken,\\r\\nwith an enormous quantity of war supplies. The Bulgarian positions which\\r\\nhad yielded so easily were positions which they had been fortifying for\\r\\nthree years, and had been previously thought to be impregnable.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 23d it became evident that the retreat of the Bulgarians\\r\\nhad turned into a rout. Notwithstanding reinforcements of Germans and\\r\\nBulgars rushed down in a frantic effort to check them, the Allied armies\\r\\nwere advancing on an eighty-five mile front, crushing all resistance.\\r\\nThe Italian army, on the west, was meeting with equal success, and the\\r\\nnews dispatches reported that the first Bulgarian army in the region of\\r\\nPrilep had been cut off. A dispatch received by the British War Office\\r\\nreported \"As the result of attacks and continual heavy pressure by\\r\\nBritish and Greek troops, in conjunction with the French and Serbian\\r\\nadvance farther west, the enemy has evacuated his whole line from Doiran\\r\\nto the west of the Vardar.\" As it retreated the Bulgarian army was\\r\\nburning supplies and destroying ammunition dumps, burning railway\\r\\nstations and ravaging the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time it was felt throughout the Allied world that the Bulgarian\\r\\ndefeat would have important political consequences. It was remembered\\r\\nthat a short time before King Ferdinand had paid a visit to Germany, and\\r\\nafter long conferences with the German War Lord, had hastily returned to\\r\\nBulgaria. It was recalled that there had been many signs of serious\\r\\ndisorder in Bulgaria, where the Socialist party had been in close touch\\r\\nwith the advance parties in the Ukrainian Republic. It seemed possible\\r\\nthat the Bulgarian defeats had been brought about by Bulgarian\\r\\ndissension and it was also evident that Germany was in no position to\\r\\noffer effective support to its Bulgarian accomplice.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the days passed by the news from this front became more and more\\r\\nfavorable. At all points the Bulgarian armies were retreating in the\\r\\nmost disorderly manner, closely pursued by the Serbians, French,\\r\\nEnglish, Italians, and Greeks. Bulgarian troops were deserting in\\r\\nthousands, and thousands of others were surrendering without resistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 26th it was announced that the Bulgar front had\\r\\ndisappeared; that the armies had been cut into a number of groups and\\r\\nwere fleeing before the Allied troops. Town after town was being\\r\\ncaptured, with enormous quantities of stores. On Friday, September 27th,\\r\\nit was announced that Bulgaria had asked the Allies for an armistice of\\r\\nforty-eight hours, with a view to making peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe situation was now causing intense excitement. The Germans tried to\\r\\nminimize the Bulgarian surrender. A dispatch from Berlin declared that\\r\\nPremier Malinoff\\'s offer of an armistice was made without the support of\\r\\nother members of the Cabinet or of King Ferdinand, and that Germany\\r\\nwould make a solemn protest against it. German newspapers were demanding\\r\\nthat Malinoff be dismissed immediately and court-martialed for high\\r\\ntreason. The Berlin message asserted that the Premier\\'s offer had\\r\\ncreated great dissatisfaction in Bulgaria and that strong military\\r\\nmeasures had been taken to support the Bulgarian front. According to\\r\\nstatements from Sofia it was added a counter-movement against the action\\r\\nof the Premier had already been set on foot. It was declared in Germany\\r\\nthat the Premier\\'s act was the result of Germany\\'s refusal to send\\r\\nsufficient reinforcements to Bulgaria. Secretary Lansing made the\\r\\nannouncement that the United States Government had received a proposal\\r\\nfor an armistice.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt appeared that Bulgaria had been maneuvering toward peace for some\\r\\ntime. The Bulgarians had foreseen their inability to meet the expected\\r\\nAllied attack, and had made every effort to obtain German\\r\\nreinforcements. Moreover, they were highly dissatisfied with the\\r\\ntreatment they had received from Germany in connection with Bulgaria\\'s\\r\\ndispute with Turkey as to territorial dispositions to be made after the\\r\\nwar. Probably the most important reason, however, for the Bulgarian\\r\\noverthrow was that by this time they were sick of the war. They had not,\\r\\nin the first place, gone into it with any enthusiasm, and though they\\r\\ncould fight bravely enough against their Serbian foe, no true Bulgarian\\r\\ncould ever feel himself in a natural position facing his old-time\\r\\nRussian friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nBulgaria had come to the end. Malinoff, the Premier, had from the\\r\\nbeginning been opposed to the war. Mobs in Sofia were demanding\\r\\nsurrender. Ferdinand was compelled to give way to the wishes of his\\r\\nCabinet and his people, and in spite of the fact that he had promised\\r\\nthe Kaiser to remain faithful to the Alliance, he gave his consent to\\r\\nthe movement for unconditional surrender.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn official Bulgarian statement read as follows: \"In view of the\\r\\nconjunction of circumstances which have recently arisen, and after the\\r\\nposition had been jointly discussed with all competent authorities, the\\r\\nBulgarian Government, desiring to put an end to the bloodshed, has\\r\\nauthorized the Commander-in-Chief of the army to propose to the\\r\\nGeneralissimo of the armies of the Entente at Saloniki, a cessation of\\r\\nhostilities, and the entering into of negotiations for obtaining an\\r\\narmistice and peace. The members of the Bulgarian delegation left\\r\\nyesterday evening in order to get into touch with the Plenipotentiaries\\r\\nof the Entente belligerents.\" This statement was dated September 24th.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Bulgarian officers entrusted with the proposal for an armistice\\r\\npresented themselves at Saloniki, General d\\'Esperey gave the following\\r\\nreply: \"My response cannot be, by reason of the military situation,\\r\\nother than the following. I can accord neither an armistice nor a\\r\\nsuspension of hostilities tending to interrupt the operations in course.\\r\\nOn the other hand, I will receive with all due courtesy the delegates\\r\\nduly qualified of the Royal Bulgarian Government.\" The Bulgarian\\r\\ndelegates were General Lonkhoff, commander of the Bulgarian Second Army,\\r\\nM. Liapcheff, Finance Minister, and M. Radeff, a former member of the\\r\\nBulgarian Cabinet.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the evening of the 29th an armistice was signed. The terms of the\\r\\nsurrender were approved by the Entente governments, and hostilities\\r\\nceased at noon September 30th. The terms of the armistice were as\\r\\nfollows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBulgaria agrees to evacuate all the territory she now occupies in Greece\\r\\nand Serbia; to demobilize her army immediately and surrender all means\\r\\nof transport to the Allies. Bulgaria also will surrender her boats and\\r\\ncontrol of navigation on the Danube, and concede to the Allies free\\r\\npassage through Bulgaria for the development of military operations. All\\r\\nBulgarian arms and ammunition are to be stored under the control of the\\r\\nAllies, to whom is conceded the right to occupy all important strategic\\r\\npoints. The military occupation of Bulgaria will be entrusted to\\r\\nBritish, French and Italian forces, and the evacuated portions of Greece\\r\\nand Serbia, respectively, to Greek and Serbian troops.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis armistice meant a complete military surrender, and Bulgaria ceased\\r\\nto be a belligerent. All questions of territorial rearrangement in the\\r\\nBalkans were purposely omitted from the Convention. The Allies made no\\r\\nstipulation concerning King Ferdinand, his position being considered an\\r\\ninternal matter, one for the Bulgarians themselves to deal with. The\\r\\narmistice was to remain in operation until the final general peace was\\r\\nconcluded.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe request of Bulgaria for an armistice and peace, stunned Germany,\\r\\nwhich at that time was living in an atmosphere of political crisis and\\r\\nmilitary misfortune. The German papers laid much of the blame on the\\r\\ndesperate economic conditions in Bulgaria, which had been made worse by\\r\\npolitical strife.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Bulgarian collapse the Serbians, with the other Allied troops\\r\\nwho had just captured Uskub, swept northward to drive the remaining\\r\\nGermans and Austrians out of Serbia and beyond the Danube. On October\\r\\n13th they captured Nish, thus cutting the famous Orient railroad from\\r\\nBerlin to Constantinople. German authorities announced that henceforth\\r\\ntrains on this line would run only to the Serbian border.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 4th King Ferdinand abdicated his throne in favor of his son\\r\\nCrown Prince Boris, and left Sofia the same night for Vienna. Before\\r\\nleaving he issued the following manifesto renouncing the Bulgarian\\r\\ncrown:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy reason of the succession of events which have occurred in my kingdom,\\r\\nand which demand a sacrifice from each citizen, even to the surrendering\\r\\nof oneself for the well being of all, I desire to give as the first\\r\\nexample the sacrifice of myself. Despite the sacred ties, which for\\r\\nthirty-two years have bound me so firmly to this country, for whose\\r\\nprosperity and greatness I have given all my powers, I have decided to\\r\\nrenounce the royal Bulgarian crown in favor of my eldest son, His\\r\\nHighness the Prince Royal Boris of Tirnovo. I call upon all faithful\\r\\nsubjects and true patriots to unite as one man about the throne of King\\r\\nBoris, to lift the country from its difficult situation, and to elevate\\r\\nnew Bulgaria to the height to which it is predestined.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore signing his declaration of abdication he had consulted with the\\r\\nparty leaders and received their approval. King Ferdinand had lost his\\r\\npopularity ever since it became apparent that he had made a mistake in\\r\\nsiding with the Teutonic Powers. He was undoubtedly in fear that a\\r\\nrevolution might upset the whole dynasty. Premier Malinoff announced the\\r\\nabdication to the Bulgarian Parliament, and the accession of Prince\\r\\nBoris to the throne was received with much enthusiasm. The church bells\\r\\nwere rung, and great crowds gathered in the streets.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeaking from the steps of the Palace the new King said; \"I thank you\\r\\nfor your manifestation of patriotic sentiments. I have faith in the good\\r\\nstar of Bulgaria, and I believe that the Bulgar people, by their good\\r\\nqualities and co-operation, are directed to a brilliant future.\" King\\r\\nFerdinand, it was given out, had renounced politics and was intending in\\r\\nthe future to devote himself to his favorite pursuits, chiefly to\\r\\nbotany.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surrender of Bulgaria was at once recognized as the overthrow of\\r\\nGermany\\'s \"Mittel-Europa\" threat, which had apparently been carried into\\r\\neffect when Turkey and Bulgaria joined the Central Powers. It had for a\\r\\nlong time been one of Germany\\'s most coveted aims. After the\\r\\nFranco-Prussian war the German people had grown enormously in wealth and\\r\\nin numbers. It had become one of the greatest manufacturing powers in\\r\\nthe world. Its ships were transporting its commerce on every sea, but it\\r\\nwas not satisfied. The German leaders, most of whom were young men at\\r\\nthe time of the war with France, and had been deeply impressed by a\\r\\nsense of the German power, were full of the idea that Germany was the\\r\\ngreatest of nations, and that she should impress her will on all the\\r\\nworld.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey might have done this peacefully, for the seas were free, but German\\r\\nself-esteem was not satisfied with peaceful progress. They felt that it\\r\\nwas necessary to reach out in the world for colonies. They seized a\\r\\nprovince in China. They meddled with affairs in Morocco. They annexed\\r\\ncolonies in Africa, but none of these projects were wholly satisfactory.\\r\\nThey provided no great outlet for the products of their workshops, nor\\r\\nfor their overflow population, which largely went to North and South\\r\\nAmerica and became citizens of these foreign nations.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir eyes finally turned to the great East. There in China and India\\r\\nand the neighboring countries were three hundred millions of men whose\\r\\ntrade would be a worthy prize for even Germany\\'s ambition. Then began\\r\\nthe development of what is sometimes called Germany\\'s Mittel-Europa\\r\\ndream. Her scholars encouraged it; her travelers brought reports which\\r\\nstimulated the interest, and soon she began practically to carry it into\\r\\neffect. It meant the building of a great railroad down to the Persian\\r\\nGulf; a railroad to be controlled by nations where her influence would\\r\\nbe all-powerful. She needed Austria, she needed Serbia, she needed\\r\\nBulgaria and Turkey.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map: Most of Asia, Africa and Australia, showing\\r\\nGermany\\'s hoped for rail and ship routes from the North Sea to Australia,\\r\\nSouth Africa and China.]\\r\\n  HOW THE PAN-GERMANS PLANNED TO EXTEND THEIR \"MITTEL-EUROPA\" DREAM\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first the project was carried out peacefully. Friendly relations were\\r\\nstimulated with Turkey and the other necessary powers; permits were\\r\\nobtained to build the railroad. But Germany was not the only power that\\r\\nhad dreamed this dream. Alexander the Great had done it. Napoleon had\\r\\ndone it, and England had carried it out. From the days of Queen\\r\\nElizabeth the English control of India was one of its greatest assets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough most of the nineteenth century the English power in the East was\\r\\nthreatened, not by Germany, but by Russia. It was because of this threat\\r\\nthat England had always protected Turkey. Turkey and Constantinople were\\r\\nher barrier against Russia. The literature of England in the last days\\r\\nof the nineteenth century shows clearly her fear of Russian intrigues in\\r\\nIndia. Kipling\\'s Indian stories are full of it. But now that fear had\\r\\npassed. It was no longer the imaginary danger which might come from the\\r\\ngreat Slavic Empire, but a trade weapon in the grasp of the most\\r\\nefficient military power ever developed that was threatening. Against\\r\\nthis threat England had been doing her best. Here and there near the\\r\\nPersian Gulf she had been extending her influence. Here and there, as\\r\\nGerman Consuls obtained concessions, they would find them later\\r\\nwithdrawn, because England had stepped in. Yet just before the war\\r\\nEngland, anxious for peace, had come to an agreement with Germany\\r\\npractically admitting the German plans to be carried out as far as\\r\\nBagdad.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt looked as though it were only a question of time, but when the Balkan\\r\\nwars established Serbia as the greatest of the Balkan powers, and gave\\r\\nRussia a preponderating influence among the Balkan nations, and when it\\r\\nbegan to look as if some great Balkan state might be established which\\r\\nshould be friendly to Russia and consequently a hindrance to the German\\r\\nscheme, then it was that it was necessary that war should come. The\\r\\nGermans had been wonderfully successful. For a time they controlled\\r\\nAustria, Bulgaria, Serbia and Turkey, but with Bulgaria\\'s fall the end\\r\\nhad come. They were compelled to awake from their Mittel-Europa dream.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph]\\r\\n  Copyright Press Illustrating Service\\r\\n  BULGARIANS CELEBRATE PEACE\\r\\n  The first peace picture.

It was\\r\\nvery plain to the German High Command, as well as to the Allied leaders,\\r\\nthat Germany\\'s great ambitions had now been definitely thwarted. It\\r\\nseems clear that, in spite of the hopeful and encouraging words which\\r\\nthey addressed to their own armies, the expert soldiers, who were\\r\\ncontrolling the destinies of Germany, understood well the conditions\\r\\nthey were facing. Putting aside all sentiment, therefore, they\\r\\ndeliberately set out to obtain a peace which would leave them an\\r\\nopportunity to gain by diplomacy what they were sure that they were\\r\\nabout to lose on the field of battle. They had made pleas for peace\\r\\nbefore, but their pleas had been rejected.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Allied leaders were fighting for a principle. They could not be\\r\\nsatisfied with a draw. They could not be satisfied if Germany were left\\r\\nin a position which would enable her after a rest of a few years to\\r\\nrenew her effort to impose her will upon the world. It was unanimously\\r\\nrecognized that the war must be carried on to the very end. The Allies\\r\\ntook this position when the fortunes of war seemed to have gone against\\r\\nthem, when Russia was defeated, Roumania and Serbia crushed, and the\\r\\nGerman lines in France were approaching the capital. It was unlikely\\r\\nthat now, when Germany was suffering defeat and every day was yielding\\r\\nthe Allied armies encouraging gains, there should be any change in the\\r\\nstrong determination of the Allied leaders. Nevertheless, it was\\r\\nnecessary to make the attempt.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 15th, the Austro-Hungarian Government addressed a\\r\\ncommunication to the Allied Powers and to the Holy See suggesting a\\r\\nmeeting for a confidential and non-binding discussion of war aims, with\\r\\na view to the possible calling of a peace conference.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe official communication from the Austro-Hungarian Government was\\r\\nhanded to Secretary of State Lansing in Washington at 6.20 o\\'clock on\\r\\nSeptember 16th.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 6.45 the following abbreviated reply of the United States Government\\r\\nwas made public, by the Secretary of State:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI am authorized by the President to state that the following will be the\\r\\nreply of this government to the Austro-Hungarian note proposing an\\r\\nunofficial conference of belligerents. \"The Government of the United\\r\\nStates feels that there is only one reply which it can make to the\\r\\nsuggestion of the Austro-Hungarian Government. It has repeatedly and\\r\\nwith entire candor stated the terms upon which the United States would\\r\\nconsider peace, and can and will entertain no proposal for a conference\\r\\nupon the matter concerning which it has made its position and purpose so\\r\\nplain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nArthur J. Balfour, the British Foreign Secretary, in a statement made\\r\\nSeptember 16th said: \"It is incredible that anything can come of this\\r\\nproposal.... This cynical proposal of the Austrian Government is not a\\r\\ngenuine attempt to obtain peace. It is an attempt to divide the Allies.\"\\r\\nPremier Clemenceau in France took similar grounds, and stated in the\\r\\nFrench Senate: \"We will fight until the hour when the enemy comes to\\r\\nunderstand that bargaining between crime and right is no longer\\r\\npossible. We want a just and a strong peace, protecting the future\\r\\nagainst the abominations of the past.\" Italy joined with her Allies and\\r\\ndeclared that a negotiated peace was impossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe refusal on the part of the Allies to respond to the Austrian peace\\r\\nproposal evidently greatly disturbed the German leaders. The continued\\r\\nGerman reverses, and the surrender of Bulgaria had taken away all hope.\\r\\nThey were anxious to conclude some kind of peace before meeting\\r\\nirretrievable disaster. They therefore determined to appoint as\\r\\nChancellor of the Empire some statesman who might be represented as a\\r\\nsupporter of an honest peace, and Count von Hertling, whose previous\\r\\nutterances might put under suspicion any peace move coming from him, was\\r\\nremoved and Prince Maximilian of Baden appointed as his successor on\\r\\nSeptember 30th.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrince Maximilian was put forward as a Moderate, in accordance with the\\r\\nevident purpose of the government to continue peace proposals. He was\\r\\nthe heir apparent to the Grand Ducal throne of Baden, and was the first\\r\\nman in public life in Germany to declare that the Empire could not\\r\\nconquer by the sword alone. He did this in an address to the Upper\\r\\nChamber in Baden, of which he was President, on December 15, 1917.\\r\\n\"Power alone can never secure our position,\" he said, \"and our sword\\r\\nalone will never be able to tear down the opposition to us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time he made an attack upon the ideals set up by President\\r\\nWilson. \"President Wilson,\" he continued, \"after three years of war\\r\\ngathers together all the outworn slogans of the Entente of 1914, and\\r\\ndenounces Germany as the disturber of the peace, proclaiming a crusade\\r\\nfor humanity, liberty and the rights of small nations.\" Then, forgetting\\r\\nthat the United States had entered the war nearly a month after the\\r\\nabdication of the Czar of Russia, he added: \"President Wilson has no\\r\\nright to speak in the name of democracy and liberty, for he was the\\r\\nmighty war ally of Russian Czardom, but he had deaf ears when the\\r\\nRussian democracy appealed to him to allow it to discuss peace\\r\\nconditions.\" The Baden address created a great sensation all over\\r\\nGermany, which was increased when, in an interview in January, he\\r\\ndeclared that all ideas of conquest must be abandoned, and that Germany\\r\\nmust serve as a bulwark to prevent the spread of Bolshevism among the\\r\\nwestern nations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere can be no doubt that the appointment of Prince Maximilian was a\\r\\ndefinite attempt to seek peace. It was thought that he would be\\r\\nrecognized by the Allied leaders as an honest friend of peace, and that\\r\\nany effort he would make would be treated with respect. He was, however,\\r\\na vigorous supporter of the Kaiser and of German autocracy, and while\\r\\nhis appointment might mean that Germany was desirous of peace it did not\\r\\nmean that she had changed her ways. Three days before the appointment of\\r\\nPrince Maximilian, President Wilson, in an address delivered in the\\r\\nMetropolitan Opera House in New York, had restated the issues of the\\r\\nwar, declaring (1) for impartial justice, (2) settlement to be made in\\r\\nthe common interests of all, (3) no leagues within the common family of\\r\\nthe league of nations, (4) no selfish economic combination within that\\r\\nleague, and (5) all international agreements and treaties of every kind\\r\\nmust be made known in their entirety to the rest of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrince Maximilian, coming into power undoubtedly for the purpose of\\r\\narranging a peace, proceeded at once to make a new peace offer. He based\\r\\nhis action on President Wilson\\'s speech and on October 4th sent to\\r\\nPresident Wilson, through the Swiss Government, the following note:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German Government requests the President of the United States to\\r\\ntake in hand the restoration of peace, acquaint all the belligerent\\r\\nstates with this request, and invite them to send plenipotentiaries for\\r\\nthe purpose of opening negotiations. It accepts the program set forth by\\r\\nthe President of the United States in his message to Congress on January\\r\\n8th, and in his later pronouncements, especially his speech of September\\r\\n27th, as a basis for peace negotiations. With a view to avoiding further\\r\\nbloodshed the German Government requests the immediate conclusion of an\\r\\narmistice on land and on water and in the air.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHe followed this note on October 5th with an address before the German\\r\\nReichstag, of which the following are the most important points:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn accordance with the Imperial decree of September 30th, the German\\r\\nEmpire has undergone a basic alteration of its politic leadership. As\\r\\nsuccessor to Count George F. von Hertling, whose services in behalf of\\r\\nthe Fatherland deserve the highest acknowledgment, I have been summoned\\r\\nby the Emperor to lead the new government. In accordance with the\\r\\ngovernmental method now introduced I submit to the Reichstag, publicly\\r\\nand without delay, the principles by which I propose to conduct the\\r\\ngrave responsibilities of the office. These principles were firmly\\r\\nestablished by the agreement of the federated governments and the\\r\\nleaders of the majority parties in this honorable House before I decided\\r\\nto assume the duties of Chancellor. They contain therefore not only my\\r\\nown confession of political faith, but that of an overwhelming portion\\r\\nof the German people\\'s representatives--that is, of the German\\r\\nnation--which has constituted the Reichstag on the basis of a general,\\r\\nequal, and secret franchise and according to their will.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly the fact that I know the conviction and will of the majority of the\\r\\npeople are back of me, has given me strength to take upon myself conduct\\r\\nof the Empire\\'s affairs in this hard and earnest time in which we are\\r\\nliving. One man\\'s shoulders would be too weak to carry alone the\\r\\ntremendous responsibility which falls upon the government at present.\\r\\nOnly if the people take active part in the broader sense of the word in\\r\\ndeciding their destinies, in other words, if responsibility also extends\\r\\nto the majority of their freely elected political leaders, can the\\r\\nleading statesman confidently assume his part of the responsibility in\\r\\nthe service of folk and Fatherland.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy resolve to this has been especially lightened for me by the fact that\\r\\nprominent leaders of the laboring class have found a way in the new\\r\\ngovernment to the highest offices of the Empire. I see therein a sure\\r\\nguarantee that the new government will be supported by the confidence of\\r\\nthe broad masses of the people, without whose true support the whole\\r\\nundertaking would be compelled to failure in advance. Hence what I say\\r\\ntoday is not only in my own name, and those of my official helpers, but\\r\\nin the name of the German people.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe program of the majority parties, upon which I take my stand,\\r\\ncontains first, an acceptance of the answer of the former Imperial\\r\\nGovernment to Pope Benedict\\'s note of August 1, 1916, and an\\r\\nunconditional acceptance of the Reichstag resolution of July 19th, the\\r\\nsame year. It further declares willingness to join the general league of\\r\\nnations based on the foundation of equal rights for all, both strong and\\r\\nweak. It considers the solution of the Belgian question to lie in the\\r\\ncomplete rehabilitation of Belgium, particularly of its independence and\\r\\nterritorial integrity. An effort shall also be made to reach an\\r\\nunderstanding on the question of indemnity. The program will not permit\\r\\nthe peace treaties hitherto concluded to be a hindrance to the\\r\\nconclusion of the general peace. Its particular aim is that popular\\r\\nrepresentative bodies shall be formed immediately on a broad basis in\\r\\nthe Baltic provinces, in Lithuania and Poland. We will promote the\\r\\nrealization of necessary preliminary conditions therefore without delay\\r\\nby the introduction of civilian rule. All these lands shall regulate\\r\\ntheir constitutions and their relations with neighboring peoples without\\r\\nexternal interference.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went on to point out the progressive political developments in\\r\\nPrussia and declared that the \"message of the King of Prussia promising\\r\\nthe democratic franchise must be fulfilled quickly and completely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Wilson did not find Prince Maximilian\\'s proposal wholly\\r\\nsatisfactory, and on October 8th, he inquired of the Imperial Chancellor\\r\\nwhether the meaning of the proposal was that the German Government\\r\\naccepted the terms laid down in his address to the Congress of the\\r\\nUnited States and in subsequent addresses; and whether its object in\\r\\nentering into discussions would be only to agree upon the practical\\r\\ndetails of their application. He also suggested that so long as the\\r\\narmies of the Central Powers were upon the soil of the governments with\\r\\nwhich the United States was associated, he would not feel at liberty to\\r\\npropose a cessation of arms to those governments. He also inquired\\r\\nwhether the Imperial Chancellor was speaking merely for the constituted\\r\\nauthorities of the Empire, who had so far conducted the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Wilson\\'s reply aroused much difference of opinion among the\\r\\nAllies, but on the whole was regarded as a clever diplomatic move.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German Government responded to these questions of the President on\\r\\nOctober 12th, by a message signed by Dr. W. S. Solf, who had just been\\r\\nappointed Imperial Foreign Secretary. In this reply the German\\r\\nGovernment declared that it did accept President Wilson\\'s terms; that it\\r\\nwas ready to comply with the suggestion of the President and withdraw\\r\\nits troops from Allied territory, and that the German Government was\\r\\nrepresenting in all its actions the will of the great majority of the\\r\\nGerman people.\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany had, indeed, made enormous concessions, and the German people\\r\\nappeared to have taken for granted that such an offer would be accepted.\\r\\nAn Amsterdam despatch declared: \"People in Berlin are kissing one\\r\\nanother in the street, though they are perfect strangers and shouting\\r\\npeace congratulations to each other. The only words heard anywhere in\\r\\nGermany are \\'Peace at last\\'.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President however, had been struck by the news coming in from day to\\r\\nday of new atrocities in France, and of new cases of submarine murders,\\r\\nand in his reply of October 14th, he declared that while he was ready to\\r\\nrefer the question of an armistice to the judgment and advice of\\r\\nmilitary advisers of the government of the United States and the Allied\\r\\ngovernments, he felt sure that none of those governments would consent\\r\\nto consider an armistice as long as the armed forces of Germany\\r\\ncontinued the illegal and inhuman practices which they were persisting\\r\\nin. He also emphasized the fact that no armistice would be accepted that\\r\\nwould not provide absolutely satisfactory safeguards and guarantees of\\r\\nthe maintenance of the military supremacy of the armies of the United\\r\\nStates and of the Allies in the field. The President also called the\\r\\nattention of the Government of Germany to that clause of his address on\\r\\nthe Fourth of July in which he had demanded \"the destruction of every\\r\\narbitrary power that can separately, secretly and of its single choice\\r\\ndisturb the peace of the world, or, if it cannot be presently destroyed,\\r\\nat least its reduction to virtual impotency.\" He declared that the power\\r\\nwhich had hitherto controlled the German nation was of the sort thus\\r\\ndescribed, and that its alteration actually constituted a condition\\r\\nprecedent to peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis answer of the President was greeted with approval in the United\\r\\nStates and everywhere in the Allied countries. It meant that the\\r\\nImperial Power of Germany was not to be allowed to hide itself behind a\\r\\nso-called reorganization done under its own direction. As one of the\\r\\nSenators of the United States expressed it: \"It is an unequivocal demand\\r\\nthat the Hohenzollerns shall get out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring these negotiations the Allied armies under Marshal Foch had been\\r\\ndriving the enemy before them. When Baron Burian was making his peace\\r\\noffer on behalf of Austria-Hungary the Americans were engaged in\\r\\npinching off the St. Mihiel salient, and about that date the British\\r\\nwere launching their great attack on the St. Quentin defenses. The\\r\\nreports of the great Allied drive indicated a constant succession of\\r\\nAllied victories.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 19th, the British advanced into the Hindenburg line,\\r\\nnorthwest of St. Quentin, and on September 20th, while the American guns\\r\\nwere shelling Metz, the British were advancing steadily near Cambrai and\\r\\nLa Bassee.\\r\\n\\r\\nDay by day the advance proceeded. On September 26th, the first American\\r\\narmy smashed through the Hindenburg line for an average gain of seven\\r\\nmiles, between the Meuse and the Aisne rivers on a twenty-mile front. On\\r\\nSeptember 27th, the French gained five miles in an advance east of\\r\\nRheims, and the British were attacking in the Cambrai sector on a\\r\\nfourteen-mile front, crossing the Canal du Nord and piercing the\\r\\nHindenburg line at several points. On September 28th, the Americans\\r\\nreached the Kriemhilde line, while the British were close in on Cambrai.\\r\\nOn September 30th, the British took Messines Ridge, while the French\\r\\nwere still advancing between the Aisne and Vesle Rivers. On October 1st,\\r\\nthe French troops entered St. Quentin and the British took the northern\\r\\nand western suburbs of Cambrai. During the next week an enveloping\\r\\nmovement was instituted north and south of Lille. On October 5th, the\\r\\nGermans evacuated Lille, on October 9th the British took Cambrai.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn these drives the American colored troops played a conspicuous part.\\r\\nThe entire Three hundred and sixty-fifth regiment, composed wholly of\\r\\ncolored troops, was later awarded the coveted Croix de Guerre, or War\\r\\nCross, by the French Government. It was a well-deserved honor, for the\\r\\nboys of the Three hundred and sixty-fifth bore themselves with great\\r\\ngallantry in the September and October offensive in the Champagne sector\\r\\nand suffered heavy losses. In conferring the Croix de Guerre, the\\r\\ncitation dealt in considerable detail with the valor of particular\\r\\nofficers and praised the courage and tenacity of the whole regiment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Germans were retreating in Belgium day by day, under the attacks of\\r\\nthe Belgian and French armies. On October 11th the Germans evacuated the\\r\\nChemin des Dames. On October 16th the Germans began the evacuation of\\r\\nthe Belgian coast region and each day increased the number of Belgian\\r\\ntowns once more in Allied control.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLVIII\\r\\n\\r\\nBATTLES IN THE AIR\\r\\n\\r\\nHe who conquers the fear of death is master of his fate. Upon this\\r\\nphilosophy fifty thousand young men of the warring nations went forth to\\r\\ndo battle among the clouds. The story of these battles is the real\\r\\nromance of the World War. In 1914 no one had ever known and history had\\r\\nnever recorded a struggle to the death in the air. When the war ended a\\r\\nnew literature of adventure had been created, a literature emblazoned\\r\\nwith superb heroisms, with God-like daring, and with such utter disdain\\r\\nof death that they were raised out of the olden ranks of mere\\r\\nearth-crawling mankind and became supermen of the air.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of these heroic names became household words during the war. These\\r\\nwere the aces of the French, American and German air-forces. The British\\r\\nadopted a policy in news concerning their airmen similar to that\\r\\ngoverning their publication of submarine sinkings. They argued that the\\r\\nnaming of British, Canadian and Australian aces would direct the attacks\\r\\nof German aviators against the most useful men in the British forces.\\r\\nThey also felt that publicity would tend toward the swagger which in\\r\\nEnglish slang was \"swank\" and toward a deterioration in discipline.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaoul Lufberry, Quentin Roosevelt, son of ex-President Roosevelt, and\\r\\nEdward Rickenbacher were names that figured extensively in news of the\\r\\nAmerican air forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nLufberry and Roosevelt were killed in action. Rickenbacher, after dozens\\r\\nof hair-raising escapes from death, came through the war without\\r\\ninjury. The pioneer of American aviators in the war was William Thaw of\\r\\nYale, who formed the original Lafayette Escadrille.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides these men, America produced a number of other brilliant aces, an\\r\\nace being one who brought down five enemy planes, each victory being\\r\\nattested by at least three witnesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French had as their outstanding aces Georges Guynemer and Rene\\r\\nFonck. Guynemer went into the flying game as a mechanician. He became\\r\\nthe most formidable human fighting machine on the western front before\\r\\nhe was sent to death in a blazing airplane.\\r\\n\\r\\nLieut. Rene Fonck ended the war with a total of seventy-five official\\r\\naerial victories. He had an additional forty Huns to his credit but not\\r\\nofficially confirmed. His greatest day was when he brought down six\\r\\nplanes. His quickest work was the shooting down of three Germans in\\r\\ntwenty seconds.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe fought three distinct battles in the air when, on May 8, 1918, he\\r\\nbrought down six German airplanes in one day. All three engagements were\\r\\nfought within two hours. In all, Fonck fired only fifty-six shots, an\\r\\naverage of little more than nine bullets for each enemy brought down--an\\r\\nextraordinary record, in view of the fact that aviators often fired\\r\\nhundreds of rounds without crippling their opponent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first fight, in which Lieutenant Fonck brought down three German\\r\\nmachines, lasted only a minute and a half, and the young Frenchman fired\\r\\nonly twenty-two shots. Fonck was leading two other companions on a\\r\\npatrol in the Moreuil-Montdidier sector on May 8th, when the French\\r\\nsquadron met three German two-seater airplanes coming toward them in\\r\\narrow formation. Signaling to his companions, Lieutenant Fonck dived at\\r\\nthe leading German plane and, with a few shots sent it down in flames.\\r\\nFonck turned to the left, and the second enemy flier followed in an\\r\\neffort to attack him from behind, but the Frenchman made a quick turn\\r\\nabove him and, with five shots, sent the second German to death. Ten\\r\\nseconds had barely elapsed between the two victories.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third enemy pilot headed for home, but when Lieutenant Fonck\\r\\napparently gave up the chase and turned back toward the French lines the\\r\\nGerman went after him, and was flying parallel and a little below, when\\r\\nFonck made a quick turn, drove straight at him and sent him down within\\r\\nhalf a mile of the spot where his two comrades hit the earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German heroes were the celebrated Captain Boelke, and the no less\\r\\nfamous inventor of the \"flying circus,\" Count von Richthofen. Captain\\r\\nBoelke caused a great many Allied \"crashes\" by hiding in clouds and\\r\\ndiving straight at planes flying beneath him. As he came within range,\\r\\nhe opened up with a stream of machine-gun bullets. If he failed to get\\r\\nhis prey, his rush carried him past his opponent into safety. He rarely\\r\\nre-attacked. Count von Richthofen was responsible for many airplane\\r\\nsquadron tactics that later were used on both sides. The planes under\\r\\nhis command were gaily painted for easy identification during the thick\\r\\nof a fight. Their usual method was to cut off single planes or small\\r\\ngroups of Allied planes, and to circle around them in the method\\r\\nemployed by Admiral Dewey for the reduction of the Spanish forts and\\r\\nships in the Battle of Manila Bay.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dangers of aerial warfare were instrumental in producing high\\r\\nchivalry in all the encampments of air men. Graves of fallen aviators\\r\\nwere marked and decorated by their former foes, and captured aviators\\r\\nreceived exceptionally good treatment, where foemen aviators could\\r\\nprocure such treatment for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil the advent of America into the war, neither side had a marked\\r\\nadvantage in aircraft. At first Germany had a slight advantage; then the\\r\\nbalance swung to the Allied side; but at no time was the scale tipped\\r\\nvery much. American quantity production of airplanes, however, gave to\\r\\nthe Entente Allies an overwhelming advantage. Final standardization of\\r\\ntools and design for the \"Soul of the American Airplane\" was not\\r\\naccomplished until February, 1918. Yet within eight months more than\\r\\n15,000 Liberty engines, each of them fully tested and of the highest\\r\\nquality, were delivered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States did not follow European types of engines, but in a\\r\\nwonderfully short time developed an engine standardized in the most\\r\\nrecent efficiency of American industries.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Secretary of War Baker, an inspiring feature of this work\\r\\nwas the aid rendered by consulting engineers and motor manufacturers,\\r\\nwho gave up their trade secrets under the emergency of war needs.\\r\\nRealizing that the new design would be a government design and no firm\\r\\nor individual would reap selfish benefit because of its making, the\\r\\nmotor manufacturers, nevertheless, patriotically revealed their trade\\r\\nsecrets and made available trade processes of great commercial value.\\r\\nThese industries also contributed the services of approximately two\\r\\nhundred of their best draftsmen. Parts of the first engine were turned\\r\\nout at twelve different factories, located all the way from Connecticut\\r\\nto California. When the parts were assembled the adjustment was perfect\\r\\nand the performance of the engine was wonderfully gratifying.\\r\\n\\r\\nThirty days after the assembling of the first engine preliminary tests\\r\\njustified the government in formally accepting the engine as the best\\r\\naircraft engine produced in any country. The final tests confirmed the\\r\\nfaith in the new motor.\\r\\n\\r\\nBritish and French machines as a rule were not adapted to American\\r\\nmanufacturing methods. They were highly specialized machines, requiring\\r\\nmuch hand work from mechanics, who were, in fact, artisans.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe standardized United States aviation engine, produced under\\r\\ngovernment supervision, said Secretary of War Baker, was expected \"to\\r\\nsolve the problem of building first-class, powerful and yet\\r\\ncomparatively delicate aviation engines by American machine methods--the\\r\\nsame standardized methods which revolutionized the automobile industry\\r\\nin this country.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manufacture of De Haviland airplanes equipped with Liberty motors\\r\\nwas a factor in the war. One of these De Havilands without tuning up,\\r\\nmade a non-stop trip on November 11, 1918, from Dayton, Ohio, to\\r\\nWashington, D. C., a distance of 430 miles, in three hours and fifty\\r\\nminutes. Great battle squadrons of these De Haviland planes equipped\\r\\nwith Liberty motors made bombing raids over the German lines in the\\r\\nVerdun sector. Others operated as scouting and reconnaissance planes and\\r\\nas spotters for American artillery.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the period from September 12th to 11 o\\'clock on the morning on\\r\\nNovember 11th, the American aviators brought down 473 German machines.\\r\\nOf this number, 353 were confirmed officially. Day bombing groups, from\\r\\nthe time they began operations, dropped a total of 116,818 kilograms of\\r\\nbombs within the German lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nBombing operations were begun in August by the 96th Squadron, which in\\r\\nfive flying days dropped 18,080 kilograms of bombs. The first day\\r\\nbombardment group began work in September, the group including the 96th,\\r\\nthe 20th and 11th Squadrons. The 166th Squadron joined the group in\\r\\nNovember.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn twelve flying days in September the bombers dropped 3,466 kilograms\\r\\nof bombs; in fifteen flying days in October, 46,133 kilograms, and in\\r\\nfour flying days in November, 17,979 kilograms.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 11th, the day of the signing of the armistice, there were\\r\\nactually engaged on the front 740 American planes, 744 pilots, 457\\r\\nobservers and 23 aerial gunners.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the total number of planes, 329 were of the pursuit type, 296 were\\r\\nfor observation and 115 were bombers. In addition, several hundred\\r\\nplanes of various types were being used at the instruction camps when\\r\\nthe war ended.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerica, although the last of the great nations to embark upon a great\\r\\naircraft production program, was the birthplace of the airplane, the\\r\\nWright Brothers being the undisputed inventors of the modern type.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilbur and Orville Wright made their first experiments in flying at\\r\\nKittyhawk, N. C. Their first attempts were of a gliding nature and were\\r\\naccomplished by starting from the top of a dune or sand hill, the\\r\\noperator lying full length, face downward, on the under plane of the\\r\\nmachine. During these experiments they succeeded in flying six hundred\\r\\nfeet.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir first flight with an airplane driven by a motor was on December\\r\\n17, 1903, when they succeeded in flying about two hundred and seventy\\r\\nyards in fifty-nine seconds. This machine was driven by a\\r\\nsixteen-horse-power motor.\\r\\n\\r\\nSantos Dumont was one of the early pioneers in aeronautical experiments.\\r\\nAfter showing a marked talent with balloons, he turned his attention to\\r\\nheavier-than-air machines, and in 1906 created a world\\'s record in a\\r\\nflight of 230 yards at a speed of twenty-five miles an hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1907 Henry Farnum made a half circular flight in a Voisin biplane,\\r\\nusing a fifty-horse-power motor, returning to his starting point. About\\r\\nthis time a flight of nine minutes and fifteen seconds was recorded by\\r\\nDelagrande on a Voisin constructed biplane.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first previously announced public flight was made on July 4, 1908,\\r\\nby Glenn H. Curtiss at Hammondsport, N. Y., and was witnessed by a\\r\\nnumber of New Yorkers who had gone to Hammondsport to see the flight.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the winter of 1913-14 Mr. Rodman Wanamaker gave Glenn H. Curtiss a\\r\\ncommission to build a flying boat which would fly across the Atlantic.\\r\\nCommander Porte was brought from England, and he, with Mr. Curtiss,\\r\\nworked out the designs for a flying boat much larger than any previously\\r\\nbuilt, and fitted with two motors instead of one. As entirely separate\\r\\npower plants would be used, one motor would naturally run somewhat\\r\\nfaster than the other, and it was freely predicted that the machine\\r\\ncould not be handled. The first trial, however, proved that it would not\\r\\nonly fly, but that after it was once in the air, one motor could be\\r\\nslowed down and even stopped and the machine continue to fly. This\\r\\nmachine was the forerunner of the seaplane, used by the American,\\r\\nBritish and other navies in the war, although somewhat changed in\\r\\ndetail. The beginning of the war stopped the transatlantic experiments\\r\\nand this machine found its way into the British navy. It was christened\\r\\nthe \"America,\" and the larger flying boats or seaplanes which are now\\r\\nbeing built and used by the British and American navies are still known\\r\\nas the \"America\" or super-American type.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first fighting operations were carried out by individual aviators or\\r\\ncomparatively small squadrons, but the battles of March, 1918, witnessed\\r\\nthe definite development of larger squadrons, maneuvering as effectively\\r\\nas bodies of cavalry, and in massed formation attacking infantry\\r\\ncolumns. The possibilities of the new aerial arm were further\\r\\ndemonstrated in the creation of a barrage, as effective as that of heavy\\r\\nartillery, for the purpose of holding back advancing bodies of infantry.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first days of the German offensive there took place an aerial\\r\\nbattle which up to that time was unique in the annals of warfare. It was\\r\\na battle not merely for the purpose of gaining the mastery of the air,\\r\\nbut to aid Allied infantry and artillery in stemming the tide of the\\r\\nGerman advance, and when the drive finally slowed down and came to a\\r\\nhalt in Picardy, the Allied airmen had undoubtedly contributed largely\\r\\nto the result.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring March 21 and 22, 1918--the opening days of the great German\\r\\ndrive--there was comparatively little aerial activity. The aviators of\\r\\nboth sides were preparing for the impending battle, which actually began\\r\\non the morning of March 23d and lasted all that day and the day\\r\\nfollowing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story of the air battle of March 23d-24th reads like one of the most\\r\\nextraordinary adventure tales ever imagined. The struggle began with\\r\\nsquadrons of airplanes ascending and maneuvering as perfectly as\\r\\ncavalry. They rose to dizzy heights, and, descending, swept the air\\r\\nclose to the ground. The individual pilots of the opposing sides then\\r\\nbegan executing all manner of movements, climbing, diving, turning in\\r\\nevery direction, and seeking to get into the best position to pour\\r\\nmachine-gun fire into enemy airplanes. Every few minutes a machine\\r\\nbelonging to an Allied or German squadron crashed to the ground, often\\r\\nin flames. At the end of the first day\\'s fighting wrecked airplanes and\\r\\nthe mangled bodies of aviators lay strewn all over the battle-field.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll next day, March 24th, the struggle in the air went on with unabated\\r\\nfury. The Allied air squadrons were now on the offensive and penetrated\\r\\nfar inside the German lines. The German aviators counter-attacked\\r\\nwhenever they could, and more than once succeeded in crossing the French\\r\\nlines. But at the close of the second day victory rested with the Allied\\r\\nairmen, and during the next five scarcely a German airplane took the\\r\\nair.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sudden termination of the war caused speculation throughout the\\r\\nworld concerning the future of the airplane. When rumor declared that\\r\\nAmerica\\'s newly-won pre-eminence in aviation would disappear, Captain\\r\\nRoy N. Francis, of the Division of Military Aeronautics, made this\\r\\nstatement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerica cannot afford to junk the airplane fleet which has cost her so\\r\\nmany millions of dollars. I do not believe that any other nation will do\\r\\nso. Even if the peace congress should decide on universal disarmament,\\r\\nthere are still any number of uses to which airplanes can be put in time\\r\\nof peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nTake the air mail service, for instance. This is now only in its\\r\\ninfancy, but it is destined to become as common as the railway mail\\r\\nservice. It will employ hundreds of airplanes and aviators all over the\\r\\ncountry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen there is the possibility of our machines being used for seacoast\\r\\npatrol work, a valuable addition to our coast-guard forces which save\\r\\nmany ocean vessels from disaster every year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey will be largely used for army dispatch work. Instead of sending\\r\\nofficial messages from post to post by the present methods, airplanes\\r\\nwill be used after the war as they are now being used at the front.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the Great Lakes, airplanes can be used for coast-guard work, as on\\r\\nthe seacoast, and they can also be used for patrolling the lakes\\r\\nthemselves. Think how many wrecked lake vessels might have been saved in\\r\\nthe past had there been an airplane nearby to carry its message of\\r\\ndistress and guide rescue ships to the scene.\\r\\n\\r\\nForest patrol is still another opening for the use of expert aviators.\\r\\nEvery year, almost, our great forest fires in the northwest demonstrate\\r\\nthat our present methods of prevention of forest fires are faulty;\\r\\nchiefly because the fires are not discovered while they are still\\r\\nsmoldering. Constant airplane patrol over our great forests would make\\r\\nforest fires a thing of the past.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen there are any number of commercial uses to which airplanes can be\\r\\nput. Instead of a cargo of bombs, a commercial airplane could carry a\\r\\ncargo of small package freight for which immediate delivery is\\r\\nnecessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of the airplane for passenger carrying is now being developed.\\r\\nThe huge Caproni and Handley-Page machines will be used for this purpose\\r\\nin the future. Thousands of persons will want to fly just for the\\r\\nnovelty, and the possibility of accidents will be reduced to the\\r\\nminimum.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, there is the need for scientific research and improvement of the\\r\\nairplane, which will keep scores of men and machines busy for years.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will not be necessary, of course, to maintain the numerous government\\r\\ntraining fields for aviators after the war, but some of the best of them\\r\\nshould be retained. I do not believe it will be necessary to discharge a\\r\\nsingle pilot or observer from the army or to junk a single undamaged\\r\\nairplane after the war.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry Woodhouse, Governor of the Aero Club of America and a world-wide\\r\\nauthority on aeronautics, made the following forecast:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAircraft capable of lifting fifteen tons, with a speed of one hundred\\r\\nmiles an hour, are now in actual production. The first of the\\r\\nAmerican-built Caproni planes, equipped with four Liberty motors and\\r\\ndeveloping 1,750 horse-power has just been successfully tested. This\\r\\ngiant plane has a total lifting capacity of 40,000 pounds, or twenty\\r\\ntons. The super-Handley-Page or the Caproni could easily carry fifty\\r\\nbags, or more than a ton of mail. This means 100,000 letters. Judging\\r\\nthe future development of aircraft by what has taken place in the last\\r\\ntwo years, we may look for the building of a 5,000-horse-power airplane,\\r\\npossibly within a year.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the people of the various cities along the eight great air-ways\\r\\nalready proposed insist on it, at least a dozen additional aerial mail\\r\\nlines can be established within twelve months. This can be done by\\r\\nutilizing only machines not needed by the army or navy. That means it\\r\\nwill be possible to send by postplane at least 50,000,000 of the\\r\\n100,000,000 day and night letters, and at least 25,000,000 of the\\r\\n50,000,000 special delivery letters that are sent each year in the\\r\\nUnited States.\\r\\n\\r\\nPostoffice officials estimate that the average cost of telegraphic day\\r\\nand night letters now going over the wires is close to one dollar each.\\r\\nSpecial delivery letters average about thirteen cents apiece.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis makes a total of more than fifty million dollars\\' worth of\\r\\npotential aerial mail business that is simply waiting for the\\r\\nestablishment of aerial mail routes which can easily be established\\r\\nwithin the next twelve months.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour hundred miles is the distance over which postplane day mail is most\\r\\neffective. Aerial mail letters are effective over any distance, since,\\r\\nwith proper stations, light signals and guides for night postplane\\r\\nflying, the air mail can be carried more than one thousand miles between\\r\\nthe hours of 6 P. M. and 8 A. M.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cost of aerial mail night and day letters will be less than that of\\r\\nwire communication. The cost of an aerial mail letter is sixteen cents\\r\\nfor two ounces. For this price there can be sent a message that would\\r\\ncost five dollars to send by telegraph.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe estimate of $50,000,000 of potential postplane business takes no\\r\\naccount of the possibilities of transporting parcel post aerial mail.\\r\\nOne of the Caproni 2,100-horse-power machines now in operation could\\r\\neasily transport 2,500 pounds of mail. At least $25,000,000 worth of\\r\\nparcel post could be sent by airplane.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnthusiasts who look forward to the transatlantic transportation of\\r\\naerial mail as certain to come within the next twelve-month assert that\\r\\nthere is another twenty-five million dollars\\' worth of transatlantic\\r\\nmail waiting for an aerial mail service. They point out that Uncle Sam\\r\\nnow pays eighty cents a pound to American steamships to carry\\r\\ntransatlantic mail and that a charge of one dollar per letter across the\\r\\nAtlantic would be a paying proposition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Painting]\\r\\n  Copyright Illustrated London News.\\r\\n  PICKING ONE \"OFF THE TAIL\"\\r\\n  The German Albatross airplane going down in flames was in pursuit of\\r\\n  the light British \"Quick\" machine seen on the left, when suddenly a\\r\\n  British Nieuport (at the right) dived through the clouds. The\\r\\n  Albatross nose-dived, the British following with his guns working, and\\r\\n  soon the German burst into flames and crashed to earth, his pursuer\\r\\n  straightening out his course.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph]\\r\\n  CARRYING THE WAR INTO GERMANY\\r\\n  Mechanics \"tuning up\" one of the giant British bombing machines\\r\\n  developed in 1918 that raided Germany. The size is shown by comparison\\r\\n  with the human figures. Note the forward gunner, the pilot, the rear\\r\\n  gunner and the window of the commodious cock-pit within which the\\r\\n  airmen could stand upright.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCharges of mismanagement and graft were investigated by the United\\r\\nStates Senate and by the Department of Justice. Former Justice of the\\r\\nUnited States Supreme Court Charles E. Hughes was named by President\\r\\nWilson to conduct the latter inquiry. Waste was found, due largely to\\r\\nthe emergency nature of the contract. Justice Hughes recommended that\\r\\nCol. Edward Deeds, of the United States Signal Corps, be tried by court\\r\\nmartial for his connection with certain contracts, and recommended that\\r\\nseveral other persons be tried in the United States courts. Justice\\r\\nHughes and the Senate Investigation Committee gave their unqualified\\r\\napproval to the management of America\\'s aircraft production by John D.\\r\\nRyan. Mr. Ryan resigned his charge as head of the Aircraft Production\\r\\nBoard in November, 1918. His last public announcement was of the\\r\\ninvention of an aerial telephone, by which the commander of a squadron\\r\\nstanding on the ground could communicate with-aviators flying in battle\\r\\nformation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLIX\\r\\n\\r\\nHEALTH AND HAPPINESS OF THE AMERICAN FORCES\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the fateful day when Cain slew Abel, thereby setting a precedent\\r\\nfor human warfare, no fighter has been so well protected from disease\\r\\nand discomfort of mind and body, so speedily cured of his wounds, as the\\r\\nAmerican soldier and sailor during the World War.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basis of this remarkable achievement was sanitary education preached\\r\\nfirst by competent physicians and sociologists; then by newspapers to\\r\\nthe civilian population; and ultimately by the soldiers and sailors\\r\\nthemselves, each man acting as an evangel of personal and community\\r\\nhealth and sanitation. In 1914, before war was declared, the words\\r\\n\"venereal diseases\" were relegated to the advertisements of quacks and\\r\\npatent medicines. When the war ended, virtually every young and old man\\r\\nand woman knew the meaning of the words and the miseries that come in\\r\\ntheir train. So it was with other details of the care of the human body,\\r\\nwith sewage problems, with the grave community question of pure water,\\r\\nwith the use of intoxicating beverages, and with other problems\\r\\ninter-woven with the health and happiness of humanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the leaders in this wide-flung campaign of education was the\\r\\nAmerican Red Cross. Starting with a mere nominal membership before the\\r\\nwar, its roster rose to the mighty total of more than 28,000,000\\r\\nAmerican men, women and children when the war ended. More than\\r\\n$300,000,000 was poured into the American Red Cross treasury. In\\r\\naddition to these contributions of money, came the free services of\\r\\nmillions of Americans, mostly women. Red Cross workshops dotted the\\r\\nland, and from these came bandages, sweaters, comfort-kits, trench\\r\\nnecessities, clothing for homeless refugees, and a vast quantity of\\r\\nmaterial aid in every conceivable form. American Red Cross workers\\r\\nduring the war knitted 14,089,000 garments for the army and navy. In\\r\\naddition, the workers turned out 253,196,000 surgical dressings,\\r\\n22,255,000 hospital garments and 1,464,000 refugee garments.  Sewing\\r\\nchapters repaired old clothing and sent it overseas to the orphaned and\\r\\nthe widowed, and millions of Americans learned the sublime lesson of\\r\\nsacrifice through the Red Cross--a lesson that left its imprint upon\\r\\nAmerica for generations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe work of the American Red Cross extended through many lands. It\\r\\nfollowed the flags of the Entente Allies into Palestine, Mesopotamia,\\r\\nIndia, South Africa, and other battle-grounds. Its work on the western\\r\\nfront was a miracle of achievement. In Russia through the Red Terror of\\r\\nthe Revolution the workers of the American Red Cross went serenely about\\r\\ntheir tasks of mercy, relieving the hungry, aiding the sick, and\\r\\nclothing the ragged peasants.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry P. Davidson left the firm of J. P. Morgan & Company to devote his\\r\\nadministrative genius to the affairs of the American Red Cross. Other\\r\\nmen and women of rare executive ability joined in the free tender of\\r\\ntheir services to the work of the Red Cross.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the organization strove mightily against famines, wounds and\\r\\ndisease overseas, it was suddenly confronted during the period from\\r\\nSeptember 8th to November 9th, 1918, with the severest epidemic America\\r\\nhad experienced in generations. Returning American troops brought the\\r\\ngerms of the malady known as \"Spanish influenza\" into New York and\\r\\nBoston. Thence it spread throughout the country. During its brief career\\r\\nthe epidemic claimed a total of 82,306 deaths in forty-six American\\r\\ncities, having a combined population of 23,000,000. Philadelphia, a\\r\\ngreat center of war industry, with the Philadelphia Navy Yard harboring\\r\\nthousands of sailors and marines, showed the highest mortality in\\r\\nproportion to population, 7.4 per 1,000; Baltimore with 6.7 per 1,000\\r\\nshowed the next greatest mortality.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe record of the Red Cross in this epidemic was one of instant service.\\r\\nHundreds of thousands of masks were made in Red Cross workrooms, and\\r\\nthese were worn by nurses and by members of families in afflicted homes.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 1, 1917, just before the appointment of the War Council, the\\r\\nAmerican Red Cross had 486,194 members working through 562 chapters. On\\r\\nJuly 31, 1918, the organization numbered 20,648,103 annual members,\\r\\nbesides 8,000,000 members of the Junior Red Cross--a total enrollment of\\r\\nover one-fourth the population of the United States. These members\\r\\ncarried on their Red Cross work through 3,854 chapters, which again\\r\\ndivided themselves into some 30,000 branches and auxiliaries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total actual collections from the first war fund amounted to more\\r\\nthan $115,000,000. The subscriptions to the second war fund amounted to\\r\\nupward of $176,000,000. From membership dues the collections\\r\\napproximated $24,500,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Home Service of the Red Cross with its more than 40,000 workers,\\r\\nextended its ministrations of sympathy and counsel each month to upward\\r\\nof 100,000 families left behind by soldiers at the front.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupplementing, but not duplicating, the work of the American Red Cross,\\r\\nwere the services of the Y. M. C. A., Y. W. C. A., Knights of Columbus,\\r\\nJewish Welfare Association, Salvation Army, American Library Association\\r\\nand other bodies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese operated under the general supervision of the War and Navy\\r\\ndepartments: Commissions on Training Camp Activities. Raymond B. Fosdick\\r\\nwas the chairman of both these bodies. Concerning these commissions,\\r\\nPresident Wilson declared:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not believe it an exaggeration to say that no army ever before\\r\\nassembled has had more conscientious and painstaking thought given to\\r\\nthe protection and stimulation of its mental, moral and physical\\r\\nmanhood. Every endeavor has been made to surround the men, both here and\\r\\nabroad, with the kind of environment which a democracy owes to those who\\r\\nfight in its behalf. In this work the Commissions on Training Camp\\r\\nActivities have represented the government and the government\\'s\\r\\nsolicitude that the moral and spiritual resources of the nation should\\r\\nbe mobilized behind the troops. The country is to be congratulated upon\\r\\nthe fine spirit with which organizations and groups of many kinds, some\\r\\nof them of national standing, have harnessed themselves together under\\r\\nthe leadership of the government\\'s agency in a common ministry to the\\r\\nmen of the army and navy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfloat and ashore the organizations operating under the supervision of\\r\\nthe two commissions gave to the men of the American forces home care,\\r\\nsuitable recreation, and constant protection. The club life of the army\\r\\nand navy, both in the training camps and after the men went into the\\r\\nservice, was most capably directed by the Y. M. C. A., Knights of\\r\\nColumbus, and the Jewish Welfare Association. Non-sectarianism was the\\r\\nrule in all of the huts and clubs conducted by these organizations.\\r\\nCatholic, Protestant and Jewish chaplains mingled with workers of the\\r\\nSalvation Army, with professional prize-fighters who became athletic\\r\\ninstructors, with actors and actresses who contributed their talents\\r\\nfreely to the entertainment of soldiers and sailors. Moving-picture\\r\\nshows, boxing contests, continuation schools, canteens where women\\r\\nworkers served American-made dishes--these were some of the activities\\r\\nfollowing the men. The Y. M. C. A. and Knights of Columbus bore the\\r\\nlargest share of this work. More than $300,000,000 was contributed by\\r\\nthe people of America to the maintenance of these activities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other organizations rounded out the work of the first two\\r\\norganizations and filled in with special attention to needs on which the\\r\\nothers did not specialize.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe larger organization, the Y. M. C. A., was chosen by the government\\r\\nto carry out a portion of the government program--the conducting of the\\r\\ncanteens.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Knights of Columbus specialized in comforts less considered by other\\r\\nwar relief organizations.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing gave greater relaxation to the fighting man, coming from the\\r\\ntrenches, or the battle line caked with mud and blood and weary with\\r\\nlong hours, than a shower bath, and generous facilities were provided\\r\\nclose to the fighting front.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack of the lines in the rest billets and concentration camps,\\r\\nprovisions were less generous than at the front until the Knights of\\r\\nColumbus took up the task of seeing that the men who were temporarily\\r\\naway from the active fighting had these facilities for bathing. It was\\r\\nbut one of the many activities of the Knights of Columbus, but one of\\r\\nthe most appreciated.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the first requisitions made by Rev. John B. De Valles, one of the\\r\\nfirst chaplains sent over by the Knights of Columbus, was for a shower\\r\\nbath and he set it up in connection with his headquarters in a little\\r\\nFrench town and it was overworked from the first. From this spread the\\r\\nmovement for establishing shower baths in club houses being opened\\r\\nbehind the lines and in villages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no preaching in a Knights of Columbus hall or club room, but\\r\\nthere was clean moral environment and healthy recreation and amusement,\\r\\nfor this was proven the thing to keep up the morale of fighting men.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Y. M. C. A. built 1,500 huts in Europe costing from $2,000 to\\r\\n$20,000 each, equipped with canteen, reading and writing and\\r\\nrecreational facilities to soldiers. It operated twenty-eight different\\r\\nleave areas with hotels that had a total of 35,000 beds. In addition, in\\r\\nParis, port towns, and several big centers in the war zone there were\\r\\n\"Y\" hotels for transient soldiers where one could get a clean bed and a\\r\\ngood meal at about half the price charged by French hotels. Over 3,000\\r\\nmovie and theatrical shows a week were provided free, and 300 \"Y\"\\r\\nathletic directors had charge of the sports in the American army,\\r\\noperating 836 athletic fields. Enormous quantities of cookies and\\r\\nchocolate and cigarettes were supplied.\\r\\n\\r\\nA hundred of the best known educators from America directed educational\\r\\nwork. The staff consisted of Professor Erskine of Columbia University,\\r\\nProfessor Daly of Harvard, Professor Coleman of Chicago University,\\r\\nProfessor Appleton of the University of Kansas and Frank Spaulding,\\r\\nsuperintendent of the Cleveland public schools.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeconding the work of the Y. M. C. A., its sister organization, the Y.\\r\\nW. C. A., extended its activities from the training camps of America to\\r\\nthe battle-fields of Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the close of its first year of America\\'s participation in the war,\\r\\nthe Y. W. C. A. had six established lines of work in France:\\r\\n\\r\\nHostess Houses, clubs for French working women and business girls, clubs\\r\\nfor nurses with the American army, clubs for women of the signal corps,\\r\\nclubs for British women (Waac\\'s) working with the American army, and\\r\\nrecreation work for all women employed in any way by the American\\r\\nExpeditionary Force. In one year its activities spread to twenty-five\\r\\ncities, and it had forty-three units.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hostess Houses were at Paris and Tours. The Hotel Petrograd, on the\\r\\nRue Caumartin, was leased in Paris and turned out to be one of the most\\r\\ninteresting centers of American life in France. It was run on the most\\r\\nliberal lines, in a thoroughly democratic way. The meals were good and\\r\\nin the big dining-room men were admitted on the same footing as women.\\r\\nThere were two of these Hostess Houses at Tours.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the girls of the signal corps twenty-two homes were opened and there\\r\\nwere huts for the Waacs at Bourges and Tours. Y. W. C. A. secretaries\\r\\nwere attached to twenty base hospital units and opened fourteen clubs\\r\\nfor nurses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most interesting and unique work of the Y. W. C. A. was that of its\\r\\nfoyers for French working women and business girls. There were thirteen\\r\\nof these in Lyons, Rouen, Bourges, Tours, Ste. Etienne, Paris and Mont\\r\\nLucon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Salvation Army erected hotels at the various large training camps in\\r\\nAmerica, and its workers made American doughnuts for the soldiers close\\r\\nto the battle-lines in France. The work done by the men and women of the\\r\\nSalvation Army aided materially in bringing the heart of America into\\r\\nFrance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Jewish Welfare Association not only performed notable service in\\r\\nfollowing the men from training camps into actual service, but it also\\r\\nplanned and executed a great reconstruction program under the direction\\r\\nof Felix M. Warburg, chairman of the Joint Distribution Committee.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American Library Association solved the grave problem of providing\\r\\nthe soldiers and sailors with suitable reading matter. Each of the\\r\\ncantonments had its special library building in charge of a trained\\r\\nlibrarian, and interesting literature followed the men into the field\\r\\nthrough the services of this organization.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome idea of the work of these various organizations is gained by\\r\\nreading the following order received by Raymond B. Fosdick at his\\r\\nheadquarters in Washington after the steamship Kansas carrying supplies\\r\\nfor the various huts at American field quarters, was sunk:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSend 20 tons plain soap, 20 tons condensed milk, 10 tons chocolate, 5\\r\\ntons cocoa, 2 tons tea, 5 tons coffee, 5 tons vanilla wafers, 50 tons\\r\\nsugar, 20 tons flour, 2 tons fruit essences, 2 tons lemonade powder,\\r\\n120,000 Testaments, 120,000 hymn-books, tons of magazines and other\\r\\nliterature, 30 tons writing-paper and envelopes, 50,000 folding chairs,\\r\\n500 camp cots, 2,000 blankets, 20 typewriters, 60 tents, 75\\r\\nmoving-picture machines, 200 phonographs, 5,000 records, 1 ton ink\\r\\nblotters, $75,000 worth athletic goods, 30 automobiles and trucks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe order was filled at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides the associations above enumerated, other volunteer organizations\\r\\ncontributed to the health and happiness of American soldiers and\\r\\nsailors. The Emergency Aid of Pennsylvania established two clubs, one in\\r\\nParis, the other in Tours, both of which performed notable services in\\r\\nfeeding and restoring the spirits of American soldiers and sailors. The\\r\\nclub in Paris was under the direction of the Rev. Frederick W. Beekman,\\r\\nand that at Tours was directed by Amos Tuck French. Mrs. Barclay\\r\\nWarburton of Philadelphia was designated by Governor Brumbaugh as\\r\\nCommissioner-General of Overseas Work for the Emergency Aid. Other\\r\\nstates had similar organizations looking after the comfort of the men.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was upon the professional doctors, nurses and sanitarians that\\r\\nthe bulk of the task devolved. This task included the prevention as well\\r\\nas the cure of maladies menacing the American forces. It reached out\\r\\ninto years after the war into the problems of re-education and\\r\\nre-habilitation of the shell-shocked and the wounded. Major-General\\r\\nWilliam C. Gorgas, former Surgeon General of the Army, stated this\\r\\nconcept when he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The whole conception of governmental and national responsibility for\\r\\ncaring for the wounded has undergone radical change during the months of\\r\\nstudy given the subject by experts serving with the Medical Officers\\'\\r\\nReserve Corps and others consulting with them. Instead of the old idea\\r\\nthat responsibility ended with the return of the soldier to private life\\r\\nwith his wounds healed and such pension as he might be given, it is now\\r\\nconsidered that it is the duty of the government to equip and re-educate\\r\\nthe wounded man, after healing his wounds, and to return him to civil\\r\\nlife ready to be as useful to himself and his country as possible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo carry out this idea reconstruction hospitals were established in\\r\\nlarge centers of population. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore,\\r\\nWashington, Buffalo, Cincinnati, Chicago, St. Paul, Seattle, San\\r\\nFrancisco, Los Angeles, Denver, Kansas City, St. Louis, Memphis,\\r\\nRichmond, Atlanta and New Orleans were sites of these institutions. Each\\r\\nwas planned as a 500-bed hospital but with provision for enlargement to\\r\\n1,000 beds if needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese hospitals were not the last step in the return of the wounded\\r\\nsoldiers to civil life. When the soldiers were able to take up\\r\\nindustrial training, further provision was ready.\\r\\n\\r\\nArrangements were made by the Department of Military Orthopedics to care\\r\\nfor soldiers, so far as orthopedics (the prevention of deformity) was\\r\\nconcerned, continuously until they were returned to civil life.\\r\\nOrthopedic surgeons were attached to the medical force near the firing\\r\\nline and to the different hospitals back to the base orthopedic hospital\\r\\nwhich was established within one hundred miles of the firing line. In\\r\\nthis hospital, in addition to orthopedic surgical care, there was\\r\\nequipment for surgical reconstruction work and \"curative workshops\" in\\r\\nwhich men acquired ability to use injured members while doing work\\r\\ninteresting and useful in itself. This method supplanted the old and\\r\\ntiresome one of prescribing a set of motions for a man to go through\\r\\nwith no other purpose than to re-acquire use of his injured part.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstructors and examiners for all the troops were furnished by the\\r\\nDepartment of Military Orthopedic Surgery. A number of older and more\\r\\nexperienced surgeons acted as instructors and supervisors for each of\\r\\nthe groups into which the army was divided.\\r\\n\\r\\nA peculiar condition arising from the use of heavy artillery in the war\\r\\nwas that called \"shell-shock.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most pathetic wrecks of war were soldiers suffering from shattered\\r\\nnerves. Paris had many of them. They appeared to be normal. But they\\r\\nwere human wrecks.\\r\\n\\r\\nShell-shock or the aftermath of illness from wounds left them in\\r\\nweakened health, subject to violent heart attacks. Most of them lacked\\r\\nenergy and perseverance. They became awkward, like big children. If\\r\\nemployment was found for them--for many had large families to\\r\\nsupport--they quickly lost their jobs through apathy or collapse.\\r\\n\\r\\nA society in Paris did everything possible to relieve the sufferings of\\r\\nthese victims of the war. It operated with the authorization of the\\r\\nFrench Government under the name \"L\\'Assistance aux Blesses Nerveux de\\r\\nla Guerre.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican hospitals after the war contained many of these cases. Some of\\r\\nthe victims became incurably insane.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides the noble work done by the great army of American physicians,\\r\\nsurgeons and nurses, in caring for soldiers and sailors, a service of\\r\\nscarcely less magnitude was rendered to the civilian populations of\\r\\nFrance, Belgium and Italy. Tuberculosis in France was a real plague,\\r\\ntaking a toll of 80,000 lives every year. American physicians and nurses\\r\\npreached the doctrine of fresh air, care of the teeth and proper food\\r\\nfor children. Almost immediately this campaign of sanitation had its\\r\\neffect in a decreasing death-rate from tuberculosis.\\r\\n\\r\\nEuropean nations generally were benefited by the stay of the American\\r\\narmy overseas. The straightforward manner in which the social evil was\\r\\nattacked had direct benefits. The important detail of dental care also\\r\\nreceived an interest through the advent of the American soldier. The\\r\\nLondon Daily Mail made this comment on that question:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One thing about the American soldiers and sailors must strike English\\r\\npeople when they see these gallant fighters, and that is the soundness\\r\\nand general whiteness of their teeth. From childhood the \\'Yank\\' is\\r\\ntaught to take care of his teeth. He has \\'tooth drill\\' thrice daily and\\r\\nvisits his dentist at fixed periods, say, every three or four months. If\\r\\nby chance a tooth does decay, the rot is at once arrested by gold or\\r\\nplatinum filling. American dentists never extract a tooth. No matter how\\r\\nbadly decayed it may be, they save the molar by crowning it with gold.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The United States soldiers have set us a splendid example in this\\r\\nmatter. They fairly shame the ordinary \\'Tommy\\' by the brilliance of\\r\\ntheir molars, but they will do so no longer if young English mothers\\r\\nwill only wake up to the fact that bad teeth cause bad health, and that\\r\\ndoctors\\' and dentists\\' bills will be saved by the regular use of the\\r\\ntooth-brush.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER L\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PIRATES OF THE UNDER-SEAS\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany relied upon the submarine to win the war. This in a nut-shell\\r\\nexplains the main reason why the United States was drawn into the World\\r\\nWar. Von Tirpitz, the German Admiral, obsessed with the theory that no\\r\\neffective answer could be made to the submarine, convinced the German\\r\\nHigh Command and the Kaiser that only through unrestricted submarine\\r\\nwarfare could England be starved and the war brought to an end with\\r\\nvictory for Germany. Since August, 1914, the theory held by von Tirpitz\\r\\nand his party of extremists had been combated by Prince Maximilian of\\r\\nBaden and by Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg and by others high in the\\r\\ncouncil of the Kaiser. These men pointed out that, leaving out such\\r\\nquestions as piracy on the high seas, the drowning of women and\\r\\nchildren, the destruction of the property of neutrals, there still\\r\\nremained the question of expediency. America, they asserted, was certain\\r\\nto enter the war if unrestricted submarine warfare was decreed. These\\r\\nmen were denounced as cowards and von Tirpitz finally triumphed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe submarine employed by the Germans was of the type designed by Simon\\r\\nLake, an American. The Germans bought two submarines built by Mr. Lake\\r\\nat Kronstadt for the Russians during the Russian-Japanese war. Various\\r\\nimprovements upon the Diesel engine and special training for submarine\\r\\ncrews enabled the German navy to strike terrible blows during the early\\r\\npart of the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle by little, however, the Allies discovered the answer to the\\r\\nsubmarine menace. One of these was the convoy: fleets of merchant\\r\\nvessels surrounded by fast destroyers made life a misery for the\\r\\nsubmarine crews. In the early days vessels of all character fled from\\r\\nthe approach of the submarine. The destroyers of the convoys, however,\\r\\nadopted a different method. They rushed at the periscopes in efforts to\\r\\nram the submarine, and as they raced over the spot where the submarine\\r\\nhad been at the rate of twenty-two knots or more an hour, they dropped\\r\\nhuge containers, dubbed \"ash cans\", containing depth charges of\\r\\ntrinitrotoluol.\\r\\n\\r\\nSea planes carrying bombs, small dirigible balloons known as \"blimps,\"\\r\\nobservation balloons moored on the decks of warships, steel nets, and\\r\\nespecially devised anti-submarine mines, were also factors in the\\r\\ngeneral work of submarine destruction.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to all these, every ship, both cargo carrier and war vessel,\\r\\nhad its well-trained gun crew, and hundreds of thousands of keen-eyed\\r\\nmariners daily and nightly swept the seas with binoculars watching for\\r\\nanything that resembled a periscope.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a consequence of this combination of destructive agencies the British\\r\\nAdmiralty was enabled to announce at the close of the war that more than\\r\\n150 German submarines had been destroyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe names of the commanding officers of the German submarines which had\\r\\nbeen disposed of were given out by the government in order to\\r\\nsubstantiate to the world the statement made by the Prime Minister in\\r\\nthe House of Commons on August 7th, and denied in the German papers,\\r\\nthat \"at least 150 of these ocean pests had been destroyed.\" The\\r\\nstatement included no officers commanding the Austrian submarines, of\\r\\nwhich a number had been destroyed, and did not exhaust the list of\\r\\nGerman submarines put out of action.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fate of the officers was given, and of these the majority (116) were\\r\\ndead; twenty-seven were prisoners of war, six were interned in neutral\\r\\ncountries where they took refuge, and one succeeded in returning to\\r\\nGermany.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther light on the subject of German submarines was given on September\\r\\n18, 1918, by Senator William H. Thompson of Kansas in a speech in which\\r\\nhe told the Senate:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe submarine is no longer a serious menace to transportation across the\\r\\nseas. It is, of course, an annoyance and a great hindrance, and as long\\r\\nas there is a single submarine in the waters of the sea every effort\\r\\nmust be made by the allied powers to destroy it, for it is an outlaw and\\r\\nmust not exist. The truth is that Germany never had more than 320\\r\\nsubmarines all told, including all construction before and since the\\r\\nwar.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have positive knowledge of the destruction of more than one-half of\\r\\nthese submarines, and we also know that it is practically impossible for\\r\\nGermany to keep in operation more than 10 per cent of those remaining.\\r\\nIt is therefore reduced to a negligible quantity so far as its ultimate\\r\\neffect upon the result of the war is concerned.\\r\\n\\r\\n1 saw a reliable statement in France to the effect that there is one\\r\\nship of some character leaving the eastern shores of America for the war\\r\\nzone every six minutes, and it is only a few vessels which are ever\\r\\ntorpedoed, estimated at about one per cent. This is less than the loss\\r\\nby storm and accident in the earlier days of transportation and is not\\r\\nmuch greater than such loss now. We must bear in mind that we read only\\r\\nof the ships which have been torpedoed and see but little account of the\\r\\nhundreds of ships which pass over the ocean safely and undisturbed.\\r\\nThree hundred thousand soldiers are conveyed across the Atlantic every\\r\\nthirty days, and an average of about 500,000 tons of freight carried to\\r\\nthe French coast. There are warehouses in only one of the many ports of\\r\\nFrance with a capacity of over 2,000,000 tons.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is to the navy that the credit for the destruction of this outlaw\\r\\nseagoing craft is due. The navy is and has been the backbone of this\\r\\nwar, the same as it has been of almost every great war in history.\\r\\nWithout the allied navy the submarine would have perhaps accomplished\\r\\nits nefarious purpose in starving the European allies and in preventing\\r\\nthem from securing the necessary munitions of war to defend themselves.\\r\\nIt has utterly failed in this respect. The Allies are amply supplied\\r\\nwith food, and there are provisions enough on hand now, if every ship\\r\\nshould be sunk, to last the Allies and armies for months. The destroyer\\r\\nis the ship which has brought Germany to her knees in submarine warfare\\r\\nand will keep her there. We have not enough destroyers, and it is for\\r\\nthis reason we are obliged in this great transportation problem to run\\r\\nrisks which would not be taken under ordinary conditions. If every ship\\r\\nwas escorted by a sufficient number of destroyers I doubt if there would\\r\\nbe a single ship of any consequence sunk, except by the merest accident.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon the same subject, Sir Eric Geddes, First Lord of the British\\r\\nAdmiralty, on October 14th, reviewing the British effort in the war said\\r\\nthat during 1918 the casualties of the British on the western front\\r\\nequaled those of all the Allies combined. The British navy, he said,\\r\\nsince the beginning of the war had lost in fighting ships of all classes\\r\\na total of 230, more than twice the losses in war vessels of all the\\r\\nAllies.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to these, Great Britain had lost 450 auxiliary craft, such\\r\\nas mine-sweepers and trawlers, making a total of 680. He revealed the\\r\\nfact that the effective warship barrage, which had been drawn between\\r\\nthe Orkneys and Norway against German submarines and surface craft, was,\\r\\nduring the later months of the war, maintained largely by ships of the\\r\\nUnited States.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British merchant ships lost since 1914 exceeded 2,400, representing\\r\\na gross tonnage of 7,750,000, nearly three times the aggregate loss of\\r\\nall other allied and neutral countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his statement on the submarine situation he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February, 1917, the ruthless submarine warfare confronted us, whilst\\r\\nthe armies in France at that time were feeling a sense of superiority\\r\\nover the enemy which was illustrated by the successes of the battle of\\r\\nArras, the taking of Vimy Ridge, the advance between the Ancre and the\\r\\nSomme, the offensive in Champagne, Chemin des Dames, Messines and\\r\\nPasschendaele Ridges. Thus we felt, and rightly felt, that the weakest\\r\\nfront at that time was the sea--not on the surface, but under water.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole of the available energies of the Allies were consequently\\r\\nthrown into overcoming the submarine and the menace which threatened to\\r\\ndestroy the lines of communication of the Alliance. The reduced sinkings\\r\\nwhich have been published since that period show how we gradually\\r\\novercame that menace--and today most men say that the submarine menace\\r\\nis a thing of the past.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat it is a thing of the past in so far as it can never win the war for\\r\\nthe enemy or enable the enemy to prevent us from winning the war,\\r\\nprovided we do not underrate the danger but take adequate steps against\\r\\nit, I affirm now as the opinion of the British Admiralty; but it is a\\r\\nmenace that comes and goes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe end of the great submarine menace came on November 20th, when twenty\\r\\nGerman submarines were officially surrendered to Rear-Admiral Tyrwhitt\\r\\nof the British Navy, thirty miles off Harwich, England. Within the\\r\\nfollowing week more than eighty other German submarines and a number of\\r\\nAustrian craft were also surrendered to the British. The spectacle of\\r\\nthe surrender was most impressive.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter steaming some twenty miles across the North Sea, the Harwich\\r\\nforces, which consisted of five light cruisers and twenty destroyers,\\r\\nwere sighted. The flagship of Admiral Tyrwhitt, the commander, was the\\r\\nCuracao. High above about the squadron hung a big observation balloon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe squadron, headed by the flagship, then steamed toward the Dutch\\r\\ncoast, followed by the Coventry, Dragoon, Danal and Centaur. Other ships\\r\\nfollowed in line with their navigation lights showing. The picture was a\\r\\nnoble one as the great vessels, with the moon still shining, plowed\\r\\ntheir way to take part in the surrender of the German U-boats.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after the British squadron started the \"paravanes\" were dropped\\r\\noverboard. These devices are shaped like tops and divert any mines which\\r\\nmay be encountered, for the vessels were now entering a mine field.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost everyone on board donned a life belt and just as the red sun\\r\\nappeared above the horizon the first German submarine appeared in sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after seven o\\'clock twenty submarines were seen in line,\\r\\naccompanied by two German destroyers, the Tibania and the Sierra\\r\\nVentana, which were to take the submarine crews back to Germany after\\r\\nthe transfer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the submarines were on the surface with their hatches open and their\\r\\ncrews standing on deck. The vessels were flying no flags whatever and\\r\\ntheir guns were trained fore and aft, in accordance with the terms of\\r\\nsurrender.\\r\\n\\r\\nA bugle sounded on the Curacao and all the gun crews took up their\\r\\nstations, ready for any possible treachery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe leading destroyer, in response to a signal from the admiral, turned\\r\\nand led the way towards England and the submarines were ordered to\\r\\nfollow. They immediately did so. The surrender had been accomplished.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach cruiser turned, and, keeping a careful lookout, steamed toward\\r\\nHarwich. On the deck of one of the largest of the submarines, which\\r\\ncarried two 5.9 guns, twenty-three officers and men were counted. The\\r\\ncraft was estimated to be nearly 300 feet in length. Its number had been\\r\\npainted out.\\r\\n\\r\\nNear the Ship Wash lightship three large British seaplanes, followed by\\r\\nan airship, were observed. One of the submarines was seen to send up a\\r\\ncouple of carrier pigeons and at once a signal was flashed from the\\r\\nadmiral that it had no right to do this.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the ships had cleared the mine field and entered the war channel\\r\\nthe \"paravanes\" were hauled aboard. On reaching a point some twenty\\r\\nmiles off Harwich the ships dropped anchor and Captain Addison went out\\r\\non the warship Maidstone.\\r\\n\\r\\nBritish crews were then put on board the submarines to take them into\\r\\nharbor. With the exception of the engine staffs all the German sailors\\r\\nremained on deck. The submarines were then taken through the gates of\\r\\nthe harbor and the German crews were transferred to the transports and\\r\\ntaken back to Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the boats went through the gates a white signal was run up on each of\\r\\nthem with the German flag underneath.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach German submarine commander at the transfer was required to sign a\\r\\ndeclaration to the effect that his vessel was in running order, that its\\r\\nperiscope was intact, that its torpedoes were unloaded and that its\\r\\ntorpedo heads were safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrders had been issued forbidding any demonstration and these\\r\\ninstructions were obeyed to the letter. There was complete silence as\\r\\nthe submarines surrendered and as the crews were transferred.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 21st, the German High Seas fleet that had been protected by\\r\\nthe submarines surrendered to the combined fleet consisting of British,\\r\\nAmerican and French battleships. The British admiralty\\'s terse statement\\r\\nconcerning the historic spectacle follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe commander-in-chief of the Grand Fleet has reported that at 9.30\\r\\no\\'clock this morning he met the first and main installment of the German\\r\\nhigh seas fleet, which is surrendering for internment. Admiral Sir David\\r\\nBeatty is Commander-in-chief of the Grand Fleet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the same day another flotilla of German U-boats also was surrendered\\r\\nto a British squadron. There were nineteen submarines in all; the\\r\\ntwentieth broke down on the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grand Fleet, accompanied by five American battleships and three\\r\\nFrench cruisers, steamed out at 3 o\\'clock on the morning of November\\r\\n21st, from its Scottish base to accept the surrender. The vessels moved\\r\\nin two long columns.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German fleet which surrendered consisted of nine battleships, five\\r\\ncruisers, seven light cruisers and fifty destroyers, Seventy-one vessels\\r\\nin all. There remained to be surrendered two battleships, which were\\r\\nunder repair, and fifty modern torpedo-boat destroyers.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne German destroyer while on its way across the North Sea with the\\r\\nother ships of the German High Seas fleet to surrender struck a mine. It\\r\\nwas so badly damaged that it sank.\\r\\n\\r\\nDescribing the surrender of the German warships to Sir David Beatty, the\\r\\nCommander-in-Chief of the grand fleet, correspondents said that after\\r\\nall the German ships had been taken over, the British admiral went\\r\\nthrough the line on the Queen Elizabeth, every Allied vessel being\\r\\nmanned and greeting the admiral and the flagship with loud and ringing\\r\\ncheers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Painting]\\r\\n  GERMAN PIRACY ON THE HIGH SEAS\\r\\n  After torpedoing their ship the submarine shelled the lifeboats and\\r\\n  jeered at the struggles of the helpless crew.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Painting]\\r\\n  Courtesy of Joseph A.

The first of\\r\\nthese attacks was delivered by the French and Americans in the southern\\r\\nsector which included Verdun and the Argonne. The second smash was\\r\\ndelivered by British, French and Americans in the Cambrai sector. The\\r\\nthird was delivered by British, Belgians, French and Americans in the\\r\\nBelgian sector on the north of the great battle line.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cambrai operation had as its first objectives the possession of the\\r\\nstrategic railways both of which ran from Valenciennes, one to the huge\\r\\ndistribution center at Douai; the other to Cambrai itself. To reach\\r\\nthese objectives the Allies were obliged to cross the Sensee and the\\r\\nEscaut canals under infantry and artillery fire. Besides these natural\\r\\nobstacles, there was the famous Hunding line of fortifications erected\\r\\nby the Germans between the Scarpe and the Oise River.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attack was opened in force on September 18, 1918, by the Fourth\\r\\nBritish army under General Rawlinson and the First French army under\\r\\nGeneral Debeney. The assault was successful northwest of St. Quentin and\\r\\ndetermined German counter-attacks were broken down by French and British\\r\\nartillery fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Third British army under General Byng and the Thirtieth American\\r\\ndivision co-operating with the First British army under Sir Henry\\r\\nHorne, attacked furiously over a fourteen-mile front toward Cambrai. The\\r\\nnet result of this operation was the possession of the Canal du Nord,\\r\\nthe taking of several villages, and 6,000 prisoners. This was on\\r\\nSeptember 27th. The following day the same forces captured\\r\\nFontaine-Notre Dame, Marcoing, Noyelles, and Cantaing. More than 200\\r\\nguns were captured and 10,000 prisoners. On September 29th the Americans\\r\\ntook Bellecourt and Nauroy, and invested the suburbs of Cambrai. The\\r\\nBritish crossed the Escaut canal and the Canadians penetrated some of\\r\\nthe environs of Cambrai.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe resolution and ferocity of the attack thoroughly dismayed the\\r\\nGermans, and the salient produced by the smash forced the Teutons to\\r\\nevacuate the greatly prized Lens coal fields on October 3d. Horne and\\r\\nByng continued their advance, the former occupying Biache-St. Vaast\\r\\nsouthwest of Douai, and the latter reaching a position five miles\\r\\nnorthwest of Cambrai.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaught between the jaws of the pincers, the German forces occupying\\r\\nCambrai made haste to escape outright capture. The city that had been\\r\\nthe objective of British hopes and thrusts for two years, fell into the\\r\\nhands of the Allies. The German retreat extended over a thirty-mile\\r\\nfront and included both St. Quentin and Cambrai. Simultaneously the\\r\\nGerman forces between Arras and St. Quentin fell steadily backward. Le\\r\\nCateau and Zazeuel fell into the hands of the British October 17th,\\r\\nthree thousand prisoners and a quantity of war material being included\\r\\nin the bag.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime General Mangin attacking in the Laon sector, drove the\\r\\nGermans from the strategic Chemin des Dames and with General Berthelot\\r\\ncaptured Berry-au-Bac, the St. Gobain massif and completed contact with\\r\\nGenerals Pershing and Gouraud on the right and with Generals Rawlinson\\r\\nand Debeney on the left.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Allied advance now became a huge steel broom, sweeping the Germans\\r\\nirresistibly before it. The operation extended from the Oise southeast\\r\\nto the Aisne, broadening thence until it included the entire front. The\\r\\nHindenburg line, the Somme battle-field, the Hunding line, were all\\r\\nquickly overrun. The fortress of Maubeuge, fifty miles northeast of St.\\r\\nQuentin, which was connected with that city by a triple railway\\r\\nconnection, was evacuated as a direct result of this operation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen St. Quentin itself fell into the hands of Debeney, it was found\\r\\nthat the Germans had deported the entire civilian population of 50,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the crux of the operations by Foch. Germans were given no rest;\\r\\nnight and day the pressure continued. Every clash showed the increasing\\r\\nsuperiority of the Allies both in men and material and the corresponding\\r\\ndeterioration of the German forces. This demoralization of the Germans\\r\\nextended from the High Command to the private soldier.  Prisoners poured\\r\\ninto the hands of  the Allies. Evacuation of Lille was commenced on\\r\\nOctober 2d and Roubaix and Turcoing also fell.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the beginning of Germany\\'s military debacle. The time was ripe\\r\\nfor the coup-de-grace soon to be delivered by Americans co-operating\\r\\nwith the Allies on a seventy-one mile front.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kaiser, Ludendorf and von Hindenburg abandoned hope. The command\\r\\nwent forth from the German general headquarters to retreat, retreat,\\r\\nretreat, while Prince Maximilian of Baden appealed to America for an\\r\\narmistice. The sword in Germany\\'s hand was broken. Autocracy, defeated\\r\\nin the eyes of its deluded subjects and discredited in the eyes of the\\r\\nworld, was in headlong flight. Its only concern was to save as much as\\r\\npossible from the ruins of the ostentatious temple it had reared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER LII\\r\\n\\r\\nLAST DAYS OF THE WAR\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom November 1st until November 11th, the day when the armistice\\r\\ngranting terms to Germany was signed, the collapse of the German\\r\\ndefensive was complete. The army that under von Hindenburg and Ludendorf\\r\\nhad smashed its way over Poland, Roumania, Serbia, Belgium, and into the\\r\\nheart of France, was now a military machine in full retreat. It is only\\r\\njustice to that machine to say that the great retreat at no place\\r\\ndegenerated into a rout. Von Hindenburg and the German General Staff had\\r\\nplanned a series of rear-guard actions that were effective in protecting\\r\\nthe main bodies of infantry and artillery. Machine-gun nests and\\r\\nairplane attacks were the main reliance of the Germans in these\\r\\nmaneuvers of delay, but the German field artillery also did its share.\\r\\n\\r\\nImmense quantities of material and many thousands of prisoners were\\r\\ncaptured by the British, Canadians and Australians in the north, and by\\r\\nthe French and Americans in the south. Simultaneously with this wide and\\r\\nsavage drive upon the Germans along the Belgian and French fronts, came\\r\\nthe heaviest Italian attack of the war. Before it the Austrians were\\r\\nswept in a torrent that was irresistible. French, English and American\\r\\ntroops co-operated in this thrust that extended from the plains of the\\r\\nPiave into Trentino. The immediate effect of the Italian offensive was\\r\\nto force Austria to her knees in abject surrender. An armistice,\\r\\nhumiliating in its terms, was signed by the Austrian representatives,\\r\\nand the back door to Germany was opened to the Allies.\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany\\'s frantic plea for an armistice followed. There were those in\\r\\nthe Allied countries who maintained that nothing short of unconditional\\r\\nsurrender should be permitted. Cooler counsel prevailed, and an\\r\\narmistice was offered to the German High Command through General Foch,\\r\\nthe terms of which far exceeded in severity those granted to Turkey and\\r\\nAustria. These were read for the first time by Germany\\'s representatives\\r\\non Friday, November 8th. General Foch, when he gave the document to the\\r\\nGerman delegation, declared that Germany\\'s decision must be made within\\r\\nseventy-two hours. Eleven o\\'clock on Monday, November 11th, was the time\\r\\nlimit permitted to Germany. The armistice was signed by General Foch and\\r\\nthe German representatives on the morning of November 11th, but fighting\\r\\ndid not actually cease until eleven o\\'clock, several hours after the\\r\\nterms had been agreed to. This was in accordance with arrangement made\\r\\nbetween the signers.\\r\\n\\r\\nSedan, where Marshals McMahon and Bazaine, commanding the armies of\\r\\nNapoleon III, surrendered to the King of Prussia in 1870, marked the\\r\\nlast notable victory of the American forces in France. The Sedan of 1870\\r\\nmarked the birth of German militarism. The Sedan of 1918 marked its\\r\\ndeath.\\r\\n\\r\\nPreceding the advance of the Americans upon Sedan, came a cloud of\\r\\naviators in pursuit and bombing planes, headed by the famous aces of the\\r\\nAmerican forces. The First and Second divisions of the First army led\\r\\nthe way. In the van of the Second division were the Marines, whose\\r\\nheroism in Belleau Wood marked the beginning of Germany\\'s end. The\\r\\nfamous Rainbow division made the most savage thrust of the action,\\r\\npursuing the foe for ten miles and sweeping the Freya Hills clear of\\r\\nmachine nests and German artillery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last action of the war for the Americans followed immediately on the\\r\\nheels of the battle of Sedan. It was the taking of the town of Stenay.\\r\\nThe engagement was deliberately planned by the Americans as a sort of\\r\\nbattle celebration of the end of the war. The order fixing eleven\\r\\no\\'clock as the time for the conclusion of hostilities, had been sent\\r\\nfrom end to end of the American lines. Its text follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1. You are informed that hostilities will cease along the whole front at\\r\\n11 o\\'clock A. M., November 11, 1918, Paris time.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. No Allied troops will pass the line reached by them at that hour in\\r\\ndate until further orders.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Division commanders will immediately sketch the location of their\\r\\nline. This sketch will be returned to headquarters by the courier\\r\\nbearing these orders.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. All communication with the enemy, both before and after the\\r\\ntermination of hostilities, is absolutely forbidden. In case of\\r\\nviolation of this order severest disciplinary measures will be\\r\\nimmediately taken. Any officer offending will be sent to headquarters\\r\\nunder guard.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Every emphasis will be laid on the fact that the arrangement is an\\r\\narmistice only and not a peace.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. There must not be the slightest relaxation of vigilance. Troops must\\r\\nbe prepared at any moment for further operations.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Special steps will be taken by all commanders to insure strictest\\r\\ndiscipline and that all troops be held in readiness fully prepared for\\r\\nany eventuality.\\r\\n\\r\\n8. Division and brigade commanders will personally communicate these\\r\\norders to all organizations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSignal corps wires, telephones and runners were used in carrying the\\r\\norders and so well did the big machine work that even patrol commanders\\r\\nhad received the orders well in advance of the hour. Apparently the\\r\\nGermans also had been equally diligent in getting the orders to the\\r\\nfront line. Notwithstanding the hard fighting they did Sunday to hold\\r\\nback the Americans, the Germans were able to bring the firing to an\\r\\nabrupt end at the scheduled hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe staff and field officers of the American army were disposed early in\\r\\nthe day to approach the hour of eleven with lessened activity. The day\\r\\nbegan with less firing and doubtless the fighting would have ended\\r\\naccording to plan, had there not been a sharp resumption on the part of\\r\\nGerman batteries. The Americans looked upon this as wantonly useless. It\\r\\nwas then that orders were sent to the battery commanders for increased\\r\\nfire.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough there was no reason for it, German ruthlessness was still\\r\\nrampant Sunday, stirring the American artillery in the region of\\r\\nDun-sur-Meuse and Mouzay to greater activity. Six hundred aged men and\\r\\nwomen and children were in Mouzay when the Germans attacked it with gas.\\r\\nThere was only a small detachment of American troops there and the town\\r\\nno longer was of strategical value. However, it was made the direct\\r\\ntarget of shells filled with phosgene. Every street reeked with gas.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoorly clad and showing plainly evidences of malnutrition, the\\r\\ninhabitants crowded about the Americans, kissing their hands and hailing\\r\\nthem as deliverers. They declared they had had no meat for six weeks.\\r\\nThey virtually had been prisoners of war for four years and were\\r\\noverwhelmed with joy when they learned that an armistice was probable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last French town to fall into American hands before the armistice\\r\\nwent into effect was Stenay. Patrols reported they had found it empty\\r\\nnot more than a quarter of an hour before eleven o\\'clock. American\\r\\ntroops rushed through the town and in a few minutes Allied flags were\\r\\nbeginning to appear from the windows. As the church bell solemnly tolled\\r\\nthe hour of eleven, troops from the Ninetieth division were pouring into\\r\\nthe town.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inhabitants told the usual stories of German treatment. They were\\r\\nforced to work at all sorts of tasks from seven in the morning until six\\r\\nat night. In return they received paper bills with which they were\\r\\nunable to purchase milk and similar necessities. The majority, however,\\r\\nwere so overjoyed at their deliverance that they were almost incoherent\\r\\nin discussing the enemy occupation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inhabitants of Stenay remained hiding in their cellars even after\\r\\nthe Americans had entered the town. They came out hesitatingly and in\\r\\nsmall groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nHostilities along the American front ended with a crash of cannon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe early forenoon had been marked by a falling off in fire all along\\r\\nthe line, but an increasing bombardment from the retreating Germans at\\r\\ncertain points stimulated the Americans to a quick retort. From their\\r\\npositions north of Stenay to southeast of the town the Americans began\\r\\nto bombard fixed targets. The firing reached a volume at times almost\\r\\nequivalent to a barrage.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo minutes before eleven o\\'clock the firing dwindled, the last shells\\r\\nshrieking over No Man\\'s Land precisely on time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was little celebration on the front line, where American routine\\r\\nwas scarcely disturbed over the cessation of fighting. In the areas\\r\\nbehind the battle zone there were celebrations on all sides. Here and\\r\\nthere there were little outbursts of cheering, but even those instances\\r\\nwere not on the immediate front.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the French soldiers went about singing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know,\" drawled a lieutenant from Texas while the\\r\\nartillery was sending its last challenge to the Germans, \"but somehow I\\r\\ncan\\'t help wondering if we have licked them enough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Germans were manifestly so glad over the cessation of hostilities\\r\\nthat they could not conceal their pleasure. Prisoners taken at Stenay\\r\\ngrinned with satisfaction. Their demeanor was in sharp contrast to that\\r\\nof the American doughboys who took the matter philosophically and went\\r\\nabout their appointed tasks.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the front line it was the same. The Americans were happy, but quiet.\\r\\nThey made no demonstrations. The Germans, on the other hand, were in a\\r\\nregular hysteria of joy. They waited only until nightfall to set off\\r\\nevery rocket in their possession. In the evening the sky was ablaze with\\r\\nred, green, blue and yellow flares all along the line.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlags appeared like magic over the shell-torn buildings of Verdun,\\r\\nFrench and American colors flying side by side.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn every village, even those from which the Germans had been driven,\\r\\nthere were flags and decorations which were brought up to the front by\\r\\nthe soldiers. In the villages back of the line there were impromptu\\r\\ncelebrations and the civilians in holiday spirit saluted the Americans,\\r\\nshouting \"the war is finished.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNortheast of Verdun, just before 11 o\\'clock, American artillery-men in\\r\\nloading a six-inch howitzer, wrote \"good-luck\" on a ninety-pound shell\\r\\nand \"let \\'er go.\" The shot was aimed at the crossroad at Ornas, just\\r\\nahead of the American lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the bells of the ancient Verdun Cathedral were ringing the news of\\r\\npeace the fortress city was illuminated and a military procession headed\\r\\nby the drum corps of the Twenty-sixth American division swung along the\\r\\ncrowded streets accompanied by a French detachment of buglers\\r\\nrepresenting the famed defenders of Verdun.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly a half hour before the Germans had thrown large shells within the\\r\\ncity walls, apparently as a reminder that Verdun was still within the\\r\\nrange of their guns to the hills to the northeast.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonday afternoon and night virtually was the first time that Verdun had\\r\\nnot been shelled in many hours almost since the war began.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER LIII\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE DRASTIC TERMS OF SURRENDER\\r\\n\\r\\nThe end of the war came with almost the dramatic suddenness of its\\r\\nbeginning. Bulgaria, hemmed in by armies through which no relief could\\r\\npenetrate, asked for terms. The reply came in two words, \"Unconditional\\r\\nSurrender.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTurkey, witnessing the rout of her army in Palestine by the great\\r\\nstrategist, General Allenby, and a British army, asked for an armistice.\\r\\nThe Porte signed without hesitation an agreement comprising twenty-five\\r\\nsevere requirements.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surrender of Bulgaria and Turkey forced Austria\\'s hand. The terms\\r\\nunder which it was permitted to capitulate were even harder than those\\r\\ngranted to Turkey. They comprised eighteen requirements divided into\\r\\nmilitary and naval clauses.\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany, proud, imperial Germany, met the greatest humiliation of all\\r\\nthe Teutonic allies when the Kaiser and the German High Command were\\r\\nbrought to their knees. Thirty-five clauses, the most severe and drastic\\r\\never demanded from a great power, were included in the armistice\\r\\nagreement. Only the imminent menace of an invasion of Germany would have\\r\\nsufficed to compel the German representatives to sign such a document.\\r\\nFollowing are the drafts of the Turkish, Austrian and German armistice\\r\\nagreements.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TURKISH AGREEMENT\\r\\n\\r\\n1. The opening of the Dardanelles and the Bosporus and access to the\\r\\nBlack Sea. Allied occupation of the Dardanelles and Bosporus forts.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. The positions of all mine fields, torpedo tubes and other\\r\\nobstructions in Turkish waters are to be indicated, and assistance given\\r\\nto sweep or remove them, as may be required.\\r\\n\\r\\n3.

These ships will be interned in such Turkish port or ports as\\r\\nmay be directed, except such small vessels as are required for police\\r\\nand similar purposes in Turkish territorial waters.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. The Allies to have the right to occupy any strategic points in the\\r\\nevent of any situation arising which threatens the security of the\\r\\nAllies.\\r\\n\\r\\n8. Use by Allied ships of all ports and anchorages now in Turkish\\r\\noccupation and denial of their use by the enemy. Similar conditions are\\r\\nto apply to Turkish mercantile shipping in Turkish waters for the\\r\\npurposes of trade and the demobilization of the army.\\r\\n\\r\\n9. Allied occupation of the Taurus Tunnel system.\\r\\n\\r\\n10. Immediate withdrawal of Turkish troops from Northern Persia to\\r\\nbehind the pre-war frontier already has been ordered and will be\\r\\ncarried out.\\r\\n\\r\\n11. A part of Transcaucasia already has been ordered to be evacuated by\\r\\nTurkish troops. The remainder to be evacuated, if required by the\\r\\nAllies, after they have studied the situation.\\r\\n\\r\\n12. Wireless, telegraph and cable stations to be controlled by the\\r\\nAllies. Turkish Government messages to be excepted.\\r\\n\\r\\n13. Prohibition against the destruction of any naval, military or\\r\\ncommercial material.\\r\\n\\r\\n14. Facilities are to be given for the purchase of coal, oil, fuel and\\r\\nnaval material from Turkish sources, after the requirements of the\\r\\ncountry have been met. None of the above materials are to be exported.\\r\\n\\r\\n15. The surrender of all Turkish offices in Tripolitania and Cyrenaica\\r\\nto the nearest Italian garrison. Turkey agrees to stop supplies and\\r\\ncommunication with these officers if they do not obey the order to\\r\\nsurrender.\\r\\n\\r\\n16. The surrender of all garrisons in Hedjaz, Assir, Yemen, Syria and\\r\\nMesopotamia to the nearest Allied commander, and withdrawal of Turkish\\r\\ntroops from Cilicia, except those necessary to maintain order, as will\\r\\nbe determined under Clause 6.\\r\\n\\r\\n17. The use of all ships and repair facilities at all Turkish ports and\\r\\narsenals.\\r\\n\\r\\n18. The surrender of all ports occupied in Tripolitania and Cyrenaica,\\r\\nincluding Mizurata, to the nearest Allied garrison.\\r\\n\\r\\n19. All Germans and Austrians, naval, military or civilian, to be\\r\\nevacuated within one month from Turkish dominions, and those in remote\\r\\ndistricts as soon after that time as may be possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n20. Compliance with such orders as may be conveyed for the disposal of\\r\\nequipment, arms and ammunition, including the transport of that portion\\r\\nof the Turkish army which is demobilized under Clause 5.\\r\\n\\r\\n21.

Hostilities between the Allies and Turkey shall cease from noon,\\r\\nlocal time, Thursday, the 31st of October, 1918.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE AUSTRIAN AGREEMENT\\r\\nMilitary Clauses\\r\\n\\r\\n1. The immediate cessation of hostilities by land, sea and air.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Total demobilization of the Austro-Hungarian army and immediate\\r\\nwithdrawal of all Austro-Hungarian forces operating on the front from\\r\\nthe North Sea to Switzerland. Within Austro-Hungarian territory, limited\\r\\nas in Clause 3 below, there shall only be maintained as an organized\\r\\nmilitary force reduced to pre-war effectiveness. Half the divisional,\\r\\ncorps and army artillery and equipment shall be collected at points to\\r\\nbe indicated by the Allies and United States of America for delivery to\\r\\nthem, beginning with all such material as exists in the territories to\\r\\nbe evacuated by the Austro-Hungarian forces.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Evacuation of all territories invaded by Austro-Hungary since the\\r\\nbeginning of the war. Withdrawal within such periods as shall be\\r\\ndetermined by the commander-in-chief of the Allied forces on each front\\r\\nof the Austro-Hungarian armies behind a line fixed as follows:--\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Pic Umbrail to the north of the Stelivo it will follow the crest of\\r\\nthe Rhetian Alps up to the sources of the Adige and the Eisaeh, passing\\r\\nthence by Mounts Reschen and Brenner and the heights of Oetz and\\r\\nZoaller. The line thence turns south, crossing Mount Toblach and meeting\\r\\nthe present frontier Carnic Alps. It follows this frontier up to Mount\\r\\nTarvis and after Mount Tarvis the watershed of the Julian Alps by the\\r\\nCol of Predil, Mount Mangart, the Terglou and the watershed of the Cols\\r\\ndi Podberdo, Podlaniscam and Idria. From this point the line turns\\r\\nsoutheast towards the Schneeberg, excludes the whole basin of the Save\\r\\nand its tributaries.

This armistice to be accepted or refused by Germany within\\r\\nseventy-two hours of notification.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER LIV\\r\\n\\r\\nPEACE AT LAST\\r\\n\\r\\nWar came upon the world in August, 1914, with a suddenness and an impact\\r\\nthat dazed the world. When it seemed, in 1918, that mankind had\\r\\nhabituated himself to war and that the bloody struggle would continue\\r\\nuntil the actual exhaustion and extinction of the nations involved,\\r\\npeace suddenly appeared. The debacle of the Teutonic alliance was both\\r\\ndramatic and unexpected, except to those who knew how desperate were the\\r\\nconditions in the nations that were battling for autocracy. Bulgaria was\\r\\nfirst to crumble, then Turkey fell, and Austria-Hungary deserted\\r\\nGermany. The Kaiser and his military advisers, left alone, appealed to\\r\\nthe Allies through President Wilson, for an armistice during which peace\\r\\nterms might be negotiated. Prince Maximilian of Baden, a statesman whose\\r\\nliberal ideas were rumored rather than demonstrated, was chosen to open\\r\\nnegotiations. President Wilson, acting in concert with the Allies,\\r\\nreferred Prince Maximilian to Marshal Foch.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile negotiations were pending, a cabled message was received on\\r\\nNovember 7th to the effect that the armistice had been signed and that\\r\\nall soldiers would cease fighting on two o\\'clock of that afternoon. It\\r\\nwas a false report, but it spread with incredible speed throughout the\\r\\ncountry. Celebrations which included virtually every American, made the\\r\\ncountry a gala place for twenty-four hours. The American people with\\r\\ncharacteristic good nature laughed at the hoax next day and settled down\\r\\nin patience to await the inevitable declaration of an armistice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe true report arrived about three o\\'clock, Eastern time, in the\\r\\nmorning of November 11th. Shrieks of whistles, the booming of cannon,\\r\\nand the clangor of bells, awoke millions of sleeping persons, many of\\r\\nwhom trooped into the streets to mingle their rejoicings with those of\\r\\ntheir neighbors. For a day there was high carnival in town and country\\r\\nthroughout the land, then the nation settled down to face the imminent\\r\\nproblems of reconstruction.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of these had to do with the immediate reduction of governmental\\r\\nexpenditures during the approaching year. President Wilson had appealed\\r\\nto the voters to elect a Democratic Congress as an evidence of approval\\r\\nfor his administration. The reply was a Republican House of\\r\\nRepresentatives and a Republican Senate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Congress that had been in continuous session since America entered\\r\\nthe war, ended its labors in mid-November.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor length, bulk of appropriations for the war and the number and\\r\\nimportance of legislative measures passed, the session was\\r\\nunprecedented.\\r\\n\\r\\nAppropriations passed aggregated $36,298,000,000, making the total for\\r\\nthis Congress more than $45,000,000,000, of which $19,412,000,000 was\\r\\nappropriated at the first (an extra) session, at which war was declared\\r\\non Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\nLegislation passed included bills authorizing billions of Liberty bonds;\\r\\ncreation of the War Finance Corporation; government control of\\r\\ntelegraphs, telephones and cables; executive reorganization of\\r\\ngovernment agencies, and extensions of the espionage act and the army\\r\\ndraft law by which men between eighteen and forty-five years of age were\\r\\nrequired to register.\\r\\n\\r\\nProhibition and woman suffrage furnished sharp controversies throughout\\r\\nthe session. The war-time \"dry\" measure was completed, but after the\\r\\nwoman suffrage constitutional amendment resolution had been adopted,\\r\\nJanuary 10th, by the House, it was defeated in the Senate by two votes.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery man, woman and child in the belligerent nations owed almost seven\\r\\ntimes as much money when peace came as he did at the beginning of the\\r\\nwar.\\r\\n\\r\\nFigures of the war\\'s cost to the world compiled by the Federal Reserve\\r\\nBoard were summarized in the statement that the approximate public debt\\r\\nper capita had increased from $60 before the war to almost $400 at the\\r\\nend of July, 1918. To this was added the cost since July, which is at\\r\\nthe highest rate of the entire period.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe direct cost of the war was calculated by the board at somewhere\\r\\nbetween $170,000,000,000 and $180,000,000,000, not taking into account\\r\\nthe authorization of the debt or the cost of indemnities.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour-fifths of the huge burden fell upon the shoulders of the future,\\r\\nonly Great Britain and America absorbing a considerable amount by\\r\\ntaxation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total debt of the seven principal belligerents before the war did\\r\\nnot exceed $25,000,000,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe board contrasted these figures with the total value of the gold and\\r\\nsilver extracted from the earth since the beginning of the world, which,\\r\\nit said, hardly exceeded $30,000,000,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe belligerent nations, therefore, owed about six times the amount of\\r\\nall the gold and silver produced in all time.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrices rose to three times the average of what they were at the\\r\\nbeginning of the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nGreat Britain\\'s debt increased almost ten times over in the period of\\r\\nthe war, or from $3,580,000,000 to $32,450,000,000 down to June, 1918.\\r\\nThese figures do not include the debts of Australia, Canada, New Zealand\\r\\nand South Africa, British colonies.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrance\\'s debt was quadrupled by the beginning of 1918, increasing from\\r\\n$6,833,000,000 to $25,410,000,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nItaly\\'s debt rose from $2,929,000,000 to $6,918,000,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nFigures for Russia were brought up only to September, 1917, but they\\r\\nshowed that at that time she owed $26,287,000,000, as compared with\\r\\n$5,234,000,000 at the beginning of the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe public debt of the United States was calculated to January 1, 1918,\\r\\nin order to be in line with those of other countries, increasing by that\\r\\ndate to over $8,000,000,000 from a pre-war figure of a billion and a\\r\\nquarter. Since that time $11,500,000,000 have been subscribed to the\\r\\nLiberty Loans, thus increasing the national debt about sixteen fold.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most extraordinary increase of all was that of Germany, rising from\\r\\n$1,208,000,000 to $26,332,000,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nAustria owed $2,736,000,000 at the beginning of the war, which was\\r\\nincreased by June, 1917, to $11,573,000,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nHungary increased her debt from $1,392,000,000 to $5,910,000,000 by\\r\\nDecember, 1917.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neutrals, Denmark, Spain, Holland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland\\r\\ntogether owed $2,871,000,000 when war began and increased their debts\\r\\nonly to $3,710,000,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nExisting war obligations of the United States at the close of 1918\\r\\nmatured as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst Liberty Loan, $2,000,000,000, redeemable at the option of the\\r\\nTreasury after 1932 and payable not later than 1947; Second Liberty\\r\\nLoan, $3,808,000,000, redeemable after 1927, payable in 1942; Third\\r\\nLiberty Loan, $4,176,000,000, redeemable and payable without option in\\r\\n1928; Fourth Liberty Loan, $6,989,047,000, redeemable after 1933,\\r\\npayable in 1938; War Savings, $879,300,000 up to November, 1918, payable\\r\\nin 1923.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this program of maturity, the Treasury by exercising its option\\r\\ncould call in the nation\\'s war debt for redemption in installments every\\r\\nfive years until 1947.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecretary of the Treasury, William Gibbs McAdoo, who was also Director\\r\\nGeneral of Transportation, created a sensation when he resigned both\\r\\noffices in November, 1918, the resignation to take effect January 1,\\r\\n1919. Coming upon the eve of the peace conference in Paris and the\\r\\nannouncement that President Wilson intended to head the American\\r\\ndelegates to the conference, the resignation caused widespread surprise.\\r\\nThe reasons given by Mr. McAdoo were ill-health and a serious\\r\\ndepreciation of his private fortune during his incumbency of\\r\\ngovernmental positions.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the armistice, steps were immediately taken for the\\r\\nrepatriation of a considerable portion of the American forces in France\\r\\nand the return to their homes of the men in American training camps. The\\r\\nThird Army of the United States, commanded by General Dickman, was\\r\\nordered to the western shore of the Rhine, there to co-operate with the\\r\\ntroops of the Allies until the conclusion of peace negotiations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe country was amazed on November 23d when General March announced that\\r\\nthe casualties of the American forces which had been anticipated as\\r\\nbeing less than 100,000, had in reality exceeded 236,000. Explanation\\r\\nfor this lay in the fierce on-rush of the American forces during the\\r\\nlast month of the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nA forecast that many thousands of American boys would remain in France\\r\\nwas given by Andre Tardieu, General Commissioner for Franco-American\\r\\naffairs, when addressing the Association of Foreign Correspondents in\\r\\nNew York City, after the armistice had been signed.\\r\\n\\r\\nM. Tardieu appealed for permission to retain American soldiers in\\r\\nFrance. He said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We want first an immediate assistance in the matter of labor. We hope\\r\\nthat, during the preparation and the carrying out of the transportation\\r\\nof your troops back to America your technical units as well as other\\r\\nunits with their equipment will be able to co-operate in that effort. We\\r\\nsoon will have to carry out a colossal work of transportation in view of\\r\\nthe supplying of the regions evacuated by the enemy, of the recovering\\r\\nof the railroads in Northern and Eastern France and in Alsace-Lorraine.\\r\\nWe will have to clean the reconquered ground of the ruins accumulated by\\r\\nthe German hordes. Your army will help us in this work while our\\r\\npopulation will restore her cities and villages.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Again in reference, not to all purchases--as a large part of our needs\\r\\nwill be supplied outside of the United States--but in reference to those\\r\\npurchases which will be made in America, we are in need of credits in\\r\\ndollars covering about fifty per cent of our total purchases for\\r\\nreconstruction. The assurance of that financial help will bring to every\\r\\none in France, government and private enterprise, the courage and faith\\r\\nnecessary to apply to peace reconstruction the energy and the spirit of\\r\\nenterprise she has so prominently shown during the war.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We will exact from Germany the restitution of each part of the material\\r\\ntaken away from us as can be recovered. But, besides that restitution,\\r\\nwe must bear in mind that speed is a primary condition in the\\r\\nreconstruction of France, and that America, on account of her immense\\r\\ncapacities for production, ought to give us the first help. We need\\r\\nships, chartered ships as well as ships transferred to our flag; the\\r\\nspeedy reconstruction of the country is strictly depending on the\\r\\nrevival of our mercantile fleet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The colossal effort put up by the United States in the building of her\\r\\nfleet for war purposes will not be diverted from this sacred end if it,\\r\\nin part, helps France to recover on the seas, for the revival of her\\r\\nforces in peace, the means of transportation which were lost to her on\\r\\naccount of the war.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In reference to these four items--labor; credit, raw materials,\\r\\nships--I have explained in detail our needs to your administration, by\\r\\nwhose welcome I have been deeply moved. What I told them, what I asked\\r\\nfor, I am telling it to you again, because a policy of secrecy does not\\r\\nbefit our day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have lost two million and a half men; some are dead, some maimed,\\r\\nsome have returned sick and incapacitated from German prisons. Whether\\r\\nthey be lost altogether, or whether their working capacity be\\r\\npermanently reduced, they will not participate in this reconstruction.\\r\\nThe fifteenth part of our people is missing at the very time we need all\\r\\nour material and moral forces in order to build up our life again. The\\r\\nyounger part, yea, the stronger part of our nation, the flower of\\r\\nFrance, has died away on the battle-fields. Our country has been bereft\\r\\nof its most precious resources.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Our war expenses, on the other side, 120,000,000,000 francs, are\\r\\nweighing heavily on our shoulders. To payoff this debt there are at hand\\r\\nonly such limited resources as invasion has left us. The territories\\r\\nwhich have been under German occupation for four years were the\\r\\nwealthiest part of France. Their area did not exceed six per cent of the\\r\\nwhole country. They paid, however, twenty-five per cent of the sum total\\r\\nof our taxes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These territories which have been, for the last three months, occupied\\r\\nagain by us at the cost of our own blood and of the blood of our allies,\\r\\nare now in a state of ruin even worse than we had anticipated. Of the\\r\\ncities and villages nothing remains but ruins; 350,000 homes have been\\r\\ndestroyed. To build them up again--I am referring to the building\\r\\nproper, without the furnishings--600 million days\\' of work will be\\r\\nnecessary, involving, together with building material, an outlay of\\r\\n10,000,000,000 francs. As regards personal property of every description\\r\\neither destroyed by battle, or stolen by the Germans, there stands an\\r\\nadditional loss of at least 4,000,000,000 francs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This valuation of lost personal property does not include--as definite\\r\\nfigures are lacking as yet--the countless war contributions and fines by\\r\\nthe enemy, amounting also to billions. I need hardly say that, in those\\r\\nwealthy lands, practically no agricultural resources are left.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The losses in horses and in cattle, bovine and ovine species, hogs,\\r\\ngoats, amount to 1,510,000 head--in agricultural equipment to 454,000\\r\\nmachines or carts--the two items worth together 6,000,000,000 francs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now as regards industries, the disaster is even more complete. These\\r\\ndistricts occupied by the Germans and whose machinery has been\\r\\nmethodically destroyed or taken away by the enemy, were, industrially\\r\\nspeaking, the very heart of France. They were the very backbone of our\\r\\nproduction, as shown in the following startling figures:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In 1913 the wool output of our invaded regions amounted to 94 per cent\\r\\nof the total. French production and corresponding figures were: For flax\\r\\nfrom the spinning mills, 90 per cent; iron ore, 90 per cent; pig iron,\\r\\n83 per cent; steel, 70 per cent; sugar, 70 per cent; cotton, 60 per\\r\\ncent; coal 55 per cent; electric power, 45 per cent. Of all that,\\r\\nplants, machinery, mines, nothing is left. Everything has been carried\\r\\naway or destroyed by the enemy. So complete is the destruction that, in\\r\\nthe case of our great coal mines in the north, two years of work will be\\r\\nneeded before a single ton of coal can be extracted and ten years before\\r\\nthe output is brought back to the figures of 1913.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All that must be rebuilt, and to carry out that kind of reconstruction\\r\\nonly, there will be a need of over 2,000,000 tons of pig iron, nearly\\r\\n4,000,000 tons of steel--not to mention the replenishing of stocks and\\r\\nof raw materials which must of necessity be supplied to the plants\\r\\nduring the first year of resumed activity. If we take into account these\\r\\ndifferent items we reach as regards industrial needs a total of\\r\\n25,000,000,000 francs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To resurrect these regions, to reconstruct these factories, raw\\r\\nmaterials are not now sufficient; we need means of transportation. Now\\r\\nthe enemy has destroyed our railroad tracks, our railroad equipment, and\\r\\nour rolling stock, which in the first month of the war, in 1914, was\\r\\nreduced by 50,000 cars, has undergone the wear and tear of fifty months\\r\\nof war.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Our merchant fleet, on the other hand, has lost more than a million\\r\\ntons through submarine warfare. Our shipyards during the last four years\\r\\nhave not built any ships. For they have produced for us and for our\\r\\nallies cannon, ammunition, and tanks. Here, again, for this item alone\\r\\nof means of transportation we must figure on an expense of 2,500,000,000\\r\\nfrancs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This makes, if I sum up these different items, a need of raw material\\r\\nwhich represents in cost, at the present rate of prices in France, not\\r\\nless than 50,000,000,000 francs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And this formidable figure, gentlemen, does not cover everything. I\\r\\nhave not taken into account the loss represented for the future\\r\\nproduction of France by the transformation of so many factories which\\r\\nfor four years were exclusively devoted to war munitions. I have not\\r\\ntaken into account foreign markets lost to us as a result of the\\r\\ndestruction of one-fourth of our productive capital and the almost total\\r\\ncollapse of our trade. I have not taken into account the economic\\r\\nweakening that we will suffer tomorrow owing to that loss, to which I\\r\\nreferred a while ago, of 2,500,000 young an vigorous men.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was one of the great by-products of the war. Thousands of young\\r\\nAmericans, vigorous evangels of democratic thought, remained in Europe\\r\\nto bring American ideals and American force into the affairs of the old\\r\\nworld.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who returned were formidable factors in re-shaping the affairs of\\r\\nthe nation. Grave injustices were done in some instances to young men\\r\\nwho had volunteered in the early days of the war through patriotic\\r\\nmotives and who returned to find their places in industry taken by\\r\\nothers. In the main, however, the process of absorption went forward\\r\\nsteadily and without serious incident.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne factor making for satisfactory adjustment was the insurance system\\r\\nput into effect by the United States Government, affecting its war\\r\\nforces. Immediately following the armistice, the following announcement\\r\\nwas made:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPreparations by the government for re-insuring the lives of soldiers and\\r\\nsailors on their return have been hastened by the signing of the\\r\\narmistice. Although regulations have not yet been fully drafted, it is\\r\\ncertain that each of the 4,250,000 men in the military or naval service\\r\\nnow holding voluntary government insurance will be permitted within five\\r\\nyears after peace is declared to convert it without further medical\\r\\nexamination into ordinary life, twenty-pay life, endowment maturing at\\r\\nthe age of sixty-two, or other prescribed forms of insurance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis insurance will be arranged by the government, not by private\\r\\ncompanies, and the cost is expected to be at least one-fourth less than\\r\\nsimilar forms offered by private agencies. The low cost will result from\\r\\nthe fact that the government will pay all overhead administration\\r\\nexpenses, which, for private companies, amount to about seventeen per\\r\\ncent of premium receipts; will save the usual solicitation fees and, in\\r\\naddition, bear the risk resulting from the wounding or weakening of men\\r\\nwhile in the service. Private companies would not write insurance on\\r\\nmany wounded men, or their rates would be unusually high.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government will arrange to collect premiums monthly, if men wish to\\r\\npay that way, or for longer periods in advance. This may be done through\\r\\npost-offices. The minimum amount of insurance to be issued probably will\\r\\nbe $1,000, and the maximum $10,000, with any amount between those sums\\r\\nin multiple of $500. There will be provision for payments in case of\\r\\ndisability as well as death, according to the tentative plan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus will be created out of the government\\'s emergency war insurance\\r\\nbureau the greatest life insurance institution in the world for peace\\r\\ntimes, with more policyholders and greater aggregate risks than a half\\r\\ndozen of the world\\'s biggest private companies combined. Out of the\\r\\nexperience gained may eventually develop expansion of government\\r\\ninsurance to old age, industrial and other forms of insurance, in the\\r\\nopinion of officials who have studied the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegulations for reinsuring returning soldiers and sailors are being\\r\\nframed by an advisory board to the military and naval section of the war\\r\\nrisk bureau, consisting of Arthur Hunter, actuary of the New York Life\\r\\nInsurance Company; W. A. Fraser, Omaha, of the Woodmen of the World, and\\r\\nF. Robertson Jones, of the Workmen\\'s Compensation Publicity Bureau, New\\r\\nYork.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlans also are under consideration for allowing beneficiaries of men who\\r\\nhave died or been killed in the service to choose between taking monthly\\r\\npayments over a period of twenty years or to commute these payments in a\\r\\nlump sum.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER LV\\r\\n\\r\\nAMERICA\\'S POSITION IN WAR AND PEACE\\r\\n\\r\\nBy common consent of the Entente Allies, President Wilson was made the\\r\\nspokesman for the democracy of the world. As Lloyd George, Premier\\r\\nClemenceau of France, Premier Orlando of Italy, and other Europeans\\r\\nrecognized, his utterances most clearly and cogently expressed the\\r\\nprinciples for which civilization was battling against the Hun. More\\r\\nthan that, these statesmen and the peoples they represented recognized\\r\\nthat back of President Wilson were the high ideals of an America pledged\\r\\nto the redemption of a war-weary world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe war produced a sterility in literature. Out of the great mass that\\r\\nwas written, however, two productions stood out in their nobility of\\r\\nthought and in their classic directness of expression. These were the\\r\\naddress before Congress by President Wilson on the night of April 2,\\r\\n1917, when, recognizing fully the dread responsibility of his action, he\\r\\npronounced the words which led America into the World War, and the\\r\\nspeech made by him on Monday, November 11, 1918, when addressing\\r\\nCongress he announced the end of the war. Other declarations of the\\r\\nPresident that will be treasured as long as democracy survives, are\\r\\nthose enunciating the fourteen points upon which America would make\\r\\npeace, and two later declarations as to America\\'s purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis address of April 2d was delivered before the most distinguished\\r\\nassemblage ever gathered within the hall of the House of\\r\\nRepresentatives. The Supreme Court of the United States, headed by the\\r\\nChief Justice, every member of the embassies then resident in\\r\\nWashington, the entire membership of the House and Senate, and a host of\\r\\nthe most distinguished men and women that could crowd themselves into\\r\\nthe great hall, listened to what was virtually America\\'s Declaration of\\r\\nWar.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe air was still and tragic suspense was upon every face as the\\r\\nPresident began his address. At first he was pale as the marble rostrum\\r\\nagainst which he leaned. As he read from small sheets typewritten with\\r\\nhis own hand, his voice grew firmer and the flush of indignation and of\\r\\nresolution overspread his countenance. He said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:\\r\\n\\r\\nI have called the Congress into extraordinary session because there are\\r\\nserious, very serious, choices of policy to be made, and made\\r\\nimmediately, which it was neither right nor constitutionally permissible\\r\\nthat I should assume the responsibility of making.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the third of February last I officially laid before you the\\r\\nextraordinary announcement of the Imperial German Government that on and\\r\\nafter the first day of February it was its purpose to put aside all\\r\\nrestraints of law or of humanity and use its submarines to sink every\\r\\nvessel that sought to approach either the ports of Great Britain and\\r\\nIreland on the western coasts of Europe or any of the ports controlled\\r\\nby the enemies of Germany within the Mediterranean. That had seemed to\\r\\nbe the object of the German submarine warfare earlier in the war, but\\r\\nsince April of last year the Imperial Government had somewhat restrained\\r\\nthe commanders of its undersea craft in conformity with its promise then\\r\\ngiven to us that passenger boats should not be sunk and that due warning\\r\\nwould be given to all other vessels which its submarines might seek to\\r\\ndestroy, when no resistance was offered or escape attempted, and care\\r\\ntaken that their crews were given at least a fair chance to save their\\r\\nlives in their open boats. The precautions taken were meager and\\r\\nhaphazard enough, as was proved in distressing instance after instance\\r\\nin the progress of the cruel and unmanly business, but a certain degree\\r\\nof restraint was observed. The new policy has swept every restriction\\r\\naside. Vessels of every kind, whatever their flag, their character,\\r\\ntheir cargo, their destination, their errand, have been ruthlessly sent\\r\\nto the bottom without warning and without thought of help or mercy for\\r\\nthose on board, the vessels of friendly neutrals along with those of\\r\\nbelligerents. Even hospital ships and ships carrying relief to the\\r\\nsorely bereaved and stricken people of Belgium, though the latter were\\r\\nprovided with safe conduct through the proscribed areas by the German\\r\\nGovernment itself and were distinguished by unmistakable marks of\\r\\nidentity, have been sunk with the same reckless lack of compassion or of\\r\\nprinciple.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was for a little while unable to believe that such things would in\\r\\nfact be done by any government that had hitherto subscribed to the\\r\\nhumane practices of civilized nations. International law had its origin\\r\\nin the attempt to set up some law which would be respected and observed\\r\\nupon the seas, where no nation had right of dominion and where lay the\\r\\nfree highways of the world. By painful stage after stage has that law\\r\\nbeen built up, with meager enough results, indeed, after all was\\r\\naccomplished that could be accomplished, but always with a clear view,\\r\\nat least, of what the heart and conscience of mankind demanded.  This\\r\\nminimum of right the German Government has swept aside under the plea of\\r\\nretaliation and necessity and because it had no weapons which it could\\r\\nuse at sea except these which it is impossible to employ as it is\\r\\nemploying them without throwing to the winds all scruples of humanity or\\r\\nof respect for the understandings that were supposed to underlie the\\r\\nintercourse of the world. I am not now thinking of the loss of property\\r\\ninvolved, immense and serious as that is, but only of the wanton and\\r\\nwholesale destruction of the lives of noncombatants, men, women, and\\r\\nchildren, engaged in pursuits which have always, even in the darkest\\r\\nperiods of modern history, been deemed innocent and legitimate. Property\\r\\ncan be paid for; the lives of peaceful and innocent people can not be.\\r\\nThe present German submarine warfare against commerce is a warfare\\r\\nagainst mankind.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a war against all nations: American ships have been sunk, American\\r\\nlives taken, in ways which it has stirred us very deeply to learn of,\\r\\nbut the ships and people of other neutral and friendly nations have been\\r\\nsunk and overwhelmed in the waters in the same way. There has been no\\r\\ndiscrimination. The challenge is to all mankind. Each nation must decide\\r\\nfor itself how it will meet it. The choice we make for ourselves must be\\r\\nmade with a moderation of counsel and a temperateness of judgment\\r\\nbefitting our character and our motives as a nation. We must put excited\\r\\nfeeling away. Our motive will not be revenge or the victorious assertion\\r\\nof the physical might of the nation, but only the vindication of right,\\r\\nof human right, of which we are only a single champion.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I addressed the Congress on the twenty-sixth of February last I\\r\\nthought that it would suffice to assert our neutral rights with arms,\\r\\nour right to use the seas against unlawful interference, our right to\\r\\nkeep our people safe against unlawful violence. But armed neutrality, it\\r\\nnow appears, is impracticable. Because submarines are in effect outlaws\\r\\nwhen used as the German submarines have been used against merchant\\r\\nshipping, it is impossible to defend ships against their attacks as the\\r\\nlaw of nations has assumed that merchantmen would defend themselves\\r\\nagainst privateers or cruisers, visible craft giving chase upon the open\\r\\nsea. It is common prudence in such circumstances, grim necessity indeed,\\r\\nto endeavor to destroy them before they have shown their own intention.\\r\\nThey must be dealt with upon sight, if dealt with at all. The German\\r\\nGovernment denies the right of neutrals to use arms at all within the\\r\\nareas of the sea which it has proscribed, even in the defense of rights\\r\\nwhich no modern publicist has ever before questioned their right to\\r\\ndefend. The intimation is conveyed that the armed guards which we have\\r\\nplaced on our merchant ships will be treated as beyond the pale of law\\r\\nand subject to be dealt with as pirates would be. Armed neutrality is\\r\\nineffectual enough at best; in such circumstances and in the face of\\r\\nsuch pretensions it is worse than ineffectual: it is likely only to\\r\\nproduce what it was meant to prevent; it is practically certain to draw\\r\\nus into the war without either the rights or the effectiveness of\\r\\nbelligerents. There is one choice we can not make, we are incapable of\\r\\nmaking; we will not choose the path of submission and suffer the most\\r\\nsacred rights of our nation and our people to be ignored or violated.\\r\\nThe wrongs against which we now array ourselves are no common wrongs;\\r\\nthey cut to the very roots of human life.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a profound sense of the solemn and even tragical character of the\\r\\nstep I am taking and of the grave responsibilities which it involves,\\r\\nbut in unhesitating obedience to what I deem my constitutional duty, I\\r\\nadvise that the Congress declare the recent course of the Imperial\\r\\nGerman Government to be in fact nothing less than war against the\\r\\ngovernment and people of the United States; that it formally accept the\\r\\nstatus of belligerent which has thus been thrust upon it; and that it\\r\\ntake immediate steps not only to put the country in a more thorough\\r\\nstate of defense but also to exert all its power and employ all its\\r\\nresources to bring the Government of the German Empire to terms and end\\r\\nthe war.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat this will involve is clear. It will involve the utmost practicable\\r\\nco-operation in counsel and action with the governments now at war with\\r\\nGermany, and, as incident to that, the extension to those governments of\\r\\nthe most liberal financial credits, in order that our resources may so\\r\\nfar as possible be added to theirs. It will involve the organization and\\r\\nmobilization of all the material resources of the country to supply the\\r\\nmaterials of war and serve the incidental needs of the nation in the\\r\\nmost abundant and yet the most economical and efficient way possible. It\\r\\nwill involve the immediate full equipment of the navy in all respects\\r\\nbut particularly in supplying it with the best means of dealing with the\\r\\nenemy\\'s submarines. It will involve the immediate addition to the armed\\r\\nforces of the United States already provided for by law in case of war\\r\\nat least five hundred thousand men, who should, in my opinion, be chosen\\r\\nupon the principle of universal liability to service, and also the\\r\\nauthorization of subsequent additional increments of equal force so soon\\r\\nas they may be needed and can be handled in training. It will involve\\r\\nalso, of course, the granting of adequate credits to the Government,\\r\\nsustained, I hope, so far as they can equitably be sustained by the\\r\\npresent generation, by well conceived taxation.\\r\\n\\r\\nI say sustained so far as may be equitable by taxation because it seems\\r\\nto me that it would be most unwise to base the credits which will now be\\r\\nnecessary entirely on money borrowed. It is our duty, I most\\r\\nrespectfully urge, to protect our people so far as we may against the\\r\\nvery serious hardships and evils which would be likely to arise out of\\r\\nthe inflation which would be produced by vast loans.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn carrying out the measures by which these things are to be\\r\\naccomplished we should keep constantly in mind the wisdom of interfering\\r\\nas little as possible in our own preparation and in the equipment of our\\r\\nown military forces with the duty--for it will be a very practical\\r\\nduty--of supplying the nations already at war with Germany with the\\r\\nmaterials which they can obtain only from us or by our assistance. They\\r\\nare in the field and we should help them in every way to be effective\\r\\nthere.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph]\\r\\n  British Official Photograph\\r\\n  BELGIAN SOVEREIGNS RE-ENTER BRUGES\\r\\n  King Albert and Queen Elizabeth of Belgium saluting the Allied colors,\\r\\n  on their triumphal entry into Bruges at the head of their victorious\\r\\n  army, October 23, 1918.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph]\\r\\n  Copyright International Film Service.\\r\\n  SURRENDER OF THE GERMAN HIGH SEAS FLEET\\r\\n  Actual photograph showing the greatest naval surrender in history--the\\r\\n  German fleet arriving to surrender. Below, The commanders of the\\r\\n  British and American fleets, Admirals Beatty and Rodman, the King of\\r\\n  England and the Prince of Wales viewing the surrender.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall take the liberty of suggesting, through the several executive\\r\\ndepartments of the Government, for the consideration of your committees,\\r\\nmeasures for the accomplishment of the several objects I have mentioned.\\r\\nI hope that it will be your pleasure to deal with them as having been\\r\\nframed after very careful thought by the branch of the Government upon\\r\\nwhich the responsibility of conducting the war and safeguarding the\\r\\nnation will most directly fall.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we do these things, these deeply momentous things, let us be very\\r\\nclear, and make very clear to all the world what our motives and our\\r\\nobjects are. My own thought has not been driven from its habitual and\\r\\nnormal course by the unhappy events of the last two months, and I do not\\r\\nbelieve that the thought of the nation has been altered or clouded by\\r\\nthem. I have exactly the same things in mind now that I had in mind when\\r\\nI addressed the Senate on the 22d of January last; the same that I had\\r\\nin mind when I addressed the Congress on the 3d of February and on the\\r\\n26th of February. Our object now, as then, is to vindicate the\\r\\nprinciples of peace and justice in the life of the world as against\\r\\nselfish and autocratic power and to set up amongst the really free and\\r\\nself-governed peoples of the world such a concert of purpose and of\\r\\naction as will henceforth ensure the observance of those principles.\\r\\nNeutrality is no longer feasible or desirable where the peace of the\\r\\nworld is involved and the freedom of its peoples, and the menace to that\\r\\npeace and freedom lies in the existence of autocratic governments backed\\r\\nby organized force which is controlled wholly by their will, not by the\\r\\nwill of their people. We have seen the last of neutrality in such\\r\\ncircumstances. We are at the beginning of an age in which it will be\\r\\ninsisted that the same standards of conduct and of responsibility for\\r\\nwrong done shall be observed among nations and their governments that\\r\\nare observed among the individual citizens of civilized states.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have no quarrel with the German people. We have no feeling towards\\r\\nthem but one of sympathy and friendship. It was not upon their impulse\\r\\nthat their government acted in entering this war. It was not with their\\r\\nprevious knowledge or approval. It was a war determined upon as wars\\r\\nused to be determined upon in the old, unhappy days when peoples were\\r\\nnowhere consulted by their rulers and wars were provoked and waged in\\r\\nthe interest of dynasties or of little groups of ambitious men who were\\r\\naccustomed to use their fellow men as pawns and tools. Self-governed\\r\\nnations do not fill their neighbor states with spies or set the course\\r\\nof intrigue to bring about some critical posture of affairs which will\\r\\ngive them an opportunity to strike and make conquest. Such designs can\\r\\nbe successfully worked out only under cover and where no one has the\\r\\nright to ask questions. Cunningly contrived plans of deception or\\r\\naggression, carried, it may be, from generation to generation, can be\\r\\nworked out and kept from the light only within the privacy of courts or\\r\\nbehind the carefully guarded confidences of a narrow and privileged\\r\\nclass. They are happily impossible where public opinion commands and\\r\\ninsists upon full information concerning all the nation\\'s affairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nA steadfast concert for peace can never be maintained except by a\\r\\npartnership of democratic nations. No autocratic government could be\\r\\ntrusted to keep faith within it or observe its covenants. It must be a\\r\\nleague of honor, a partnership of opinion. Intrigue would eat its vitals\\r\\naway; the plottings of inner circles who could plan what they would and\\r\\nrender account to no one would be a corruption seated at its very heart.\\r\\nOnly free peoples can hold their purpose and their honor steady to a\\r\\ncommon end and prefer the interests of mankind to any narrow interest of\\r\\ntheir own.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes not every American feel that assurance has been added to our hope\\r\\nfor the future peace of the world by the wonderful and heartening things\\r\\nthat have been happening within the last few weeks in Russia? Russia was\\r\\nknown by those who knew it best to have been always in fact democratic\\r\\nat heart, in all the vital habits of her thoughts, in all the intimate\\r\\nrelationships of her people that spoke their natural instinct, their\\r\\nhabitual attitude towards life. The autocracy that crowned the summit of\\r\\nher political structure, long as it had stood and terrible as was the\\r\\nreality of its power, was not in fact Russian in origin, character, or\\r\\npurpose; and now it has been shaken off and the great, generous Russian\\r\\npeople have been added in all their native majesty and might to the\\r\\nforces that are fighting for freedom in the world, for justice, and for\\r\\npeace. Here is a fit partner for a League of Honor.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the things that has served to convince us that the Prussian\\r\\nautocracy was not and could never be our friend is that from the very\\r\\noutset of the present war it has filled our unsuspecting communities and\\r\\neven our offices of government with spies and set criminal intrigues\\r\\neverywhere afoot against our national unity of counsel, our peace within\\r\\nand without, our industries and our commerce. Indeed it is now evident\\r\\nthat its spies were here even before the war began; and it is unhappily\\r\\nnot a matter of conjecture but a fact proved in our courts of justice\\r\\nthat the intrigues which have more than once come perilously near to\\r\\ndisturbing the peace and dislocating the industries of the country have\\r\\nbeen carried on at the instigation, with the support, and even under the\\r\\npersonal direction of official agents of the Imperial Government\\r\\naccredited to the Government of the United States. Even in checking\\r\\nthese things and trying to extirpate them we have sought to put the most\\r\\ngenerous interpretation possible upon them because we knew that their\\r\\nsource lay, not in any hostile feeling or purpose of the German people\\r\\ntowards us (who were, no doubt as ignorant of them as we ourselves\\r\\nwere), but only in the selfish designs of a government that did what it\\r\\npleased and told its people nothing. But they have played their part in\\r\\nserving to convince us at last that that government entertains no real\\r\\nfriendship for us and means to act against our peace and security at its\\r\\nconvenience. That it means to stir up enemies against us at our very\\r\\ndoors the intercepted note to the German Minister at Mexico City is\\r\\neloquent evidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are accepting this challenge of hostile purpose because we know that\\r\\nin such a government, following such methods, we can never have a\\r\\nfriend; and that in the presence of its organized power, always lying in\\r\\nwait to accomplish we know not what purpose, there can be no assured\\r\\nsecurity for the democratic governments of the world. We are now about\\r\\nto accept gauge of battle with this natural foe to liberty and shall, if\\r\\nnecessary, spend the whole force of the nation to check and nullify its\\r\\npretensions and its power. We are glad, now that we see the facts with\\r\\nno veil of false pretense about them, to fight thus for the ultimate\\r\\npeace of the world and for the liberation of its peoples, the German\\r\\npeoples included: for the rights of nations great and small and the\\r\\nprivilege of men everywhere to choose their way of life and of\\r\\nobedience. The world must be made safe for democracy. Its peace must be\\r\\nplanted upon the tested foundations of political liberty. We have no\\r\\nselfish ends to serve. We desire no conquest, no dominion. We seek no\\r\\nindemnities for ourselves, no material compensation for the sacrifices\\r\\nwe shall freely make. We are but one of the champions of the rights of\\r\\nmankind. We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as\\r\\nsecure as the faith and the freedom of nations can make them.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust because we fight without rancor and without selfish object, seeking\\r\\nnothing for ourselves but what we shall wish to share with all free\\r\\npeoples, we shall, I feel confident, conduct our operations as\\r\\nbelligerents without passion, and ourselves observe with proud punctilio\\r\\nthe principles of right and of fair play we profess to be fighting for.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have said nothing of the governments allied with the Imperial\\r\\nGovernment of Germany because they have not made war upon us or\\r\\nchallenged us to defend our right and our honor. The Austro-Hungarian\\r\\nGovernment has, indeed, avowed its unqualified endorsement and\\r\\nacceptance of the reckless and lawless submarine warfare adopted now\\r\\nwithout disguise by the Imperial German Government, and it has therefore\\r\\nnot been possible for this government to receive Count Tarnowski, the\\r\\nAmbassador recently accredited to this government by the Imperial and\\r\\nRoyal Government of Austria-Hungary; but that government has not\\r\\nactually engaged in warfare against citizens of the United States on the\\r\\nseas, and I take the liberty, for the present at least, of postponing a\\r\\ndiscussion of our relations with the authorities at Vienna. We enter\\r\\nthis war only where we are clearly forced into it because there are no\\r\\nother means of defending our rights.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves as belligerents in\\r\\na high spirit of right and fairness because we act without animus, not\\r\\nin enmity towards a people or with the desire to bring any injury or\\r\\ndisadvantage upon them, but only in armed opposition to an irresponsible\\r\\ngovernment which has thrown aside all considerations of humanity and of\\r\\nright and is running amuck. We are, let me say again, the sincere\\r\\nfriends of the German people, and shall desire nothing so much as the\\r\\nearly re-establishment of intimate relations of mutual advantage between\\r\\nus--however hard it may be for them, for the time being, to believe that\\r\\nthis is spoken from our hearts. We have borne with their present\\r\\ngovernment through all these bitter months because of that\\r\\nfriendship--exercising a patience and forbearance which would otherwise\\r\\nhave been impossible. We shall, happily, still have an opportunity to\\r\\nprove that friendship in our daily attitude and actions towards the\\r\\nmillions of men and women of German birth and native sympathy who live\\r\\namongst us and share our life, and we shall be proud to prove it towards\\r\\nall who are in fact loyal to their neighbors and to the government in\\r\\nthe hour of test. They are, most of them, as true and loyal Americans as\\r\\nif they had never known any other fealty or allegiance. They will be\\r\\nprompt to stand with us in rebuking and restraining the few who may be\\r\\nof a different mind and purpose. If there should be disloyalty, it will\\r\\nbe dealt with with a firm hand of stern repression; but, if it lifts its\\r\\nhead at all, it will lift it only here and there and without countenance\\r\\nexcept from a lawless and malignant few.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a distressing and oppressive duty, Gentlemen of the Congress,\\r\\nwhich I have performed in thus addressing you. There are, it may be,\\r\\nmany months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of us. It is a fearful\\r\\nthing to lead this great peaceful people into war, into the most\\r\\nterrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to be\\r\\nin the balance. But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall\\r\\nfight for the things which we have always carried nearest our\\r\\nhearts--for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to\\r\\nhave a voice in their own governments, for the rights and liberties of\\r\\nsmall nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of\\r\\nfree peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the\\r\\nworld itself at last free. To such a task we can dedicate our lives and\\r\\nour fortunes, everything that we are and everything that we have, with\\r\\nthe pride of those who know that the day has come when America is\\r\\nprivileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave\\r\\nher birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured. God\\r\\nhelping her, she can do no other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHis address to Congress on November 11, 1918, while all the Allied\\r\\nNations were celebrating with exultant hearts the victory that had come\\r\\nto them, was no less dramatic than the speech that had marked the\\r\\nbeginning of the war. He prefaced it by reading the drastic terms of the\\r\\narmistice granted to Germany. Continuing he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe war thus comes to an end; for, having accepted these terms of\\r\\narmistice, it will be impossible for the German command to renew it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not now possible to assess the consequences of this great\\r\\nconsummation. We know only that this tragical war, whose consuming\\r\\nflames swept from one nation to another until all the world was on fire,\\r\\nis at an end and that it was the privilege of our own people to enter it\\r\\nat its most critical juncture in such fashion and in such force as to\\r\\ncontribute, in a way of which we are all deeply proud, to the great\\r\\nresult. We know, too, that the object of the war is attained; the object\\r\\nupon which all free men had set their hearts; and attained with a\\r\\nsweeping completeness which even now we do not realize. Armed\\r\\nimperialism such as the men conceived who were but yesterday the masters\\r\\nof Germany is at an end, its illicit ambitions engulfed in black\\r\\ndisaster. Who will now seek to revive it?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe arbitrary power of the military caste of Germany which once could\\r\\nsecretly and of its own single choice disturb the peace of the world is\\r\\ndiscredited and destroyed. And more than that--much more than that--has\\r\\nbeen accomplished. The great nations which associated themselves to\\r\\ndestroy it have now definitely united in the common purpose to set up\\r\\nsuch a peace as will satisfy the longing of the whole world for\\r\\ndisinterested justice, embodied in settlements which are based upon\\r\\nsomething much better and more lasting than the selfish competitive\\r\\ninterests of powerful states. There is no longer conjecture as to the\\r\\nobjects the victors have in mind. They have a mind in the matter, not\\r\\nonly, but a heart also. Their avowed and concerted purpose is to satisfy\\r\\nand protect the weak as well as to accord their just rights to the\\r\\nstrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe humane temper and intention of the victorious governments have\\r\\nalready been manifested in a very practical way. Their representatives\\r\\nin the Supreme War Council at Versailles have by unanimous resolution\\r\\nassured the peoples of the Central Empires that everything that is\\r\\npossible in the circumstances will be done to supply them with food and\\r\\nrelieve the distressing want that is in so many places threatening their\\r\\nvery lives; and steps are to be taken immediately to organize these\\r\\nefforts at relief in the same systematic manner that they were organized\\r\\nin the case of Belgium. By the use of the idle tonnage of the Central\\r\\nEmpires it ought presently to be possible to lift the fear of utter\\r\\nmisery from their oppressed populations and set their minds and energies\\r\\nfree for the great and hazardous tasks of political reconstruction which\\r\\nnow face them on every hand. Hunger does not breed reform; it breeds\\r\\nmadness and all the ugly distempers that make an ordered life\\r\\nimpossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor with the fall of the ancient governments, which rested like an\\r\\nincubus on the peoples of the Central Empires, has come political change\\r\\nnot merely, but revolution; and revolution which seems as yet to assume\\r\\nno final and ordered form, but to run from one fluid change to another,\\r\\nuntil thoughtful men are forced to ask themselves, with what governments\\r\\nand of what sort are we about to deal in the making of the covenants of\\r\\npeace? With what authority will they meet us, and with what assurance\\r\\nthat their authority will abide and sustain securely the international\\r\\narrangements into which we are about to enter? There is here matter for\\r\\nno small anxiety and misgiving. When peace is made, upon whose promises\\r\\nand engagements besides our own is it to rest?\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us be perfectly frank with ourselves and admit that these questions\\r\\ncannot be satisfactorily answered now or at once. But the moral is not\\r\\nthat there is little hope of an early answer that will suffice. It is\\r\\nonly that we must be patient and helpful and mindful above all of the\\r\\ngreat hope and confidence that lie at the heart of what is taking place.\\r\\nExcesses accomplish nothing. Unhappy Russia has furnished abundant\\r\\nrecent proof of that. Disorder immediately defeats itself. If excesses\\r\\nshould occur, if disorder should for a time raise its head, a sober\\r\\nsecond thought will follow and a day of constructive action, if we help\\r\\nand do not hinder.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe present and all that it holds belongs to the nations and the peoples\\r\\nwho preserve their self-control and the orderly processes of their\\r\\ngovernments; the future to those who prove themselves the true friends\\r\\nof mankind. To conquer with arms is to make only a temporary conquest;\\r\\nto conquer the world by earning its esteem is to make permanent\\r\\nconquest. I am confident that the nations that have learned the\\r\\ndiscipline of freedom and that have settled with self-possession to its\\r\\nordered practice are now about to make conquest of the world by the\\r\\nsheer power of example and of friendly helpfulness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe peoples who have but just come out from under the yoke of arbitrary\\r\\ngovernment and who are now coming at last into their freedom will never\\r\\nfind the treasures of liberty they are in search of if they look for\\r\\nthem by the light of the torch. They will find that every pathway that\\r\\nis stained with the blood of their own brothers leads to the wilderness,\\r\\nnot to the seat of their hope. They are now face to face with their\\r\\ninitial test. We must hold the light steady until they find themselves.\\r\\nAnd in the meantime, if it be possible, we must establish a peace that\\r\\nwill justly define their place among the nations, remove all fear of\\r\\ntheir neighbors and of their former masters, and enable them to live in\\r\\nsecurity and contentment when they have set their own affairs in order.\\r\\nI, for one, do not doubt their purpose or their capacity. There are some\\r\\nhappy signs that they know and will choose the way of self-control and\\r\\npeaceful accommodation. If they do, we shall put our aid at their\\r\\ndisposal in every way that we can. If they do not, we must await with\\r\\npatience and sympathy the awakening and recovery that will assuredly\\r\\ncome at last.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOURTEEN PRINCIPLES OF PEACE\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Tuesday, January 8, 1918, President Wilson placed the peace terms of\\r\\nthe United States Government before both houses of Congress, in joint\\r\\nsession. The fourteen principles were:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Open covenants of peace, openly arrived at, after which there shall\\r\\nbe no private international understanding of any kind, but diplomacy\\r\\nshall proceed always frankly and in the public view.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Absolute freedom of navigation upon the seas, outside territorial\\r\\nwaters, alike in peace and war, except as the seas may be closed in\\r\\nwhole or in part by international action for the enforcement of\\r\\ninternational covenants.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. The removal, so far as possible, of all economic barriers and the\\r\\nestablishment of an equality of trade conditions among all the nations\\r\\nconsenting to the peace and associating themselves for its maintenance.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Adequate guarantees given and taken that national armaments will be\\r\\nreduced to the lowest point consistent with domestic safety.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. A free, open-minded and absolutely impartial adjustment of all\\r\\nColonial claims based upon a strict observance of the principle that in\\r\\ndetermining all such questions of sovereignty, the interests of the\\r\\npopulations concerned must have equal weight with the equitable claims\\r\\nof the government whose title is to be determined.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. The evacuation of all Russian territory and such a settlement of all\\r\\nquestions affecting Russia as will secure the best and freest\\r\\nco-operation of the other nations of the world in obtaining for her an\\r\\nunhampered and unembarrassed opportunity for the independent\\r\\ndetermination of her own political development and national policy, and\\r\\nassure her of a sincere welcome into the society of free nations under\\r\\ninstitutions of her own choosing; and, more than a welcome, assistance\\r\\nalso of every kind that she may need and may herself desire. The\\r\\ntreatment accorded Russia by her sister nations in the months to come\\r\\nwill be the acid test of their good will, of their comprehension of her\\r\\nneeds, as distinguished from their own interests, and of their\\r\\nintelligent and unselfish sympathy.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. Belgium, the whole world will agree, must be evacuated and restored,\\r\\nwithout any attempt to limit the sovereignty which she enjoys in common\\r\\nwith all other free nations. No other single act will serve as this will\\r\\nserve to restore confidence among the nations in the laws which they\\r\\nhave themselves set and determined for the government of their relations\\r\\nwith one another. Without this healing act the whole structure and\\r\\nvalidity of international law is forever impaired.\\r\\n\\r\\n8. All French territory should be freed and the invaded portions\\r\\nrestored, and the wrong done to France by Prussia in 1871, in the matter\\r\\nof Alsace-Lorraine, which has unsettled the peace of the world for\\r\\nnearly fifty years, should be righted, in order that peace may once more\\r\\nbe made secure in the interests of all.\\r\\n\\r\\n9. A readjustment of the frontiers of Italy should be effected along\\r\\nclearly recognized lines of nationality.\\r\\n\\r\\n10. The peoples of Austria-Hungary, whose place among the nations we\\r\\nwish to see safeguarded and restored, should be accorded the freest\\r\\nopportunity of autonomous development.\\r\\n\\r\\n11. Roumania, Serbia and Montenegro should be evacuated, occupied\\r\\nterritories restored; Serbia accorded free and secure access to the sea,\\r\\nand the relations of the several Balkan States to one another determined\\r\\nby friendly counsel along historically established lines of allegiance\\r\\nand nationality; and international guarantees of the political and\\r\\neconomic independence and territorial integrity, of the several Balkan\\r\\nStates, should be entered into.\\r\\n\\r\\n12. The Turkish portion of the present Ottoman Empire should be assured\\r\\na secure sovereignty, but the other nationalities which are now under\\r\\nTurkish rule, should be assured an undoubted security of life and an\\r\\nabsolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous development, and the\\r\\nDardanelles should be permanently opened as a free passage to the ships\\r\\nand commerce of all nations under international guarantees.\\r\\n\\r\\n13. An independent Polish State should be erected which should include\\r\\nthe territories inhabited by indisputably Polish populations, which\\r\\nshould be assured a free and secure access to the sea, and whose\\r\\npolitical and economic independence and territorial integrity should be\\r\\nguaranteed by international covenants.\\r\\n\\r\\n14. General association of nations must be formed under specific\\r\\ncovenants for the purpose of affording mutual guarantees of political\\r\\nindependence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Wilson in his address to Congress on February 11, 1918,\\r\\npresented these four principles which are to be applied in arranging\\r\\nworld peace:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1. That each part of the final settlement must be based upon the\\r\\nessential justice of that particular case and upon such adjustments, as\\r\\nare most likely to bring a peace that will be permanent.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. That peoples and provinces are not to be bartered about from\\r\\nsovereignty to sovereignty as if they were mere chattels and pawns in a\\r\\ngame, even the great game now forever discredited, of the balance of\\r\\npower; but that\\r\\n\\r\\n3: Every territorial settlement must be made in the interest and for the\\r\\nbenefit of the populations concerned, and not as part of any mere\\r\\nadjustment or compromise of claims amongst rival states; and,\\r\\n\\r\\n4. That all well-defined national aspirations shall be accorded the\\r\\nutmost satisfaction that can be accorded them without introducing new or\\r\\nperpetuating old elements of discord and antagonism that would be likely\\r\\nin time to break the peace of Europe and consequently of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Wilson, in his Liberty Loan address in New York on September\\r\\n27th, thus stated this government\\'s interpretation of its duty with\\r\\nregard to peace:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. The impartial justice meted out must involve no discrimination\\r\\nbetween those to whom we wish to be just and those to whom we do not\\r\\nwish to be just. It must be a justice that plays no favorites and knows\\r\\nno standard but the equal rights of the several peoples concerned;\\r\\n\\r\\n2. No special or separate interest of any single nation or any group of\\r\\nnations can be made the basis of any part of the settlement which is not\\r\\nconsistent with the common interests of all;\\r\\n\\r\\n3. There can be no leagues or alliances or special covenants and\\r\\nunderstandings within the general and common family of the League of\\r\\nNations;\\r\\n\\r\\n4. And more specifically, there can be no special, selfish economic\\r\\ncombinations within the league and no employment of any form of economic\\r\\nboycott or exclusion except as the power of economic penalty by\\r\\nexclusion from the markets of the world may be vested in the League of\\r\\nNations itself as a means of discipline and control.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. All international agreements and treaties of every kind must be made\\r\\nknown in their entirety to the rest of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Map: Europe, North Africa, East Asia.]\\r\\n  THE WAR ZONE ESTABLISHED BY GERMANY, FEBRUARY, 1917, THAT BROUGHT\\r\\n  AMERICA INTO THE WAR.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER LVI\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WAR BY YEARS\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany\\'s military strength developed during forty years of preparation,\\r\\nand the offensive plans of the German High Command developed in\\r\\nconnection with an extraordinary spy service in France, Belgium, Russia,\\r\\nEngland and the United States, culminated in a simultaneous campaign on\\r\\nland and by sea, affecting these five nations.\\r\\n\\r\\nAUGUST 1, 1914-AUGUST 1, 1915\\r\\n\\r\\nBelgium and Northern France were overrun by a German invading force\\r\\nunder General von Kluck. The heroic effort of the French army under\\r\\nGeneral Joffre and a supreme strategic thrust at the German center by\\r\\nGeneral Foch turned back the German tide at the battle of the Marne. The\\r\\nscientific diabolism of the German High Command was revealed when poison\\r\\ngas was projected against the Canadians at Ypres, torturing, blinding\\r\\nand killing thousands.\\r\\n\\r\\nGerman terrorism on the high seas culminated in the sinking of the\\r\\nCunard liner Lusitania by a German submarine off the Irish coast. Men,\\r\\nwomen and children to the number of 1,152 lost their lives. Of these 102\\r\\nwere Americans.\\r\\n\\r\\nGerman colonies in South Africa were invaded by British South African\\r\\ntroops under General Louis Botha, who during the Boer War commanded a\\r\\ndivision against the British. The German holdings at Tsing-Tau and in\\r\\nthe Marshall Islands were seized by Japan.\\r\\n\\r\\nGerman cruisers that had raided sea-going commerce were destroyed. The\\r\\nmost noted of these was the Emden, which was defeated and destroyed by\\r\\nthe Australian cruiser Sydney off the Cocos Islands.\\r\\n\\r\\nGerman sea power was further humiliated in a running fight off Helgoland\\r\\nin which the battle cruiser Blucher was sunk and in a battle off the\\r\\nFalkland Islands in which three German cruisers were destroyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nItaly entered the war on May 23,1915, and invaded Austria on a\\r\\nsixty-mile front. Russian forces, after early successes, were defeated\\r\\nat Tannenburg by von Hindenburg, the outstanding military genius on the\\r\\nGerman side.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe development of aircraft as an aid to artillery and as a destructive\\r\\nforce on its own account, was rapid, and the use of machine guns and\\r\\nhand grenades in trench operations became general.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAUGUST 1, 1915-AUGUST 1, 1916\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tragic sea and land operations at the Dardanelles and Gallipoli\\r\\nmarked this year with red in British history. Sir Douglas Haig succeeded\\r\\nSir John French as Commander-in-Chief of British forces in France. The\\r\\noutstanding operation of the British forces on the western front was the\\r\\nbloody battle of the Somme, beginning July 1st, and continuing until the\\r\\nfall of 1915. The losses on both sides in that titanic struggle\\r\\nstaggered two continents. Especially heroic were the attacks of the\\r\\nCanadians in that great battle and especially heavy were the losses in\\r\\nkilled and wounded of the Canadian regiments. They ranked in magnitude\\r\\nwith the depletion that came to the Australian and New Zealand armies in\\r\\nthe fatal Gallipoli campaign.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis year will be glorious forever in the annals of France because of\\r\\nthe heroic defense at Verdun. That battle tested to the limit the\\r\\noffensive strength of the German machine and it was found lacking in\\r\\npower to pierce the superhuman defense of the heroic French forces under\\r\\nPetain and Nivelle.\\r\\n\\r\\nBulgaria entered the war on October 14, 1915, with a declaration of war\\r\\nagainst helpless Serbia. Greece, torn by internal dissensions, inclined\\r\\nfirst to one side, then to the other. The occupation of Saloniki by\\r\\nFrench and British expeditionary forces finally swung the archipelago to\\r\\nthe Allies.\\r\\n\\r\\nA British Mesopotamian force under General Townshend, poorly equipped\\r\\nand unsupported, was cut off in Kut-el-Amara, and surrendered to the\\r\\nTurks on April 29, 1916.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Italian forces under General Cadorna made a sensational advance\\r\\nterminating in the capture of Gorizia. Portugal entered the war on the\\r\\nside of the Allies after it had refused to give up to Germany several\\r\\nGerman ships interned in Portuguese ports.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn object lesson in German submarine possibilities was given America\\r\\nwhen the Deutschland, a super-submarine cargo vessel, arrived in\\r\\nBaltimore, Maryland, on July 9, 1916. The Deutschland later was\\r\\nconverted into a naval submarine and re-visited American shores, sinking\\r\\na number of merchant vessels. It was one of the German submarine fleet\\r\\nsurrendered to the Allies in November, 1918.\\r\\n\\r\\nRussia proved itself to be a military ineffective. German armies under\\r\\nvon Mackensen and von Hindenburg occupied Warsaw, Brest-Litovsk, Lutsk,\\r\\nand Grodno. Grand Duke Nicholas was removed from the command of the\\r\\nRussian armies and Czar Nicholas assumed command.\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany\\'s pretensions to sea power ended with the battle of Jutland, May\\r\\n31, 1916, when its High Seas fleet fled after a running fight with\\r\\nBritish cruisers and destroyers. Never, thereafter, during the war did\\r\\nthe German ships venture out of the Bight of Helgoland.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAUGUST 1, 1916-AUGUST 1, 1917\\r\\n\\r\\nThis year was marked by two dramatic episodes. The first of these was\\r\\nthe sudden entrance and the equally sudden exit of Roumania as a factor\\r\\nin the World War.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second was the appearance of the United States which became the\\r\\ndeciding factor in the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoumania created enthusiasm in Allied countries when it declared war on\\r\\nAustria-Hungary August 27th. A sudden descent by a Roumanian army into\\r\\nTransylvania on August 30th was hailed as the harbinger of further\\r\\nsuccesses. These hopes were turned to ashes when von Mackensen headed an\\r\\nirresistible German and Austrian rush which fairly inundated Roumania.\\r\\nThe retreat from Transylvania by the Roumanians was turned into a rout.\\r\\nBulgarian forces invaded the Dobrudja region of Roumania and on November\\r\\n28th the seat of the Roumanian Government was transferred from\\r\\nBucharest, the capital, to Jassy. Roumania ceased to be a factor in the\\r\\nwar on December 6th, when Bucharest fell to von Mackensen. Emperor Franz\\r\\nJosef of Austria-Hungary died on November 22d, while Austrian hopes were\\r\\nat their highest.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerica\\'s appearance as a belligerent was forecast on January 31, 1917,\\r\\nwhen Germany announced its intention of sinking all vessels in a\\r\\nblockade zone around the British Isles. Count von Bernstorff was handed\\r\\nhis passports on February 3d, and on April 2d President Wilson, in a\\r\\nremarkable address to Congress, advised a declaration of war by the\\r\\nUnited States against Germany. This was consummated by a formal vote of\\r\\nCongress declaring war on April 6th.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis action by America was followed by the organization of a Council of\\r\\nNational Defense. Under this body the resources of the nation were\\r\\nmobilized. The council was later virtually abandoned as an organizing\\r\\nfactor, its functions going to the War Industries Board, presided over\\r\\nby Bernard Baruch; the Fuel Administration, under Dr. Harry A. Garfield;\\r\\nthe War Trade Board, with Vance C. McCormick at its head; and other\\r\\ngovernmental bodies. George Creel headed the Committee on Public\\r\\nInformation.\\r\\n\\r\\nConscription was decided upon as the foundation of America\\'s war-making\\r\\npolicy, and the training of officers and privates in great training\\r\\ncamps was commenced. Great shipping and aircraft programs were\\r\\nformulated and the nation as a whole was placed upon a war footing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russian revolution beginning in bread riots in Petrograd, spread\\r\\nthroughout that country, with the result that Russia disappeared as one\\r\\nof the Entente Allies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFROM AUGUST 1, 1917-NOVEMBER 11, 1918\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerica\\'s might and efficiency were revealed in the speed and\\r\\nthoroughness with which her military, naval and civilian resources were\\r\\nmobilized and thrown into the conflict. Under the supervision of the\\r\\nChief of Staff, two million American soldiers received the final touches\\r\\nin their military training and were transported safely overseas. They\\r\\nbecame the decisive factor in the war during the summer and fall of\\r\\n1918. To their glory be it recorded they never retreated.\\r\\nChateau-Thierry, St. Mihiel, Siecheprey, Boureches Wood, Cantigny,\\r\\nBelleau Wood, the Argonne, Sedan and Stenay are names that will rank in\\r\\nAmerican history with Yorktown, New Orleans and Gettysburg. The \"land of\\r\\ndollars\" became over night the \"land of high ideals\" to the civilized\\r\\nworld. Lightless nights in cities, restriction of the use of gasoline on\\r\\nSundays and daylight-saving legislation linked civilians to soldiers in\\r\\nwar effort.\\r\\n\\r\\nItaly suffered a severe reverse beginning October 24, 1917, when the\\r\\nGerman forces rushed through a portion of the Italian army that had been\\r\\nhoney-combed with pro-German Socialistic propaganda.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada again emblazoned its name in history through the heroic capture\\r\\nof Passchendaele on November 6, 1917.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russian revolution turned to the Bolsheviki when Lenine and Trotsky\\r\\nat the head of the Reds seized Petrograd on November 7th and deposed\\r\\nAlexander Kerensky, leader of the Moderate Socialists. The Czar Nicholas\\r\\nwas executed by the victorious Bolsheviki and the Imperial family made\\r\\ncaptives.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British Mesopotamian forces advanced into Palestine and Mesopotamia,\\r\\ndestroying the Turkish army under Ahmed Bey in a battle terminating\\r\\nSeptember 29, 1917. General Stanley Maude, the leader of the expedition,\\r\\ndied in Mesopotamia November 18, 1917.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Allenby commanding British and Arabian forces, routed and\\r\\ndestroyed three Turkish armies in Palestine, capturing Jerusalem which\\r\\nhad been held by the Turks for six hundred and seventy three years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe turning point of the war came on March 29, 1918, when General Foch\\r\\nwas chosen Commander-in-Chief of all the Allied forces. This followed\\r\\nGermany\\'s great drive on a fifty-mile front from Arras to La Fere.\\r\\nSuccessive German thrusts were halted by the Allied forces now strongly\\r\\nreinforced by Americans.\\r\\n\\r\\nFoch, patiently biding his time, elected to halt the German drive with\\r\\nAmericans. The Marines of the United States forces were given the post\\r\\nof honor, and at Chateau-Thierry the counter-thrust of Foch was\\r\\ncommenced by a complete defeat of the Prussian Guard and other crack\\r\\nGerman regiments, by the untried soldiers of America.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Chateau-Thierry to the armistice which went into effect at eleven\\r\\no\\'clock on November 11th was only a short span of time, but in it was\\r\\ncompressed the humiliation of arrogant Teutonic imperialism, the\\r\\ndestruction of militaristic autocracy, and the liberation of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER LVII\\r\\n\\r\\nBEHIND AMERICA\\'S BATTLE LINE\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL MARCH\\'S OWN STORY OF THE WORK OF THE MILITARY INTELLIGENCE\\r\\nDIVISION--OF THE WAR PLANS DIVISION--OF THE PURCHASE AND TRAFFIC\\r\\nDIVISION--HOW MEN, MUNITIONS AND SUPPLIES REACHED THE WESTERN FRONT.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is important that a general summary of America\\'s military\\r\\npreparations, a detailed description of the operations behind the battle\\r\\nline and a detailed chronology of America\\'s principal military\\r\\noperations in France during the year 1918 should be presented to the\\r\\nreader. Such a summary is afforded by the report of General Peyton C.\\r\\nMarch, Chief of Staff, United States Army, for the last year of the war.\\r\\nAddressing the Secretary of War, General March wrote in part:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe signing of the armistice on November 11, 1918, has brought to a\\r\\nsuccessful conclusion the most remarkable achievement in the history of\\r\\nall warfare.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entry of the United States into the war on April 6, 1917, found the\\r\\nNation about as thoroughly unprepared for the great task which was\\r\\nconfronting it as any great nation which had ever engaged in war.\\r\\nStarting from a minimum of organized strength, within this short period\\r\\nof sixteen months the entire resources of the country in men, money, and\\r\\nmunitions have been placed under central control, and at the end of this\\r\\nperiod the Nation was in its full stride and had accomplished, from a\\r\\nmilitary standpoint, what our enemy regarded as the impossible. The most\\r\\nimportant single thing, perhaps, in this record of accomplishment, was\\r\\nthe immediate passage by Congress of the draft law, without which it\\r\\nwould have been impossible to have raised the men necessary for victory.\\r\\nIn organizing, training, and supplying the vast numbers of men made\\r\\navailable by the draft law very many changes have been made necessary in\\r\\nthe organization of the War Department and in the methods existing\\r\\ntherein which were inherited from the times of profound peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly after my installation as Chief of Staff I adopted the principle\\r\\nof interchange of the personnel of the various staff corps of the War\\r\\nDepartment with men who had training in France, and in the application\\r\\nof this principle placed as the heads of various bureaus officers\\r\\nselected on account of their ability and experience in the system of\\r\\nwarfare as conducted in France.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this time, also, I found that the divisions organized in our armies\\r\\nwere still regarded as separate units, designated by different titles in\\r\\naccordance with their origin. This made three different kinds of\\r\\ndivisions in the United States army--the Regular army, the National\\r\\nGuard, and National army divisions. All these distinctions were\\r\\nabolished and the entire army consolidated into a United States army,\\r\\nwithout regard to the source from which drawn. The source of supply of\\r\\nall replacements for the various elements of the army, without regard to\\r\\ntheir origin, was drafted men; and the titles had no significance\\r\\nwhatever and were a source of possible disturbance from the standpoint\\r\\nof military efficiency. There was, in fact, no actual difference between\\r\\nthese divisions with respect to efficiency--all have done high-grade\\r\\nwork from whatever source drawn. All have shown courage and capacity for\\r\\nquick absorption of the fundamentals of modern military training and\\r\\nirresistible dash and force in actual fighting.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I returned from France on March 1, 1918, I came back with the\\r\\nbelief that the most fundamental necessity, both for the American\\r\\nExpeditionary Force and for the success of the allies, was that the\\r\\nshipment of troops to France should be vastly increased and should have\\r\\npriority over everything else; and as this policy became effective a\\r\\nstudy was instituted looking to our putting in France, if that was\\r\\npossible, enough men to bring the war to a conclusion in the shortest\\r\\nperiod possible. After a study of the entire situation, including as\\r\\naccurate an estimate of the potential strength of our allies on the\\r\\nwestern front and of the probable German strength as was possible, I\\r\\ncame to the conclusion that the war might be brought to an end in 1919,\\r\\nprovided we were able to land in France by June 30th of that year eighty\\r\\nAmerican divisions of a strength of 3,360,000 men. On July 18, 1918, I\\r\\nsubmitted to you a formal memorandum, accompanied by a study of methods\\r\\nby which the men could be obtained, the supplies procured, and an\\r\\nanalysis of the shipping which must be obtained in order to accomplish\\r\\nthis very large military program. This was accompanied by an estimate of\\r\\nthe cost of the proposed program.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this study I recommended to you the adoption, as the American\\r\\nprogram, of eighty divisions in France and eighteen at home by June 30,\\r\\n1919, based on a total strength of the American army of 4,850,000 men.\\r\\nThis was approved by you and by the President of the United States and\\r\\nadopted as our formal military program. To carry this program into\\r\\neffect required the adoption by Congress of a change in the draft ages\\r\\nso as to include men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five years,\\r\\nand also created a deficiency over the enormous appropriations already\\r\\nmade by Congress of some $7,000,000,000. The presentation of the program\\r\\nto Congress, accompanied by the statement that this increase in the\\r\\narmy, if laws were passed by Congress which would make it effective,\\r\\nwould lead to success in 1919, produced prompt and favorable\\r\\nconsideration by that body. Up to the signing of the armistice troops\\r\\nwere being transported to France monthly in accordance with that\\r\\nprogram. The results speak for themselves....\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph]\\r\\n  Photo by International Film Service.\\r\\n  THE SALVATION ARMY ON THE WESTERN FRONT\\r\\n  A shell-proof dugout used as a rest room for soldiers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph]\\r\\n  Copyright Press Illustrating Service.\\r\\n  THE Y.

N.Y.\\r\\n  A LETTER FROM HOME\\r\\n  In thousands of France\\'s little stone houses this scene has been\\r\\n  duplicated. In the towns and villages soldiers were assigned or\\r\\n  \"billeted\" to the houses of the inhabitants with the result that a\\r\\n  deep mutual respect grew up between the two nationalities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the year, the most important in the history of the country both\\r\\nfrom a military and civil standpoint, there have been four heads of the\\r\\nGeneral Staff: Major-General Hugh L. Scott, from the outbreak of the war\\r\\nuntil his retirement, September 22, 1917; General Tasker H. Bliss, from\\r\\nthat date until May 19, 1918; Major-General John Biddle, Acting Chief of\\r\\nStaff at periods during the absence of General Bliss in France, from\\r\\nOctober 29, 1917, to December 16, 1917, and from January 9, 1918, to\\r\\nMarch 3, 1918. I assumed the duties of Acting Chief of Staff on March 4,\\r\\n1918, became Chief of Staff May 20, 1918, and have continued on that\\r\\nduty since.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was evident, as the war progressed, that the General Staff was acting\\r\\nunder an organization and in accordance with regulations which were not\\r\\nonly unsuited to the duties and responsibilities confronting it, but\\r\\nwere wholly out of date and were not suited to any General Staff\\r\\norganization. Successive revisions of the orders under which the General\\r\\nStaff was acting were made as events demanded, until the experience of\\r\\nthe year crystallized the organization of the General Staff into that\\r\\nset forth in General Order No. 80 of the War Department. This order\\r\\ndivides the work of the General Staff into four primary divisions: 1.\\r\\nOperations; 2. Purchase, Storage, and Traffic; 3. Military Intelligence;\\r\\n4. War Plans. Each of these divisions is under the direction of a\\r\\ndirector; who is Assistant Chief of Staff and is a general officer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOPERATIONS DIVISION\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Operations Division is under the charge of Major-General Henry\\r\\nJervey, United States army, as Director of Operations and Assistant\\r\\nChief of Staff. This division is a consolidation of the former\\r\\nOperations Committee and Equipment Committee, which pertained to the War\\r\\nCollege under the previous organization. The Operations Division has had\\r\\ncharge of the increase in the personnel of the army during the year. On\\r\\nJune 30, 1917, the Regular army consisted of 250,357 officers and\\r\\nenlisted men. On August 5,1917, 379,323 officers and men of the National\\r\\nGuard were drafted into the Federal service. There were a few special\\r\\ndrafts of small numbers of National Guardsmen into the Federal service\\r\\nafter August 5, 1917. During the period covered by this report this\\r\\ndivision handled the calls into service of men obtained under the draft,\\r\\nthe organization of these men into divisions and units necessary for the\\r\\narmy, and turned over for shipment overseas up to November 8, 1918,\\r\\n2,047,667 men. The grand total of men in the army from returns for the\\r\\nperiod ending October 15th is 3,624,774. This force was organized into\\r\\ndivisions, the proper proportion of corps, army, and service of supply\\r\\ntroops, and of replacement camps and training centers for Infantry,\\r\\nField Artillery, and Machine Guns in the United States. Central\\r\\nofficers\\' training schools were organized at each of the replacement\\r\\ncamps. Replacement camps and training centers for the various staff\\r\\ndepartments were also organized. Development battalions were organized\\r\\nat all division camps and large posts and camps for the purpose of\\r\\ndeveloping men of poor physique and the instruction of illiterates and\\r\\nnon-English-speaking men of the draft. During the fiscal year 5,377,468\\r\\nofficers and men were moved by railroad to and from the camps.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Operations Division has during the year also handled all matters\\r\\nconnected with the adoption of new types of equipment, fixing allowances\\r\\nfor various units, the preparation of tables of equipment for them, and\\r\\nthe distribution and issue of equipment, and the determination of\\r\\npriorities of such issue.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has supervised and studied the needs of camps and construction work\\r\\ntherein, and this work in general has been characterized by marked\\r\\nability and devotion to duty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPURCHASE, STORAGE AND TRAFFIC DIVISION\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Division of Purchase, Storage and Traffic is under the charge of\\r\\nMajor-General George W. Goethals, United States army, as Assistant Chief\\r\\nof Staff and Director of Purchase, Storage and Traffic. This division\\r\\nwas organized by merging divisions previously created, and which had\\r\\nbeen called \"Storage and Traffic\" and \"Purchase and Supply.\" The new\\r\\ndivision thus organized was subdivided into Embarkation Service,\\r\\nStorage, Inland Traffic Service, and Purchase and Supply Branch.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmbarkation.--At the outbreak of the war the Quartermaster\\'s Department\\r\\nhad charge of the transportation of troops and supplies and continued to\\r\\nexercise these functions until August 4, 1917, when they were\\r\\ntransferred to a separate division of the General Staff, specially\\r\\ncreated for the purpose, and designated as the Embarkation Service. As\\r\\nalready noted, this was subsequently merged with the Storage and Traffic\\r\\nDivision.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo primary ports of embarkation were established, one with headquarters\\r\\nat Hoboken, N. J., and the other at Newport News, Va., each under the\\r\\ncommand of a general officer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Quartermaster\\'s Department was operating a service to Panama from\\r\\nNew York, but with the shipment of troops to France a new condition\\r\\narose which was met only in part by taking over the Hoboken piers,\\r\\nformerly owned by the Hamburg-American and North German Lloyd steamship\\r\\ncompanies, and the magnitude of the undertaking necessitated additional\\r\\nfacilities. The situation at New York is complicated by the large amount\\r\\nof general shipping using the port, the diversified interests, even\\r\\nthose of the government, and the complicated jurisdiction. An effort was\\r\\nmade to bring about such a consolidation and unification as to secure\\r\\ngreater co-operation with increased efficiency. To this end the War\\r\\nBoard for the Port of New York was established in November, 1917. It was\\r\\nvested with full power and authority to make rules and regulations for\\r\\noperating the facilities of the port, to determine priorities, and to do\\r\\nwhat was necessary to provide for the prompt and economical dispatch of\\r\\nthe business of the government in and about the port. Mr. Irving T. Bush\\r\\nwas selected as the board\\'s representative, with the title of chief\\r\\nexecutive officer. In addition to representing the board he was to\\r\\narrange for the co-operative use of piers, warehouses, lighterage,\\r\\nterminals, railroads, trucking, and all other transportation facilities\\r\\nin and about the port.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition the need was felt for having a shipping expert closely\\r\\nassociated with the Embarkation Service, familiar with the facilities at\\r\\nvarious ports, so that he could properly assign ships, select ships for\\r\\nthe cargo to be moved, and arrange for their loading. Mr. Joseph T.\\r\\nLilly was selected for this work and appointed director of embarkation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February, 1918, the available cargo ships were not sufficient to\\r\\ncarry the supplies needed for maintaining the troops overseas. To secure\\r\\nthe requisite additional tonnage necessitated taking ships from the\\r\\nexisting trade routes and determining from what imports and exports they\\r\\ncould best be spared without interference with those which were\\r\\nabsolutely necessary. This brought about a new situation which could be\\r\\nhandled only by those having a knowledge of the trades as well as the\\r\\ncharacteristics of various ships serving them, since some of them were\\r\\nsuitable for War Department needs and some were not. It had happened\\r\\nthat an advantageous exchange of ships could have been made with the\\r\\nAllies by which valuable time could have been saved in getting over\\r\\ncargo, but there was lack of knowledge as well as lack of authority. The\\r\\nwhole situation was gone over at a conference between the Secretary of\\r\\nWar and the chairman of the Shipping Board, as a result of which the\\r\\nShipping Control Committee was created, consisting of Mr. P. A. S.\\r\\nFranklin, chairman; Mr. H. H. Raymond; and Sir Connop Guthrie,\\r\\nrepresentative of the Allies\\' shipping interests. The allocation and\\r\\ndistribution of available tonnage, as well as questions of exchange of\\r\\nships, was vested in this committee. So far as the work of the War\\r\\nDepartment was concerned the committee was charged with the loading and\\r\\nunloading cargo, coaling, supplies, repairs, and, except where vessels\\r\\nare commanded by the navy, of inspection and manning. They also have\\r\\ncharge of the management and operation of docks, piers, slips, loading\\r\\nand discharging facilities under the control of the department, or of\\r\\nany board, officers, or agency operating such facilities, together with\\r\\nthe direction and management of minor craft to be used in connection\\r\\nwith the handling of steamers and their cargoes in port. The amount of\\r\\ncargo shipped overseas, the efficiency of the loading, and the reduction\\r\\nof the time of stay in the ports attest to the efficient manner in which\\r\\nthe committee has operated, and it is not too much to say that they are\\r\\nto be largely credited with the results that have been accomplished.\\r\\n\\r\\nExpeditionary depots were operated at Boston, Mass., Philadelphia, Pa.,\\r\\nand Baltimore, Md., primarily for the movement of freight. When cargo\\r\\nships having accommodations for troops were loaded at these ports troops\\r\\nfor the available space were sent from the camps under the direction of\\r\\nthe commanding general at Hoboken; similarly shipments of troops were\\r\\nmade from Montreal, Canada, and Halifax, Nova Scotia, when practicable.\\r\\nCargo shipments were also made from other ports on the Atlantic and Gulf\\r\\ncoasts.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 25, 1918, the water transport branch of the Quartermaster\\'s\\r\\nDepartment was transferred and made a part of the Embarkation Service.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April conditions abroad necessitated the speeding up shipments of\\r\\ntroops, and brought to the service such transports as the British\\r\\nGovernment could spare for the purpose, which have been continued in\\r\\nuse. The army transports are officered and manned by the navy, as is the\\r\\ngreater number of the cargo ships. The arrangements for transferring\\r\\nships to naval control as well as for convoys for troop and cargo ships\\r\\nare handled through the Chief of Operations of the navy, who has given\\r\\nevery assistance. The way in which the work has been handled by the navy\\r\\nis shown by the loss of no troop ships which were under their protection\\r\\non the eastbound trips.\\r\\n\\r\\nInland Traffic.--The inland traffic service was established on January\\r\\n10, 1918. As the government had taken over all of the railroads, the\\r\\nnecessity for working in harmony with the organization that was placed\\r\\nin charge was apparent, and the Railroad Administration was requested to\\r\\nrecommend a competent traffic man to handle the work. This resulted in\\r\\nthe selection and assignment of Mr. H. M. Adams as chief of the section.\\r\\nHe in turn secured his expert assistants through the Railroad\\r\\nAdministration.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time the section was formed approximately 15,000 carloads of War\\r\\nDepartment property held in cars were congesting various Atlantic ports.\\r\\nSteps were taken which relieved this condition and brought about an\\r\\norderly movement of the traffic when and in the quantities desired. The\\r\\nvalue of the inland traffic service was soon demonstrated and led to a\\r\\nreorganization, with authority to take over the transportation\\r\\norganizations of the various bureaus of the War Department, both at\\r\\nWashington and throughout the country, so that as now organized the\\r\\nchief of the inland traffic service exercises direct control of the\\r\\ntransportation of troops, of the supplies of and for the various bureaus\\r\\nof the War Department, and for the contractors working for the several\\r\\nbureaus. This control extends over the entire country through the medium\\r\\nof representatives stationed at various traffic centers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorking in conjunction with the Railroad Administration has resulted in\\r\\nminimizing the burdens of the carriers. The work has been performed most\\r\\nefficiently. More than 5,000,000 troops have been moved from their\\r\\nhomes, from one camp to another, and from camps to the points of\\r\\nembarkation within the period covered by this report.\\r\\n\\r\\nArrangements have been made by which this branch will take charge of all\\r\\nexpress movements for the War Department, as well as the tracing of the\\r\\nmovements of all War Department property, including the contractors and\\r\\nothers for the various bureaus.\\r\\n\\r\\nPurchase and Supply.--The Purchase and Supply Branch is organized into\\r\\nthe following subsections: Supply Program, Purchase, Production,\\r\\nFinance, and Emergency.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMILITARY INTELLIGENCE DIVISION\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Military Intelligence Division has as director Brigadier-General\\r\\nMarlborough Churchill, United States army, Assistant Chief of Staff.\\r\\nThis division, which had been a branch, first of the War Plans Division\\r\\nand then of the Executive Division of the General Staff, was separated\\r\\ncompletely and made an independent division by general orders which\\r\\nreorganized the General Staff, thus putting the Military Intelligence\\r\\nDivision on a par with similar services of general staffs of other\\r\\nnations of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe duties of the Military Intelligence Division consist, in general, in\\r\\nthe organization of the intelligence service, positive and negative,\\r\\nincluding the collection and coordination of military information; the\\r\\nsupervision of the department intelligence officers and intelligence\\r\\nofficers at posts, stations, camps, and with commands in the field, in\\r\\nmatters relating to military intelligence; the direction of\\r\\ncounter-espionage work; the preparation of instruction in military\\r\\nintelligence work for the use of our forces; the consideration of\\r\\nquestions of policy promulgated by the General Staff in all matters of\\r\\nmilitary intelligence; the co-operation with intelligence branches of\\r\\nthe general staffs of other countries; the supervision of the training\\r\\nof officers for intelligence duty, the obtaining and issuing of maps:\\r\\nand the disbursement of and accounting for intelligence funds.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the important functions of the Director of the Military\\r\\nIntelligence Division is that of coordinating the work of this service\\r\\nwith other intelligence agencies. Possible duplications of work and\\r\\ninvestigation by the State Department, Treasury Department, Department\\r\\nof Justice, Navy Department, War Trade Board, and the War Department are\\r\\navoided or adjusted at weekly conferences held at the Department of\\r\\nJustice and attended by representatives of these departments who\\r\\nconsider matters of common interest. For a similar purpose, the Director\\r\\nof Military Intelligence is a member of the Fire Prevention Committee,\\r\\nthe War Industries Board, and the National Research Council.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the purpose of securing close co-operation between the military\\r\\nintelligence services of the nations associated in the war, the British\\r\\nand French Governments were requested by the United States to send\\r\\nofficers to this country for liaison duty. These officers have been of\\r\\ngreat assistance in accomplishing this end, because of their knowledge\\r\\nof the details of intelligence work in Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the performance of the service for which the Military Intelligence\\r\\nDivision was developed, eight sections have been established, each\\r\\ndealing with its peculiar problems, and working in close liaison with\\r\\nits fellows....\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may not be amiss to call attention to the enthusiastic co-operation\\r\\nwhich this division has consistently received from the various other\\r\\nintelligence agencies, civilian and others. The American Protective\\r\\nLeague, the Department of Justice, the Office of Naval Intelligence, the\\r\\nCustoms, the War Trade Intelligence have all co-operated in the\\r\\nheartiest manner with each and every effort of the Military Intelligence\\r\\nDivision. Indeed, it is hardly saying too much to state that the success\\r\\nof the Military Intelligence Division has in a very large measure been\\r\\ndue to the loyal assistance which it has received at all times from the\\r\\nvarious agencies whose functions are similar to its own.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWAR PLANS DIVISION\\r\\n\\r\\nThe War Plans Division of the General Staff is under the direction of\\r\\nBrigadier-General Lytle Brown, as Director and Assistant Chief of\\r\\nStaff. A very large volume of work has been accomplished by this\\r\\ndivision during the year. Exclusive of subjects pertaining to the\\r\\nhistorical branch, the inventions section, and routine matters, 9,287\\r\\ncases were handled by the division during the year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese included studies as to policies for defense and the organization\\r\\nof the military forces in general as published in Tables of\\r\\nOrganization, completed studies on the policy and plans for training the\\r\\narmy in general, training replacement troops, training cadres, training\\r\\ncenters, training schools, schools for senior and staff officers, and\\r\\nplans for physical reconstruction and vocational training of wounded\\r\\nsoldiers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, through the Training Section, the War Plans Division has\\r\\nsupervision of training in general and has kept in touch by inspections\\r\\nby its officers with methods used and progress made.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Legislative, Regulations, and Rules Branch of the War Plans Division\\r\\nhas handled numerous changes in Army Regulations and War Department\\r\\norders made necessary by the present emergency, and has considered bills\\r\\nbefore Congress pertaining to the army.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Historical Branch of the General Staff was organized March 5, 1918,\\r\\nto collect and compile the records pertaining to the war under the\\r\\napproved policy, and satisfactory progress is being made. To June 30,\\r\\n1918, 67,022 photographs and 2,590 feet of motion-picture film had been\\r\\nreceived.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inventions Section was organized April 16, 1918. This section has\\r\\ntaken over from the different agencies of the government the preliminary\\r\\nconsideration of inventions and ideas of inventions of a military\\r\\nnature, with a view to placing before the proper bureaus of the War\\r\\nDepartment those having sufficient military value to warrant test and\\r\\ndevelopment at the expense of the government. From April 16, 1918, to\\r\\nJune 30, 1918, 4,645 cases were handled, a number of which were of\\r\\nexceptional merit and have already been put to use....\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief of Staff has as his principal assistant Major-General Frank\\r\\nMcIntyre, United States army, who acts as executive officer for the\\r\\nGeneral Staff and also for the Chief of Staff in his absence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeside the General Staff divisions which have been referred to in the\\r\\nforegoing, there has been established in the General Staff a Morale\\r\\nSection, under charge of Brigadier-General E. L. Munson, United States\\r\\narmy, which has for its object primarily the stimulation of morale\\r\\nthroughout the army, and maintaining a close connection and liaison with\\r\\nsimilar activities in civil life. This section had only gotten fairly\\r\\ninto operation before the signing of the armistice, but had already\\r\\nshown its value as a military asset.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother important addition to the organization of the General Staff has\\r\\nbeen the establishment of a Personnel Section, under charge of\\r\\nBrigadier-General P. P. Bishop, United States army. In this section has\\r\\nbeen consolidated the handling of appointments, promotions, and\\r\\ncommissions of the entire official personnel of the United States army.\\r\\nThis section has proved to be of the greatest value and has come to\\r\\nstay.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe signing of the armistice has interrupted the conclusion of the\\r\\norganization now under way for the consolidation of Procurement and\\r\\nStorage under the Director of Purchase, Storage, and Traffic, but the\\r\\nprinciple is sound from the standpoint of organization and extremely\\r\\neconomical in its results.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe supply of officers for the very large military program has been\\r\\nthroughout one of the most important problems which confronted the\\r\\nGeneral Staff. I have already indicated in the statement of the\\r\\nfunctions of the Operations Division of the General Staff the\\r\\norganization of central training camps for officers throughout the\\r\\nUnited States. When, however, we embarked upon the final program of\\r\\nplacing eighty divisions in France and eighteen at home by June 30,\\r\\n1919, which involved an army of approximately 4,800,000, the problem of\\r\\nthe supply of officers became so serious that an understanding was\\r\\nobtained with the great mass of educational institutions throughout the\\r\\nUnited States, resulting in the development of the Student Army Training\\r\\nCorps. This scheme absorbed for military purposes the academic plants of\\r\\nsome 518 colleges and universities throughout the country, and for\\r\\nvocational training in the army embraced some eighty more. This corps\\r\\nwas put under the charge of Brigadier-General Robert I. Rees, United\\r\\nStates army, and in its development we have had the energetic\\r\\ncooperation of college presidents and responsible college authorities\\r\\nthroughout the entire United States. At the same time, in order to\\r\\nincrease the supply of officers, the course at West Point was cut down\\r\\nto one year\\'s intensive training, with the idea of placing at the\\r\\ndisposal of the government 1,000 officers a year graduated from that\\r\\nextremely efficient plant rather than the graduation of about 200, which\\r\\nhad been the case previously throughout the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe separation of the Air Service from the Signal Corps, under the\\r\\nprovisions of the Overman bill, and the establishment of a Bureau of\\r\\nMilitary Aeronautics, under Major-General William L. Kenly, United\\r\\nStates army, and of a Bureau of Aircraft Production, under Mr. John D.\\r\\nRyan, marked an extremely important step forward in the development of\\r\\nthis portion of the Military Establishment. The armistice closes out\\r\\nthis matter with the two branches of the Air Service in a state of\\r\\nmarked efficiency and establishes unquestionably the necessity for the\\r\\npermanent separation of the Air Service from the Signal Corps in the\\r\\nreorganization of the army.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this period another new agency created in the War Department by\\r\\nExecutive order was the office of the Chief of Field Artillery. This\\r\\noffice has been filled by Major-General William J. Snow, United States\\r\\narmy. This establishment was accompanied by the creation in the American\\r\\nExpeditionary Force in France of the office of Chief of Artillery on\\r\\nGeneral Pershing\\'s staff, having similar relation to all the artillery\\r\\nof the Expeditionary Force which the Chief of Field Artillery has toward\\r\\nthe mobile artillery at home. The work of this office has been\\r\\naccompanied by a marked increase in the efficiency of the training\\r\\nsystem in the various Field Artillery camps, and the office itself has\\r\\nproved to be of distinct value.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have directed the divisions of the General Staff concerned to study\\r\\nand submit for your consideration a plan for the reorganization of our\\r\\narmy, which will take advantage of our experience in this war, which has\\r\\nbrought about many changes in organization of all arms of the service,\\r\\nand has developed new arms not known when the war started. The Air\\r\\nService, the Tank Corps, the development of heavy mobile artillery, the\\r\\nproper organization of divisions, corps, and armies, all will be set\\r\\nforth in the scheme which will be submitted to you with the\\r\\nrecommendation that it be transmitted for the consideration of Congress.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conduct of the American troops in France, their progressive\\r\\ndevelopment in military experience and ability, the fine staff work, and\\r\\nthe modesty and gallantry of the individual soldier is a matter of pride\\r\\nto all Americans. General Pershing and his command have earned the\\r\\nthanks of the American people.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe work of General Tasker H. Bliss as military representative of the\\r\\nWar Department with the American Section of the Supreme War Council at\\r\\nVersailles has been of the greatest value to the War Department.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot close this report without making of record the appreciation of\\r\\nthe War Department of the work of the many trained and patriotic\\r\\nofficers of the army whom the destiny of war did not call to France.\\r\\nThese officers, forced to remain behind in the United States by the\\r\\nimperative necessity of having trained men to keep the machine moving,\\r\\nhave kept up their work with such intelligence, zeal, and devotion to\\r\\nduty as to show a high order of patriotism. The officers and men who\\r\\nhave not been able on account of the armistice to be transported to\\r\\nFrance deserve also, with their comrades in France, the thanks of the\\r\\nAmerican people.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER LVIII\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL PERSHING\\'S OWN STORY\\r\\n[Footnote: From General Pershing\\'s official report to the Secretary of\\r\\nWar. November 20, 1918]\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately upon receiving my orders I selected a small staff and\\r\\nproceeded to Europe in order to become familiar with conditions at the\\r\\nearliest possible moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe warmth of our reception in England and France was only equaled by\\r\\nthe readiness of the commanders-in-chief of the veteran armies of the\\r\\nAllies and their staffs to place their experience at our disposal. In\\r\\nconsultation with them the most effective means of co-operation of\\r\\neffort was considered. With French and British armies at their maximum\\r\\nstrength, and all efforts to dispossess the enemy from his firmly\\r\\nintrenched positions in Belgium and France failed, it was necessary to\\r\\nplan for an American force adequate to turn the scale in favor of the\\r\\nAllies. Taking account of the strength of the central powers at that\\r\\ntime, the immensity of the problem which confronted us could hardly be\\r\\noverestimated. The first requisite being an organization that could give\\r\\nintelligent direction to effort, the formation of a General Staff\\r\\noccupied my early attention.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGENERAL STAFF\\r\\n\\r\\nA well-organized General Staff through which the commander exercises his\\r\\nfunctions is essential to a successful modern army. However capable our\\r\\ndivision, our battalion, and our companies as such, success would be\\r\\nimpossible without thoroughly coordinated endeavor. A General Staff\\r\\nbroadly organized and trained for war had not hitherto existed in our\\r\\narmy. Under the Commander-in-Chief, this staff must carry out the policy\\r\\nand direct the details of administration, supply, preparation, and\\r\\noperations of the army as a whole, with all special branches and bureaus\\r\\nsubject to its control. As models to aid us we had the veteran French\\r\\nGeneral Staff and the experience of the British who had similarly formed\\r\\nan organization to meet the demands of a great army. By selecting from\\r\\neach the features best adapted to our basic organization, and fortified\\r\\nby our own early experience in the war, the development of our great\\r\\nGeneral Staff system was completed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe General Staff is naturally divided into five groups, each with its\\r\\nchief who is an assistant to the Chief of the General Staff. G. 1 is in\\r\\ncharge of organization and equipment of troops, replacements, tonnage,\\r\\npriority of overseas shipment, the auxiliary welfare association and\\r\\ncognate subjects; G. 2 has censorship, enemy intelligence, gathering and\\r\\ndisseminating information, preparation of maps, and all similar\\r\\nsubjects; G. 3 is charged with all strategic studies and plans, movement\\r\\nof troops, and the supervision of combat operations; G. 4 coordinates\\r\\nimportant questions of supply, construction, transport arrangements for\\r\\ncombat, and of the operations of the service of supply, and of\\r\\nhospitalization and the evacuation of the sick and wounded; G. 5\\r\\nsupervises the various schools and has general direction and\\r\\ncoordination of education and training.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Chief of Staff was Col. (now Maj.-Gen.) James G. Harbord, who\\r\\nwas succeeded in March, 1918, by Maj.-Gen. James W. McAndrew. To these\\r\\nofficers, to the deputy chief of staff, and to the assistant chiefs of\\r\\nstaff, who, as heads of sections, aided them, great credit is due for\\r\\nthe results obtained not only in perfecting the General Staff\\r\\norganization but in applying correct principles to the multiplicity of\\r\\nproblems that have arisen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nORGANIZATION AND TRAINING\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a thorough consideration of allied organizations it was decided\\r\\nthat our combat division should consist of four regiments of infantry of\\r\\n3,000 men, with three battalions to regiment and four companies of 250\\r\\nmen each to a battalion, and of an artillery brigade of three regiments,\\r\\na machine-gun battalion, an engineer regiment, a trench-mortar battery,\\r\\na signal battalion, wagon trains, and the headquarters staffs and\\r\\nmilitary police. These, with medical and other units, made a total of\\r\\nover 28,000 men, or practically double the size of a French or German\\r\\ndivision. Each corps would normally consist of six divisions--four\\r\\ncombat and one depot and one replacement division--and also two\\r\\nregiments of cavalry, and each army of from three to five corps.  With\\r\\nfour divisions fully trained, a corps could take over an American sector\\r\\nwith two divisions in line and two in reserve, with the depot and\\r\\nreplacement divisions prepared to fill the gaps in the ranks.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur purpose was to prepare an integral American force, which should be\\r\\nable to take the offensive in every respect. Accordingly, the\\r\\ndevelopment of a self-reliant infantry by thorough drill in the use of\\r\\nthe rifle and in the tactics of open warfare was always uppermost. The\\r\\nplan of training after arrival in France allowed a division one month\\r\\nfor acclimatization and instruction in small units from battalions down,\\r\\na second month in quiet trench sectors by battalion, and a third month\\r\\nafter it came out of the trenches when it should be trained as a\\r\\ncomplete division in war of movement....\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nARTILLERY, AIRPLANES, AND TANKS\\r\\n\\r\\nOur entry into the war found us with few of the auxiliaries necessary\\r\\nfor its conduct in the modern sense. Among our most important\\r\\ndeficiencies in material were artillery, aviation, and tanks. In order\\r\\nto meet our requirements as rapidly as possible, we accepted the offer\\r\\nof the French Government to provide us with the necessary artillery\\r\\nequipment of seventy-fives, one fifty-five millimeter howitzers, and one\\r\\nfifty-five G P F guns from their own factories for thirty divisions. The\\r\\nwisdom of this course is fully demonstrated by the fact that, although\\r\\nwe soon began the manufacture of these classes of guns at home, there\\r\\nwere no guns of the calibers mentioned manufactured in America on our\\r\\nfront at the date the armistice was signed. The only guns of these types\\r\\nproduced at home thus far received in France are 109 seventy-five\\r\\nmillimeter guns.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn aviation we were in the same situation, and here again the French\\r\\nGovernment came to our aid until our own aviation program should be\\r\\nunder way. We obtained from the French the necessary planes for training\\r\\nour personnel, and they have provided us with a total of 2,676 pursuit,\\r\\nobservation, and bombing planes. The first airplanes received from home\\r\\narrived in May, and altogether we have received 1,379. The first\\r\\nAmerican squadron completely equipped by American production, including\\r\\nairplanes, crossed the German lines on August 7, 1918. As to tanks, we\\r\\nwere also compelled to rely upon the French. Here, however, we were less\\r\\nfortunate, for the reason that the French production could barely meet\\r\\nthe requirements of their own armies.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should be fully realized that the French Government has always taken\\r\\na most liberal attitude and has been most anxious to give us every\\r\\npossible assistance in meeting our deficiencies in these as well as in\\r\\nother respects. Our dependence upon France for artillery, aviation, and\\r\\ntanks was, of course, due to the fact that our industries had not been\\r\\nexclusively devoted to military production. All credit is due our own\\r\\nmanufacturers for their efforts to meet our requirements, as at the time\\r\\nthe armistice was signed we were able to look forward to the early\\r\\nsupply of practically all our necessities from our own factories.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe welfare of the troops touches my responsibility, as\\r\\nCommander-in-Chief to the mothers and fathers and kindred of the men who\\r\\ncame to France in the impressionable period of youth. They could not\\r\\nhave the privilege accorded European soldiers during their periods of\\r\\nleave of visiting their families and renewing their home ties. Fully\\r\\nrealizing that the standard of conduct that should be established for\\r\\nthem must have a permanent influence in their lives and on the character\\r\\nof their future citizenship, the Red Cross, the Young Men\\'s Christian\\r\\nAssociation, Knights of Columbus, the Salvation Army, and the Jewish\\r\\nWelfare Board, as auxiliaries in this work, were encouraged in every\\r\\npossible way. The fact that our soldiers, in a land of different customs\\r\\nand language, have borne themselves in a manner in keeping with the\\r\\ncause for which they fought, is due not only to the efforts in their\\r\\nbehalf but much more to other high ideals, their discipline, and their\\r\\ninnate sense of self-respect. It should be recorded, however, that the\\r\\nmembers of these welfare societies have been untiring in their desire to\\r\\nbe of real service to our officers and men. The patriotic devotion of\\r\\nthese representative men and women has given a new significance to the\\r\\nGolden Rule, and we owe to them a debt of gratitude that can never be\\r\\nrepaid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCOMBAT OPERATIONS\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring our periods of training in the trenches some of our divisions had\\r\\nengaged the enemy in local combats, the most important of which was\\r\\nSeicheprey by the Twenty-sixth on April 20th, in the Toul sector, but\\r\\nnone had participated in action as a unit. The First Division, which had\\r\\npassed through the preliminary stages of training, had gone to the\\r\\ntrenches for its first period of instruction at the end of October and\\r\\nby March 21st, when the German offensive in Picardy began, we had four\\r\\ndivisions with experience in the trenches, all of which were equal to\\r\\nany demands of battle action. The crisis which this offensive developed\\r\\nwas such that our occupation of an American sector must be postponed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 28th I placed at the disposal of Marshal Foch, who had been\\r\\nagreed upon as Commander-in-Chief of the Allied armies, all of our\\r\\nforces to be used as he might decide. At his request the First division\\r\\nwas transferred from the Toul sector to a position in reserve at\\r\\nChaumont en Vexin. As German superiority in numbers required prompt\\r\\naction, an agreement was reached at the Abbeville conference of the\\r\\nAllied premiers and commanders and myself on May 2d by which British\\r\\nshipping was to transport ten American divisions to the British army\\r\\narea, where they were to be trained and equipped, and additional British\\r\\nshipping was to be provided for as many divisions as possible for use\\r\\nelsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 26th the First Division had gone into the line in the\\r\\nMontdidier salient on the Picardy battle front. Tactics had been\\r\\nsuddenly revolutionized to those of open warfare, and our men, confident\\r\\nof the results of their training, were eager for the test. On the\\r\\nmorning of May 28th this division attacked the commanding German\\r\\nposition in its front, taking with splendid dash the town of Cantigny\\r\\nand all other objectives, which were organized and held steadfastly\\r\\nagainst vicious counter-attacks and galling artillery fire. Although\\r\\nlocal, this brilliant action had an electrical effect, as it\\r\\ndemonstrated our fighting qualities under extreme battle conditions, and\\r\\nalso that the enemy\\'s troops were not altogether invincible.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Germans\\' Aisne offensive, which began on May 27th, had advanced\\r\\nrapidly toward the River Marne and Paris, and the Allies faced a crisis\\r\\nequally as grave as that of the Picardy offensive in March. Again every\\r\\navailable man was placed at Marshal Foch\\'s disposal, and the Third\\r\\nDivision, which had just come from its preliminary training in the\\r\\ntrenches, was hurried to the Marne. Its motorized machine-gun battalion\\r\\npreceded the other units and successfully held the bridge-head at the\\r\\nMarne, opposite Chateau-Thierry.  The Second Division, in reserve near\\r\\nMontdidier, was sent by motor trucks and other available transport to\\r\\ncheck the progress of the enemy toward Paris. The division attacked and\\r\\nretook the town and railroad station at Bouresches and sturdily held its\\r\\nground against the enemy\\'s best guard divisions. In the battle of\\r\\nBelleau Wood, which followed, our men proved their superiority and\\r\\ngained a strong tactical position, with far greater loss to the enemy\\r\\nthan to ourselves. On July 1st, before the Second was relieved, it\\r\\ncaptured the village of Vaux with most splendid precision.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile our Second Corps, under Maj.-Gen. George W. Read, had been\\r\\norganized for the command of our divisions with the British, which were\\r\\nheld back in training areas or assigned to second-line defenses. Five of\\r\\nthe ten divisions were withdrawn from the British area in June, three to\\r\\nrelieve divisions in Lorraine and the Vosges and two to the Paris area\\r\\nto join the group of American divisions which stood between the city and\\r\\nany farther advance of the enemy in that direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great June-July troop movement from the States was well under way,\\r\\nand, although these troops were to be given some preliminary training\\r\\nbefore being put into action, their very presence warranted the use of\\r\\nall the older divisions in the confidence that we did not lack reserves.\\r\\nElements of the Forty-second Division were in the line east of Rheims\\r\\nagainst the German offensive of July 15th, and held their ground\\r\\nunflinchingly. On the right flank of this offensive four companies of\\r\\nthe Twenty-eighth Division were in position in face of the advancing\\r\\nwaves of the German infantry. The Third Division was holding the bank of\\r\\nthe Marne from the bend east of the mouth of the Surmelin to the west of\\r\\nMezy, opposite Chateau-Thierry, where a large force of German infantry\\r\\nsought to force a passage under support of powerful artillery\\r\\nconcentrations and under cover of smoke screens. A single regiment of\\r\\nthe Third wrote one of the most brilliant pages in our military annals\\r\\non this occasion. It prevented the crossing at certain points on its\\r\\nfront while, on either flank, the Germans, who had gained a footing,\\r\\npressed forward. Our men, firing in three directions, met the German\\r\\nattacks with counter-attacks at critical points and succeeded in\\r\\nthrowing two German divisions into complete confusion, capturing 600\\r\\nprisoners.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great force of the German Chateau-Thierry offensive established the\\r\\ndeep Marne salient, but the enemy was taking chances, and the\\r\\nvulnerability of this pocket to attack might be turned to his\\r\\ndisadvantage. Seizing this opportunity to support my conviction, every\\r\\ndivision with any sort of training was made available for use in a\\r\\ncounter-offensive. The place of honor in the thrust toward Soissons on\\r\\nJuly 18th was given to our First and Second divisions in company with\\r\\nchosen French divisions. Without the usual brief warning of a\\r\\npreliminary bombardment, the massed French and American artillery,\\r\\nfiring by the map, laid down its rolling barrage at dawn while the\\r\\ninfantry began its charge. The tactical handling of our troops under\\r\\nthese trying conditions was excellent throughout the action. The enemy\\r\\nbrought up large numbers of reserves and made a stubborn defense both\\r\\nwith machine guns and artillery, but through five days\\' fighting the\\r\\nFirst Division continued to advance until it had gained the heights\\r\\nabove Soissons and captured the village of Berzy-le-sec. The Second\\r\\nDivision took Beau Repaire farm and Vierzy in a very rapid advance and\\r\\nreached a position in front of Tigny at the end of its second day. These\\r\\ntwo divisions captured 7,000 prisoners and over 100 pieces of artillery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Twenty-sixth Division, which, with a French division, was under\\r\\ncommand of our First Corps, acted as a pivot of the movement toward\\r\\nSoissons. On the 18th it took the village of Torcy while the Third\\r\\nDivision was crossing the Marne in pursuit of the retiring enemy. The\\r\\nTwenty-sixth attacked again on the 21st, and the enemy withdrew past the\\r\\nChateau-Thierry-Soissons road. The Third Division, continuing its\\r\\nprogress, took the heights of Mont St. Pere and the villages of\\r\\nCharteves and Jaulgonne in the face of both machine-gun and artillery\\r\\nfire.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 24th, after the Germans had fallen back from Trugny and Epieds,\\r\\nour Forty-second Division, which had been brought over from the\\r\\nChampagne, relieved the Twenty-sixth and, fighting its way through the\\r\\nForet de Fere, overwhelmed the nest of machine guns in its path. By the\\r\\n27th it had reached the Ourcq, whence the Third and Fourth divisions\\r\\nwere already advancing, while the French divisions with which we were\\r\\nco-operating were moving forward at other points.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Third Division had made its advance into Roncheres Wood on the 29th\\r\\nand was relieved for rest by a brigade of the Thirty-second. The\\r\\nForty-second and Thirty-second undertook the task of conquering the\\r\\nheights beyond Cierges, the Forty-second capturing Sergy and the\\r\\nThirty-second capturing Hill 230, both American divisions joining in the\\r\\npursuit of the enemy to the Vesle, and thus the operation of reducing\\r\\nthe salient was finished. Meanwhile the Forty-second was relieved by the\\r\\nFourth at Chery-Chartreuve, and the Thirty-second by the Twenty-eighth,\\r\\nwhile the Seventy-seventh Division took up a position on the Vesle. The\\r\\noperations of these divisions on the Vesle were under the Third Corps,\\r\\nMaj.-Gen. Robert L. Bullard, commanding.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBATTLE OF ST. MIHIEL\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the reduction of the Marne salient we could look forward to the\\r\\nconcentration of our divisions in our own zone. In view of the\\r\\nforthcoming operation against the St. Mihiel salient, which had long\\r\\nbeen planned as our first offensive action on a large scale, the First\\r\\nArmy was organized on August 10th under my personal command. While\\r\\nAmerican units had held different divisional and corps sectors along the\\r\\nwestern front, there had not been up to this time, for obvious reasons,\\r\\na distinct American sector; but, in view of the important parts the\\r\\nAmerican forces were now to play, it was necessary to take over a\\r\\npermanent portion of the line. Accordingly, on August 30th, the line\\r\\nbeginning at Port sur Seille, east of the Moselle and extending to the\\r\\nwest through St. Mihiel, thence north to a point opposite Verdun, was\\r\\nplaced under my command. The American sector was afterwards extended\\r\\nacross the Meuse to the western edge of the Argonne Forest, and included\\r\\nthe Second Colonial French, which held the point of the salient, and the\\r\\nSeventeenth French Corps, which occupied the heights above Verdun.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe preparation for a complicated operation against the formidable\\r\\ndefenses in front of us included the assembling of divisions and of\\r\\ncorps and army artillery, transport, aircraft, tanks, ambulances, the\\r\\nlocation of hospitals, and the molding together of all of the elements\\r\\nof a great modern army with its own railheads, supplied directly by our\\r\\nown Service of Supply. The concentration for this operation, which was\\r\\nto be a surprise, involved the movement, mostly at night, of\\r\\napproximately 600,000 troops, and required for its success the most\\r\\ncareful attention to every detail.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph]\\r\\n  Copyright Committee on Public Information.\\r\\n  THE AMERICAN COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF IN THE FIELD\\r\\n  Photograph of General John J.

Our heavy guns\\r\\nwere able to reach Metz and to interfere seriously with German rail\\r\\nmovements. The French Independent Air Force was placed under my command\\r\\nwhich, together with the British bombing squadrons and our air forces,\\r\\ngave us the largest assembly of aviation that had ever been engaged in\\r\\none operation on the western front.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Les Eparges around the nose of the salient at St. Mihiel to the\\r\\nMoselle River the line was roughly forty miles long and situated on\\r\\ncommanding ground greatly strengthened by artificial defenses. Our First\\r\\nCorps (Eighty-second, Ninetieth, Fifth, and Second divisions) under\\r\\ncommand of Major-General Hunter Liggett, restrung its right on\\r\\nPont-a-Mousson, with its left joining our Third Corps (the Eighty-ninth,\\r\\nForty-second, and First divisions), under Major-General Joseph T.\\r\\nDickman, in line to Xivray, were to swing in toward Vigneulles on the\\r\\npivot of the Moselle River for the initial assault. From Xivray to\\r\\nMouilly the Second Colonial French Corps was in line in the center and\\r\\nour Fifth Corps, under command of Major-General George H. Cameron, with\\r\\nour Twenty-sixth Division and a French division at the western base of\\r\\nthe salient, were to attack three difficult hills--Les Eparges, Combres,\\r\\nand Amaramthe. Our First Corps had in reserve the Seventy-eighth\\r\\nDivision, our Fourth Corps the Third Division, and our First Army the\\r\\nThirty-fifth and Ninety-first Divisions, with the Eightieth and\\r\\nThirty-third available. It should be understood that our corps\\r\\norganizations are very elastic, and that we have at no time had\\r\\npermanent assignments of divisions to corps.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter four hours\\' artillery preparation, the seven American divisions in\\r\\nthe front line advanced at 5 A. M., on September 12th, assisted by a\\r\\nlimited number of tanks manned partly by Americans and partly by the\\r\\nFrench. These divisions, accompanied by groups of wire cutters and\\r\\nothers armed with bangalore torpedoes, went through the successive bands\\r\\nof barbed wire that protected the enemy\\'s front line and support\\r\\ntrenches, in irresistible waves on schedule time, breaking down all\\r\\ndefense of an enemy demoralized by the great volume of our artillery\\r\\nfire and our sudden approach out of the fog.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur First Corps advanced to Thiaucourt, while our Fourth Corps curved\\r\\nback to the southwest through Nonsard. The Second Colonial French Corps\\r\\nmade the slight advance required of it on very difficult ground, and the\\r\\nFifth Corps took its three ridges and repulsed a counter-attack. A rapid\\r\\nmarch brought reserve regiments of a division of the Fifth Corps into\\r\\nVigneulles in the early morning, where it linked up with patrols of our\\r\\nFourth Corps, closing the salient and forming a new line west of\\r\\nThiaucourt to Vigneulles and beyond Fresnes-en-Woevre. At the cost of\\r\\nonly 7,000 casualties, mostly light, we had taken 16,000 prisoners and\\r\\n443 guns, a great quantity of material, released the inhabitants of many\\r\\nvillages from enemy domination, and established our lines in a position\\r\\nto threaten Metz. This signal success of the American First Army in its\\r\\nfirst offensive was of prime importance. The Allies found they had a\\r\\nformidable army to aid them, and the enemy learned finally that he had\\r\\none to reckon with.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMEUSE-ARGONNE OFFENSIVE, FIRST PHASE\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the day after we had taken the St. Mihiel salient, much of our corps\\r\\nand army artillery which had operated at St. Mihiel, and our divisions\\r\\nin reserve at other points, were already on the move toward the area\\r\\nback of the line between the Meuse River and the western edge of the\\r\\nforest of Argonne. With the exception of St. Mihiel, the old German\\r\\nfront line from Switzerland to the east of Rheims was still intact. In\\r\\nthe general attack all along the line, the operation assigned the\\r\\nAmerican army as the hinge of this Allied offensive was directed toward\\r\\nthe important railroad communications of the German armies through\\r\\nMezieres and Sedan. The enemy must hold fast to this part of his lines\\r\\nor the withdrawal of his forces with four years\\' accumulation of plants\\r\\nand material would be dangerously imperiled.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German army had as yet shown no demoralization and, while the mass\\r\\nof its troops had suffered in morale, its first-class divisions, and\\r\\nnotably its machine-gun defense, were exhibiting remarkable tactical\\r\\nefficiency as well as courage. The German General Staff was fully aware\\r\\nof the consequences of a success on the Meuse-Argonne line. Certain that\\r\\nhe would do everything in his power to oppose us, the action was planned\\r\\nwith as much secrecy as possible and was undertaken with the\\r\\ndetermination to use all our divisions in forcing decision. We expected\\r\\nto draw the best German divisions to our front and to consume them while\\r\\nthe enemy was held under grave apprehension lest our attack should break\\r\\nhis line, which it was our firm purpose to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur right flank was protected by the Meuse, while our left embraced the\\r\\nArgonne Forest whose ravines, hills, and elaborate defense screened by\\r\\ndense thickets had been generally considered impregnable. Our order of\\r\\nbattle from right to left was the Third Corps from the Meuse to\\r\\nMalancourt, with the Thirty-third, Eightieth, and Fourth divisions in\\r\\nline, and the Third Division as corps reserve; the Fifth Corps from\\r\\nMalancourt to Vauquois, with Seventy-ninth, Eighty-seventh, and\\r\\nNinety-first divisions in line, and the Thirty-second in corps reserve;\\r\\nand the First Corps, from Vauquois to Vienne le Chateau, with\\r\\nThirty-fifth, Twenty-eighth, and Seventy-seventh divisions in line, and\\r\\nthe Ninety-second in corps reserve. The army reserve consisted of the\\r\\nFirst, Twenty-ninth, and Eighty-second divisions.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the night of September 25th our troops quietly took the place of the\\r\\nFrench who thinly held the line in this sector which had long been\\r\\ninactive. In the attack which began on the 26th we drove through the\\r\\nbarbed wire entanglements and the sea of shell craters across No Man\\'s\\r\\nLand, mastering the first-line defenses. Continuing on the 27th and\\r\\n28th, against machine guns and artillery of an increasing number of\\r\\nenemy reserve divisions, we penetrated to a depth of from three to seven\\r\\nmiles, and took the village of Montfaucon and its commanding hill and\\r\\nExermont, Gercourt, Cuisy, Septsarges, Malancourt, Ivoiry, Epinonville,\\r\\nCharpentry, Very, and other villages. East of the Meuse one of our\\r\\ndivisions, which was with the Second Colonial French Corps, captured\\r\\nMarcheville and Rieville, giving further protection to the flank of our\\r\\nmain body. We had taken 10,000 prisoners, we had gained our point of\\r\\nforcing the battle into the open and were prepared for the enemy\\'s\\r\\nreaction, which was bound to come as he had good roads and ample\\r\\nrailroad facilities for bringing up his artillery and reserves.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the chill rain of dark nights our engineers had to build new roads\\r\\nacross spongy, shell-torn areas, repair broken roads beyond No Man\\'s\\r\\nLand, and build bridges. Our gunners, with no thought of sleep, put\\r\\ntheir shoulders to wheels and dragropes to bring their guns through the\\r\\nmire in support of the infantry, now under the increasing fire of the\\r\\nenemy\\'s artillery. Our attack had taken the enemy by surprise, but,\\r\\nquickly recovering himself, he began to fire counter-attacks in strong\\r\\nforce, supported by heavy bombardments, with large quantities of gas.\\r\\nFrom September 28th until October 4th we maintained the offensive\\r\\nagainst patches of woods defended by snipers and continuous lines of\\r\\nmachine guns, and pushed forward our guns and transport, seizing\\r\\nstrategical points in preparation for further attacks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOTHER UNITS WITH ALLIES\\r\\n\\r\\nOther divisions attached to the Allied armies were doing their part. It\\r\\nwas the fortune of our Second Corps, composed of the Twenty-seventh and\\r\\nThirtieth divisions, which had remained with the British, to have a\\r\\nplace of honor in co-operation with the Australian Corps, on September\\r\\n29th and October 1st, in the assault on the Hindenburg line where the\\r\\nSt. Quentin Canal passes through a tunnel under a ridge. The Thirtieth\\r\\nDivision speedily broke through the main line of defense for all its\\r\\nobjectives, while the Twenty-seventh pushed on impetuously through the\\r\\nmain line until some of its elements reached Gouy. In the midst of the\\r\\nmaze of trenches and shell craters and under cross-fire from machine\\r\\nguns the other elements fought desperately against odds. In this and in\\r\\nlater actions, from October 6th to October 19th, our Second Corps\\r\\ncaptured over 6,000 prisoners and advanced over thirteen miles. The\\r\\nspirit and aggressiveness of these divisions have been highly praised by\\r\\nthe British army commander under whom they served.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 2d to 9th our Second and Thirty-sixth divisions were sent to\\r\\nassist the French in an important attack against the old German\\r\\npositions before Rheims. The Second conquered the complicated defense\\r\\nworks on their front against a persistent defense worthy of the grimmest\\r\\nperiod of trench warfare and attacked the strongly held wooded hill of\\r\\nBlanc Mont, which they captured in a second assault, sweeping over it\\r\\nwith consummate dash and skill. This division then repulsed strong\\r\\ncounter-attacks before the village and cemetery of Ste. Etienne and took\\r\\nthe town, forcing the Germans to fall back from before Rheims and yield\\r\\npositions they had held since September, 1914. On October 9th the\\r\\nThirty-sixth Division relieved the Second and, in its first experience\\r\\nunder fire, withstood very severe artillery bombardment and rapidly took\\r\\nup the pursuit of the enemy, now retiring behind the Aisne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMEUSE-ARGONNE OFFENSIVE, SECOND PHASE\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Allied progress elsewhere cheered the efforts of our men in this\\r\\ncrucial contest as the German command threw in more and more first-class\\r\\ntroops to stop our advance. We made steady headway in the almost\\r\\nimpenetrable and strongly held Argonne Forest, for, despite this\\r\\nreinforcement, it was our army that was doing the driving. Our aircraft\\r\\nwas increasing in skill and numbers and forcing the issue, and our\\r\\ninfantry and artillery were improving rapidly with each new experience.\\r\\nThe replacements fresh from home were put into exhausted divisions with\\r\\nlittle time for training, but they had the advantage of serving beside\\r\\nmen who knew their business and who had almost become veterans over\\r\\nnight. The enemy had taken every advantage of the terrain, which\\r\\nespecially favored the defense, by a prodigal use of machine guns manned\\r\\nby highly-trained veterans and by using his artillery at short ranges.\\r\\nIn the face of such strong frontal positions we should have been unable\\r\\nto accomplish any progress according to previously accepted standards,\\r\\nbut I had every confidence in our aggressive tactics and the courage of\\r\\nour troops.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 4th the attack was renewed all along our front. The Third\\r\\nCorps tilting to the left followed the Brieulles-Cunel road; our Fifth\\r\\nCorps took Gesnes while the First Corps advanced for over two miles\\r\\nalong the irregular valley of the Aire River and in the wooded hills of\\r\\nthe Argonne that bordered the river, used by the enemy with all his art\\r\\nand weapons of defense. This sort of fighting continued against an enemy\\r\\nstriving to hold every foot of ground and whose very strong\\r\\ncounter-attacks challenged us at every point. On the 7th the First Corps\\r\\ncaptured Chatel-Chehery and continued along the river to Cornay. On the\\r\\neast of Meuse sector one of the two divisions co-operating with the\\r\\nFrench captured Consenvoye and the Haumont Woods. On the 9th the Fifth\\r\\nCorps, in its progress up the Aire, took Fleville, and the Third Corps,\\r\\nwhich had continuous fighting against odds, was working its way through\\r\\nBrieulles and Cunel. On the 10th we had cleared the Argonne Forest of\\r\\nthe enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now necessary to constitute a second army, and on October 9th the\\r\\nimmediate command of the First Army was turned over to\\r\\nLieutenant-General Hunter Liggett. The command of the Second Army, whose\\r\\ndivisions occupied a sector in the Woevre, was given to\\r\\nLieutenant-General Robert L. Bullard, who had been commander of the\\r\\nFirst Division and then of the Third Corps. Major-General Dickman was\\r\\ntransferred to the command of the First Corps, while the Fifth Corps was\\r\\nplaced under Major-General Charles P. Summerall, who had recently\\r\\ncommanded the First Division. Major-General John L. Hines, who had gone\\r\\nrapidly up from regimental to division commander, was assigned to the\\r\\nThird Corps. These four officers had been in France from the early days\\r\\nof the expedition and had learned their lessons in the school of\\r\\npractical warfare.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur constant pressure against the enemy brought day by day more\\r\\nprisoners, mostly survivors from machine-gun nests captured in fighting\\r\\nat close quarters. On October 18th there was very fierce fighting in the\\r\\nCaures Woods east of the Meuse and in the Ormont Woods. On the 14th the\\r\\nFirst Corps took St. Juvin, and the Fifth Corps, in hand-to-hand\\r\\nencounters, entered the formidable Kriemhilde line, where the enemy had\\r\\nhoped to check us indefinitely. Later the Fifth Corps penetrated further\\r\\nthe Kriemhilde line, and the First Corps took Champigneulles and the\\r\\nimportant town of Grandpre. Our dogged offensive was wearing down the\\r\\nenemy, who continued desperately to throw his best troops against us,\\r\\nthus weakening his line in front of our Allies and making their advance\\r\\nless difficult.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDIVISIONS IN BELGIUM\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile we were not only able to continue the battle, but our\\r\\nThirty-seventh and Ninety-first divisions were hastily withdrawn from\\r\\nour front and dispatched to help the French army in Belgium. Detraining\\r\\nin the neighborhood of Ypres, these divisions advanced by rapid stages\\r\\nto the fighting line and were assigned to adjacent French corps. On\\r\\nOctober 31st, in continuation of the Flanders offensive, they attacked\\r\\nand methodically broke down all enemy resistance. On November 3d the\\r\\nThirty-seventh had completed its mission in dividing the enemy across\\r\\nthe Escaut River and firmly established itself along the east bank\\r\\nincluded in the division zone of action. By a clever flanking movement\\r\\ntroops of the Ninety-first Division captured Spitaals Bosschen, a\\r\\ndifficult wood extending across the central part of the division sector,\\r\\nreached the Escaut, and penetrated into the town of Audenarde. These\\r\\ndivisions received high commendation from their corps commanders for\\r\\ntheir dash and energy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMEUSE ARGONNE--LAST PHASE\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 23d the Third and Fifth corps pushed northward to the level of\\r\\nBantheville. While we continued to press forward and throw back the\\r\\nenemy\\'s violent counter-attacks with great loss to him, a regrouping of\\r\\nour forces was under way for the final assault. Evidences of loss of\\r\\nmorale by the enemy gave our men more confidence in attack and more\\r\\nfortitude in enduring the fatigue of incessant effort and the hardships\\r\\nof very inclement weather.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith comparatively well-rested divisions, the final advance in the\\r\\nMeuse-Argonne front was begun on November 1st. Our increased artillery\\r\\nforce acquitted itself magnificently in support of the advance, and the\\r\\nenemy broke before the determined infantry, which, by its persistent\\r\\nfighting of the past weeks and the dash of this attack, had overcome his\\r\\nwill to resist. The Third Corps took Aincreville, Doulcon, and\\r\\nAndevanne, and the Fifth Corps took Landres et St. Georges and pressed\\r\\nthrough successive lines of resistance to Bayonville and Chennery. On\\r\\nthe 2d the First Corps joined in the movement, which now became an\\r\\nimpetuous onslaught that could not be stayed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 3d advance troops surged forward in pursuit, some by motor\\r\\ntrucks, while the artillery pressed along the country roads close\\r\\nbehind. The First Corps reached Authe and Chatillon-Sur-Bar, the Fifth\\r\\nCorps, Fosse and Nouart, and the Third Corps Halles, penetrating the\\r\\nenemy\\'s line to a depth of twelve miles. Our large caliber guns had\\r\\nadvanced and were skillfully brought into position to fire upon the\\r\\nimportant lines at Montmedy, Longuyon, and Conflans. Our Third Corps\\r\\ncrossed the Meuse on the 5th and the other corps, in the full confidence\\r\\nthat the day was theirs, eagerly cleared the way of machine guns as they\\r\\nswept northward, maintaining complete coordination throughout. On the\\r\\n6th, a division of the First Corps reached a point on the Meuse opposite\\r\\nSedan, twenty-five miles from our line of departure. The strategical\\r\\ngoal which was our highest hope was gained. We had cut the enemy\\'s main\\r\\nline of communications, and nothing but surrender or an armistice could\\r\\nsave his army from complete disaster.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn all forty enemy divisions had been used against us in the\\r\\nMeuse-Argonne battle. Between September 26th and November 6th we took\\r\\n26,059 prisoners and 468 guns on this front. Our divisions engaged were\\r\\nthe First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Twenty-sixth, Twenty-eighth,\\r\\nTwenty-ninth, Thirty-second, Thirty-third, Thirty-fifth, Thirty-seventh,\\r\\nForty-second, Seventy-seventh, Seventy-eighth, Seventy-ninth,\\r\\nEightieth, Eighty-second, Eighty-ninth, Ninetieth, and Ninety-first.\\r\\nMany of our divisions remained in line for a length of time that\\r\\nrequired nerves of steel, while others were sent in again after only a\\r\\nfew days of rest. The First, Fifth, Twenty-sixth, Forty-second,\\r\\nSeventy-seventh, Eightieth, Eighty-ninth, and Ninetieth were in the line\\r\\ntwice. Although some of the divisions were fighting their first battle,\\r\\nthey soon became equal to the best.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOPERATIONS EAST OF THE MEUSE\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the three days preceding November 10th, the Third, the Second\\r\\nColonial, and the Seventeenth French corps fought a difficult struggle\\r\\nthrough the Meuse Hills south of Stenay and forced the enemy into the\\r\\nplain. Meanwhile, my plans for further use of the American forces\\r\\ncontemplated an advance between the Meuse and the Moselle in the\\r\\ndirection of Longwy by the First Army, while, at the same time, the\\r\\nSecond Army should assure the offensive toward the rich coal fields of\\r\\nBriey. These operations were to be followed by an offensive toward\\r\\nChateau-Salins east of the Moselle, thus isolating Metz. Accordingly,\\r\\nattacks on the American front had been ordered and that of the Second\\r\\nArmy was in progress on the morning of November 11th, when instructions\\r\\nwere received that hostilities should cease at 11 o\\'clock A. M.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment the line of the American sector, from right to left,\\r\\nbegan at Port-Sur-Seille, thence across the Moselle to Vandieres and\\r\\nthrough the Woevre to Bezonvaux in the foothills of the Meuse, thence\\r\\nalong to the foothills and through the northern edge of the Woevre\\r\\nforests to the Meuse at Mouzay, thence along the Meuse connecting with\\r\\nthe French under Sedan....\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are in Europe altogether, including a regiment and some sanitary\\r\\nunits with the Italian army and the organizations at Murmansk, also\\r\\nincluding those en route from the States, approximately 2,053,347 men,\\r\\nless our losses. Of this total there are in France 1,338,169 combatant\\r\\ntroops. Forty divisions have arrived, of which the infantry personnel of\\r\\nten have been used as replacements, leaving thirty divisions now in\\r\\nFrance organized into three armies of three corps each.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe losses of the Americans up to November 18th are: Killed and wounded,\\r\\n36,145; died of disease, 14,811; deaths unclassified, 2,204; wounded,\\r\\n179,625; prisoners, 2,163; missing, 1,160. We have captured about 41,000\\r\\nprisoners and 1,400 guns, howitzers and trench mortars....\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, I pay the supreme tribute to our officers and soldiers of the\\r\\nline. When I think of their heroism, their patience under hardships,\\r\\ntheir unflinching spirit of offensive action, I am filled with emotion\\r\\nwhich I am unable to express. Their deeds are immortal, and they have\\r\\nearned the eternal gratitude of our country.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER LIX\\r\\n\\r\\nPRESIDENT WILSON\\'S REVIEW OF THE WAR\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 2, 1918, just prior to sailing for Europe to take part in\\r\\nthe Peace Conference, President Wilson addressed Congress, reviewing the\\r\\nwork of the American people, soldiers, sailors and civilians, in the\\r\\nWorld War which had been brought to a successful conclusion on November\\r\\n11th. His speech, in part, follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The year that has elapsed since I last stood before you to fulfil my\\r\\nconstitutional duty to give to the Congress from time to time\\r\\ninformation on the state of the Union has been so crowded with great\\r\\nevents, great processes and great results that I cannot hope to give you\\r\\nan adequate picture of its transactions or of the far-reaching changes\\r\\nwhich have been wrought in the life of our Nation and of the world. You\\r\\nhave yourselves witnessed these things, as I have. It is too soon to\\r\\nassess them; and we who stand in the midst of them and are part of them\\r\\nare less qualified than men of another generation will be to say what\\r\\nthey mean or even what they have been. But some great outstanding facts\\r\\nare unmistakable and constitute in a sense part of the public business\\r\\nwith which it is our duty to deal. To state them is to set the stage for\\r\\nthe legislative and executive action which must grow out of them and\\r\\nwhich we have yet to shape and determine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A year ago we had sent 145,918 men overseas. Since then we have sent\\r\\n1,950,513, an average of 162,542 each month, the number in fact rising\\r\\nin May last to 245,951, in June to 278,760, in July to 307,182 and\\r\\ncontinuing to reach similar figures in August and September--in August\\r\\n289,570 and in September 257,438. No such movement of troops ever took\\r\\nplace before, across 3,000 miles of sea, followed by adequate equipment\\r\\nand supplies, and carried safely through extraordinary dangers of\\r\\nattack, dangers which were alike strange and infinitely difficult to\\r\\nguard against. In all this movement only 758 men were lost by enemy\\r\\nattacks, 630 of whom were upon a single English transport which was sunk\\r\\nnear the Orkney Islands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I need not tell you what lay back of this great movement of men and\\r\\nmaterial. It is not invidious to say that back of it lay a supporting\\r\\norganization of the industries of the country and of all its productive\\r\\nactivities more complete, more thorough in method and effective in\\r\\nresults, more spirited and unanimous in purpose and effort than any\\r\\nother great belligerent had ever been able to effect. We profited\\r\\ngreatly by the experience of the nations which had already been engaged\\r\\nfor nearly three years in the exigent and exacting business, their every\\r\\nresource and every proficiency taxed to the utmost. We were the pupils.\\r\\nBut we learned quickly and acted with a promptness and a readiness of\\r\\nco-operation that justify our great pride that we were able to serve the\\r\\nworld with unparalleled energy and quick accomplishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it is not the physical scale and executive efficiency of\\r\\npreparation, supply, equipment and dispatch that I would dwell upon, but\\r\\nthe mettle and quality of the officers and men we sent over and of the\\r\\nsailors who kept the seas, and the spirit of the Nation that stood\\r\\nbehind them. No soldiers, or sailors, ever proved themselves more\\r\\nquickly ready for the test of battle or acquitted themselves with more\\r\\nsplendid courage and achievement when put to the test. Those of us who\\r\\nplayed some part in directing the great processes by which the war was\\r\\npushed irresistibly forward to the final triumph may now forget all that\\r\\nand delight our thoughts with the story of what our men did. Their\\r\\nofficers understood the grim and exacting task they had undertaken and\\r\\nperformed with audacity, efficiency and unhesitating courage that touch\\r\\nthe story of convoy and battle with imperishable distinction at every\\r\\nturn, whether the enterprise were great or small--from their chiefs,\\r\\nPershing and Sims, down to the youngest lieutenant; and their men were\\r\\nworthy of them--such men as hardly need to be commanded, and go to their\\r\\nterrible adventure blithely and with the quick intelligence of those who\\r\\nknow just what it is they would accomplish. I am proud to be the\\r\\nfellow-countryman of men of such stuff and valor. Those of us who stayed\\r\\nat home did our duty: the war could not have been won or the gallant men\\r\\nwho fought it given their opportunity to win it otherwise; but for many\\r\\na long day we shall think ourselves \\'accursed we were not there, and\\r\\nhold our manhoods cheap while any speaks that fought\\' with these at St.\\r\\nMihiel or Thierry. The memory of those days of triumphant battle will go\\r\\nwith these fortunate men to their graves; and each will have his\\r\\nfavorite memory. \\'Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot, but he\\'ll\\r\\nremember with advantages what feats he did that day!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What we all thank God for with deepest gratitude is that our men went\\r\\nin force into the line of battle just at the critical moment, and threw\\r\\ntheir fresh strength into the ranks of freedom in time to turn the whole\\r\\ntide and sweep of the fateful struggle--turn it once for all, so that\\r\\nhenceforth it was back, back, back for their enemies, always back, never\\r\\nagain forward! After that it was only a scant four months before the\\r\\ncommanders of the central empires knew themselves beaten, and now their\\r\\nvery empires are in liquidation!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And throughout it all how fine the spirit of the Nation was; what unity\\r\\nof purpose, what untiring zeal! What elevation of purpose ran through\\r\\nall its splendid display of strength, its untiring accomplishment. I\\r\\nhave said that those of us who stayed at home to do the work of\\r\\norganization and supply will always wish that we had been with the men\\r\\nwhom we sustained by our labor; but we can never be ashamed. It has been\\r\\nan inspiring thing to be here in the midst of fine men who had turned\\r\\naside from every private interest of their own and devoted the whole of\\r\\ntheir trained capacity to the tasks that supplied the sinews of the\\r\\nwhole great undertaking! The patriotism, the unselfishness, the\\r\\nthoroughgoing devotion and distinguished capacity that marked their\\r\\ntoilsome labors, day after day, month after month, have made them fit\\r\\nmates and comrades of the men in the trenches and on the sea. And not\\r\\nthe men here in Washington only. They have but directed the vast\\r\\nachievement. Throughout innumerable factories, upon innumerable farms,\\r\\nin the depths of coal mines and iron mines and copper mines, wherever\\r\\nthe stuffs of industry were to be obtained and prepared, in the\\r\\nshipyards, on the railways, at the docks, on the sea, in every labor\\r\\nthat was needed to sustain the battle lines men have vied with each\\r\\nother to do their part and do it well. They can look any man-at-arms in\\r\\nthe face, and say, we also strove to win and gave the best that was in\\r\\nus to make our fleets and armies sure of their triumph!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what shall we say of the women--of their instant intelligence,\\r\\nquickening every task that they touched; their capacity for organization\\r\\nand co-operation, which gave their action discipline and enhanced the\\r\\neffectiveness of everything they attempted; their aptitude at tasks to\\r\\nwhich they had never before set their hands; their utter\\r\\nself-sacrificing alike in what they did and in what they gave? Their\\r\\ncontribution to the great result is beyond appraisal. They have added a\\r\\nnew luster to the annals of American womanhood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The least tribute we can pay them is to make them the equals of men in\\r\\npolitical rights as they have proved themselves their equals in every\\r\\nfield of practical work they have entered, whether for themselves or for\\r\\ntheir country. These great days of completed achievement would be sadly\\r\\nmarred were we to omit that act of justice. Besides the immense\\r\\npractical services they have rendered, the women of the country have\\r\\nbeen the moving spirits in the systematic economies by which our people\\r\\nhave voluntarily assisted to supply the suffering peoples of the world\\r\\nand the armies upon every front with food and everything else that we\\r\\nhad that might serve the common cause. The details of such a story can\\r\\nnever be fully written, but we carry them at our hearts and thank God\\r\\nthat we can say we are the kinsmen of such.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And now we are sure of the great triumph for which every sacrifice was\\r\\nmade. It has come, come in its completeness, and with the pride and\\r\\ninspiration of these days of achievement quick within us we turn to the\\r\\ntasks of peace again--a peace secure against the violence of\\r\\nirresponsible monarchs and ambitious military coteries and made ready\\r\\nfor a new order, for new foundations of justice and fair dealing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are about to give order and organization to this peace, not only for\\r\\nourselves, but for the other peoples of the world as well, so far as\\r\\nthey will suffer us to serve them. It is international justice that we\\r\\nseek, not domestic safety merely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So far as our domestic affairs are concerned the problem of our return\\r\\nto peace is a problem of economic and industrial readjustment. That\\r\\nproblem is less serious for us than it may turn out to be for the\\r\\nnations which have suffered the disarrangements and the losses of war\\r\\nlonger than we. Our people, moreover, do not wait to be coached and led.\\r\\nThey know their own business, are quick and resourceful at every\\r\\nreadjustment, definite in purpose and self-reliant in action. Any\\r\\nleading strings we might seek to put them in would speedily become\\r\\nhopelessly tangled because they would pay no attention to them and go\\r\\ntheir own way. All that we can do as their legislative and executive\\r\\nservants is to mediate the process of change here, there and elsewhere\\r\\nas we may. I have heard much counsel as to the plans that should be\\r\\nformed and personally conducted to a happy consummation, but from no\\r\\nquarter have I seen any general scheme of reconstruction emerge which I\\r\\nthought it likely we could force our spirited businessmen and\\r\\nself-reliant laborers to accept with due pliancy and obedience.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"While the war lasted we set up many agencies by which to direct the\\r\\nindustries of the country in the services it was necessary for them to\\r\\nrender, by which to make sure of an abundant supply of the materials\\r\\nneeded, by which to check undertakings that could for the time be\\r\\ndispensed with and stimulate those that were most serviceable in war, by\\r\\nwhich to gain for the purchasing departments of the government a certain\\r\\ncontrol over the prices of essential articles and materials, by which to\\r\\nrestrain trade with alien enemies, make the most of the available\\r\\nshipping and systematize financial transactions, both public and\\r\\nprivate, so that there would be no unnecessary conflict or confusion--by\\r\\nwhich, in short, to put every material energy of the country in harness\\r\\nto draw the common load and make of us one team in accomplishment of a\\r\\ngreat task.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But the moment we knew the armistice to have been signed we took the\\r\\nharness off. Raw materials upon which the government had kept its hand\\r\\nfor fear there should not be enough for the industries that supplied the\\r\\narmies have been released, and put into the general market again. Great\\r\\nindustrial plants whose whole output and machinery had been taken over\\r\\nfor the uses of the government have been set free to return to the uses\\r\\nto which they were put before the war. It has not been possible to\\r\\nremove so readily or so quickly the control of foodstuffs and of\\r\\nshipping, because the world has still to be fed from our granaries and\\r\\nthe ships are still needed to send supplies to our men oversea and to\\r\\nbring the men back as fast as the disturbed conditions on the other side\\r\\nof the water permit; but even there restraints are being relaxed as much\\r\\nas possible, and more and more as the weeks go by.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never before have there been agencies in existence in this country\\r\\nwhich knew so much of the field of supply of labor, and of industry as\\r\\nthe War Industries Board, the War Trade Board, the Labor Department, the\\r\\nFood Administration and the Fuel Administration have known since their\\r\\nlabors became thoroughly systematized; and they have not been isolated\\r\\nagencies; they have been directed by men which represented the permanent\\r\\ndepartments of the government and so have been the centers of unified\\r\\nand co-operative action. It has been the policy of the Executive,\\r\\ntherefore, since the armistice was assured (which is in effect a\\r\\ncomplete submission of the enemy) to put the knowledge of these bodies\\r\\nat the disposal of the businessmen of the country and to offer their\\r\\nintelligent mediation at every point and in every matter where it was\\r\\ndesired. It is surprising how fast the process of return to a peace\\r\\nfooting has moved in the three weeks since the fighting stopped. It\\r\\npromises to outrun any inquiry that may be instituted and any aid that\\r\\nmay be offered. It will not be easy to direct it any better than it will\\r\\ndirect itself. The American business man is of quick initiative....\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I welcome this occasion to announce to the Congress my purpose to join\\r\\nin Paris the representatives of the governments with which we have been\\r\\nassociated in the war against the Central Empires for the purpose of\\r\\ndiscussing with them the main features of the treaty of peace. I realize\\r\\nthe great inconveniences that will attend my leaving the country,\\r\\nparticularly at this time, but the conclusion that it was my paramount\\r\\nduty to go has been forced upon me by considerations which I hope will\\r\\nseem as conclusive to you as they have seemed to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Allied governments have accepted the bases of peace which I\\r\\noutlined to the Congress on the 8th of January last, as the Central\\r\\nEmpires also have, and very reasonably desire my personal counsel in\\r\\ntheir interpretation and application, and it is highly desirable that I\\r\\nshould give it, in order that the sincere desire of our government to\\r\\ncontribute without selfish purpose of any kind to settlements that will\\r\\nbe of common benefit to all the nations concerned may be made fully\\r\\nmanifest. The peace settlements which are now to be agreed upon are of\\r\\ntranscendent importance both to us and to the rest of the world, and I\\r\\nknow of no business or interest which should take precedence of them.\\r\\nThe gallant men of our armed forces on land and sea have consciously\\r\\nfought for the ideals which they knew to be the ideals of their country;\\r\\nI have sought to express those ideals; they have accepted my statements\\r\\nof them as the substance of their own thought and purpose, as the\\r\\nassociated governments have accepted them; I owe it to them to see to\\r\\nit, so far as in me lies, that no false or mistaken interpretation is\\r\\nput upon them, and no possible effort omitted to realize them. It is now\\r\\nmy duty to play my full part in making good what they offered their\\r\\nlife\\'s blood to obtain. I can think of no call to service which could\\r\\ntranscend this....\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May I not hope, gentlemen of the Congress, that in the delicate tasks I\\r\\nshall have to perform on the other side of the sea in my efforts truly\\r\\nand faithfully to interpret the principles and purposes of the country\\r\\nwe love, I may have the encouragement and the added strength of your\\r\\nunited support? I realize the magnitude and difficulty of the duty I am\\r\\nundertaking. I am poignantly aware of its grave responsibilities. I am\\r\\nthe servant of the Nation. I can have no private thought or purpose of\\r\\nmy own in performing such an errand. I go to give the best that is in me\\r\\nto the common settlements which I must now assist in arriving at in\\r\\nconference with the other working heads of the associated governments. I\\r\\nshall count upon your friendly countenance and encouragement. I shall\\r\\nnot be inaccessible. The cables and the wireless will render me\\r\\navailable for any counselor service you may desire of me, and I shall be\\r\\nhappy in the thought that I am constantly in touch with the weighty\\r\\nmatters of domestic policy with which we shall have to deal. I shall\\r\\nmake my absence as brief as possible and shall hope to return with the\\r\\nhappy assurance that it has been possible to translate into action the\\r\\ngreat ideals for which America has striven.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Photograph]\\r\\n  Copyright Harris and Ewing.\\r\\n  WOODROW WILSON\\r\\n  President of the United States during the whole course of the war and\\r\\n  Commander in-Chief of its army and navy.

       "'This is a popular narrative history of the world\\'s greatest war. Written frankly from the viewpoint of the United States and the Allies, it visualizes the bloodiest and most destructive conflict of all the ages from its remote causes to its glorious conclusion and beneficent results. The world-shaking rise of new democracies is set forth, and the enormous national and individual sacrifices producing that resurrection of human equality are detailed.  Two ideals have been before us in the preparation of this necessary work. These are simplicity and thoroughness. It is of no avail to describe the greatest of human events if the description is so confused that the reader loses interest. Thoroughness is an historical essential beyond price. So it is that official documents prepared in many instances upon the field of battle, and others taken from the files of the governments at war, are the basis of this work. Maps and photographs of unusual clearness and high authenticity illuminate the text. All that has gone into war making, into the regeneration of the world, are herein set forth with historical particularity. The stark horrors of Belgium, the blighting terrors of chemical warfare, the governmental restrictions placed upon hundreds of millions of civilians, the war sacrifices falling upon all the civilized peoples of earth, are in these pages.  It is a book that mankind can well read and treasure.    CHAPTER I  A WAR FOR INTERNATIONAL FREEDOM  \"My FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: The armistice was signed this morning. Everything for which America fought has been accomplished. The war thus comes to an end.\"  Speaking to the Congress and the people of the United States, President Wilson made this declaration on November 11, 1918. A few hours before he made this statement, Germany, the empire of blood and iron, had agreed to an armistice, terms of which were the hardest and most humiliating ever imposed upon a nation of the first class. It was the end of a war for which Germany had prepared for generations, a war bred of a philosophy that Might can take its toll of earth\\'s possessions, of human lives and liberties, when and where it will. That philosophy involved the cession to imperial Germany of the best years of young German manhood, the training of German youths to be killers of men. It involved the creation of a military caste, arrogant beyond all precedent, a caste that set its strength and pride against the righteousness of democracy, against the possession of wealth and bodily comforts, a caste that visualized itself as part of a power-mad Kaiser\\'s assumption that he and God were to shape the destinies of earth.  When Marshal Foch, the foremost strategist in the world, representing the governments of the Allies and the United States, delivered to the emissaries of Germany terms upon which they might surrender, he brought to an end the bloodiest, the most destructive and the most beneficent war the world has known. It is worthy of note in this connection that the three great wars in which the United States of America engaged have been wars for freedom. The Revolutionary War was for the liberty of the colonies; the Civil War was waged for the freedom of manhood and for the principle of the indissolubility of the Union; the World War, beginning 1914, was fought for the right of small nations to self-government and for the right of every country to the free use of the high seas.  More than four million American men were under arms when the conflict ended. Of these, more than two million were upon the fields of France and Italy. These were thoroughly trained in the military art. They had proved their right to be considered among the most formidable soldiers the world has known. Against the brown rock of that host in khaki, the flower of German savagery and courage had broken at Chateau-Thierry. There the high tide of Prussian militarism, after what had seemed to be an irresistible dash for the destruction of France, spent itself in the bloody froth and spume of bitter defeat. There the Prussian Guard encountered the Marines, the Iron Division and the other heroic organizations of America\\'s new army. There German soldiers who had been hardened and trained under German conscription before the war, and who had learned new arts in their bloody trade, through their service in the World War, met their masters in young Americans taken from the shop, the field, and the forge, youths who had been sent into battle with a scant six months\\' intensive training in the art of war. Not only did these American soldiers hold the German onslaught where it was but, in a sudden, fierce, resistless counter-thrust they drove back in defeat and confusion the Prussian Guard, the Pommeranian Reserves, and smashed the morale of that German division beyond hope of resurrection.  The news of that exploit sped from the Alps to the North Sea Coast, through all the camps of the Allies, with incredible rapidity. \"The Americans have held the Germans. They can fight,\" ran the message. New life came into the war-weary ranks of heroic poilus and into the steel-hard armies of Great Britain. \"The Americans are as good as the best. There are millions of them, and millions more are coming,\" was heard on every side. The transfusion of American blood came as magic tonic, and from that glorious day there was never a doubt as to the speedy defeat of Germany. From that day the German retreat dated. The armistice signed on November 11, 1918, was merely the period finishing the death sentence of German militarism, the first word of which was uttered at Chateau-Thierry.  Germany\\'s defiance to the world, her determination to force her will and her \"kultur\" upon the democracies of earth, produced the conflict. She called to her aid three sister autocracies: Turkey, a land ruled by the whims of a long line of moody misanthropic monarchs; Bulgaria, the traitor nation cast by its Teutonic king into a war in which its people had no choice and little sympathy; Austria-Hungary, a congeries of races in which a Teutonic minority ruled with an iron scepter.  Against this phalanx of autocracy, twenty-four nations arrayed themselves. Populations of these twenty-eight warring nations far exceeded the total population of all the remainder of humanity. The conflagration of war literally belted the earth. It consumed the most civilized of capitals. It raged in the swamps and forests of Africa. To its call came alien peoples speaking words that none but themselves could translate, wearing garments of exotic cut and hue amid the smart garbs and sober hues of modern civilization. A twentieth century Babel came to the fields of France for freedom\\'s sake, and there was born an internationalism making for the future understanding and peace of the world.

Never before in the history of the world were so many races and peoples mingled in a military effort as those that came together under the command of Marshal Foch. If we divide the human races into white, yellow, red and black, all four were largely represented. Among the white races there were Frenchmen, Italians, Portuguese, English, Scottish, Welsh, Irish, Canadians, Australians, South Africans (of both British and Dutch descent) New Zealanders; in the American army, probably every other European nation was represented, with additional contingents from those already named, so that every branch of the white race figured in the ethnological total.  There were representatives of many Asiatic races, including not only the volunteers from the native states of India, but elements from the French colony in Cochin China, with Annam, Cambodia, Tonkin, Laos, and Kwang Chau Wan. England and France both contributed many African tribes, including Arabs from Algeria and Tunis, Senegalese, Saharans, and many of the South African races. The red races of North America were represented in the armies of both Canada and the United States, while the Maoris, Samoans, and other Polynesian races were likewise represented. And as, in the American Army, there were men of German, Austrian, and Hungarian descent, and, in all probability, contingents also of Bulgarian and Turkish blood, it may be said that Foch commanded an army representing the whole human race, united in defense of the ideals of the Allies.  It will be seen that more than ten times the number of neutral persons were engulfed in the maelstrom of war. Millions of these suffered from it during the entire period of the conflict, four years three months and fifteen days, a total of 1,567 days. For almost four years Germany rolled up a record of victories on land and of piracies on and under the seas.  [Illustration: TERRITORY OCCUPIED BY THE ALLIES UNDER THE ARMISTICE OF NOVEMBER 11, 1918 (East/West: Brussels to Berlin; North South: Keil to Bern)]   Dotted area, invaded territory of Belgium, France, Luxembourg and   Alsace-Lorraine to be evacuated in fourteen days; area in small   squares, part of Germany west of the Rhine to be evacuated in   twenty-five days and occupied by Allied and U. S. troops; lightly   shaded area to east of Rhine, neutral zone; black semi-circles   bridge-heads of thirty kilometers radius in the neutral zone to be   occupied by Allied armies.   Little by little, day after day, piracies dwindled as the murderous submarine was mastered and its menace strangled. On the land, the Allies, under the matchless leadership of Marshal Ferdinand Foch and the generous co-operation of Americans, British, French and Italians, under the great Generals Pershing, Haig, Petain and Diaz, wrested the initiative from von Hindenburg and Ludendorf, late in July, 1918. Then, in one hundred and fifteen days of wonderful strategy and the fiercest fighting the world has ever witnessed, Foch and the Allies closed upon the Germanic armies the jaws of a steel trap. A series of brilliant maneuvers dating from the battle of Chateau-Thierry in which the Americans checked the Teutonic rush, resulted in the defeat and rout on all the fronts of the Teutonic commands.  In that titanic effort, America\\'s share was that of the final deciding factor. A nation unjustly titled the \"Dollar Nation,\" believed by Germany and by other countries to be soft, selfish and wasteful, became over night hard as tempered steel, self-sacrificing with an altruism that inspired the world and thrifty beyond all precedent in order that not only its own armies but the armies of the Allies might be fed and munitioned.  Leading American thought and American action, President Wilson stood out as the prophet of the democracies of the world. Not only did he inspire America and the Allies to a military and naval effort beyond precedent, but he inspired the civilian populations of the world to extraordinary effort, efforts that eventually won the war. For the decision was gained quite as certainly on the wheat fields of Western America, in the shops and the mines and the homes of America as it was upon the battle-field.  This effort came in response to the following appeal by the President:   These, then, are the things we must do, and do well, besides fighting--the things without which mere fighting would be fruitless:  We must supply abundant food for ourselves and for our armies and our seamen not only, but also for a large part of the nations with whom we have now made common cause, in whose support and by whose sides we shall be fighting;  We must supply ships by the hundreds out of our shipyards to carry to the other side of the sea, submarines or no submarines, what will every day be needed there; and--  Abundant materials out of our fields and our mines and our factories with which not only to clothe and equip our own forces on land and sea but also to clothe and support our people for whom the gallant fellows under arms can no longer work, to help clothe and equip the armies with which we are co-operating in Europe, and to keep the looms and manufactories there in raw material;  Coal to keep the fires going in ships at sea and in the furnaces of hundreds of factories across the sea;  Steel out of which to make arms and ammunition both here and there;  Rails for worn-out railways back of the fighting fronts;  Locomotives and rolling stock to take the place of those every day going to pieces;  Everything with which the people of England and France and Italy and Russia have usually supplied themselves, but cannot now afford the men, the materials, or the machinery to make.  I particularly appeal to the farmers of the South to plant abundant foodstuffs as well as cotton. They can show their patriotism in no better or more convincing way than by resisting the great temptation of the present price of cotton and helping, helping upon a large scale, to feed the nation and the peoples everywhere who are fighting for their liberties and for our own. The variety of their crops will be the visible measure of their comprehension of their national duty.   The response was amazing in its enthusiastic and general compliance. No autocracy issuing a ukase could have been obeyed so explicitly. Not only did the various classes of workers and individuals observe the President\\'s suggestions to the letter, but they yielded up individual right after right in order that the war work of the government might be expedited. Extraordinary powers and functions were granted by the people through Congress, and it was not until peace was declared that these rights and powers returned to the people.  These governmental activities ceased functioning after the war: Food administration; Fuel administration; Espionage act; War trade board; Alien property custodian (with extension of time for certain duties); Agricultural stimulation; Housing construction (except for shipbuilders); Control of telegraphs and telephones; Export control.  These functions were extended: Control over railroads: to cease within twenty-one months after the proclamation of peace.  The War Finance Corporation: to cease to function six months after the war, with further time for liquidation.  The Capital Issues Committee: to terminate in six months after the peace proclamation.  The Aircraft Board: to end in six months after peace was proclaimed; and the government operation of ships, within five years after the war was officially ended.   President Wilson, generally acclaimed as the leader of the world\\'s democracies, phrased for civilization the arguments against autocracy in the great peace conference after the war. The President headed the American delegation to that conclave of world re-construction. With him as delegates to the conference were Robert Lansing, Secretary of State; Henry White, former Ambassador to France and Italy; Edward M. House and General Tasker H. Bliss.  Representing American Labor at the International Labor conference held in Paris simultaneously with the Peace Conference were Samuel Gompers, president of the American Federation of Labor; William Green, secretary-treasurer of the United Mine Workers of America; John R. Alpine, president of the Plumbers\\' Union; James Duncan, president of the International Association of Granite Cutters; Frank Duffy, president of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, and Frank Morrison, secretary of the American Federation of Labor.  Estimating the share of each Allied nation in the great victory, mankind will conclude that the heaviest cost in proportion to prewar population and treasure was paid by the nations that first felt the shock of war, Belgium, Serbia, Poland and France. All four were the battle-grounds of huge armies, oscillating in a bloody frenzy over once fertile fields and once prosperous towns.  Belgium, with a population of 8,000,000, had a casualty list of more than 350,000; France, with its casualties of 4,000,000 out of a population (including its colonies) of 90,000,000, is really the martyr nation of the world. Her gallant poilus showed the world how cheerfully men may die in defense of home and liberty. Huge Russia, including hapless Poland, had a casualty list of 7,000,000 out of its entire population of 180,000,000. The United States out of a population of 110,000,000 had a casualty list of 236,117 for nineteen months of war; of these 53,169 were killed or died of disease; 179,625 were wounded; and 3,323 prisoners or missing.

[Illustration: KING GEORGE V]   King of Great Britain and Ireland and Emperor of India, who struggled   earnestly to prevent the war, but when Germany attacked Belgium sent   the mighty forces of the British Empire to stop the Hun.   To the glory of Great Britain must be recorded the enormous effort made by its people, showing through operations of its army and navy. The British Empire, including, the Colonies, had a casualty list of 3,049,992 men out of a total population of 440,000,000. Of these 658,665 were killed; 2,032,122 were wounded, and 359,204 were reported missing. It raised an army of 7,000,000, and fought seven separate foreign campaigns, in France, Italy, Dardanelles, Mesopotamia, Macedonia, East Africa and Egypt. It raised its navy personnel from 115,000 to 450,000 men. Co-operating with its allies on the sea, it destroyed approximately one hundred and fifty German and Austrian submarines. It aided materially the American navy and transport service in sending overseas the great American army whose coming decided the war. The British navy and transport service during the war made the following record of transportation and convoy:  Twenty million men, 2,000,000 horses, 130,000,000 tons of food, 25,000,000 tons of explosives and supplies, 51,000,000 tons of oil and fuels, 500,000 vehicles. In 1917 alone 7,000,000 men, 500,000 animals, 200,000 vehicles and 9,500,000 tons of stores were conveyed to the several war fronts.  The German losses were estimated at 1,588,000 killed or died of disease; 4,000,000 wounded; and 750,000 prisoners and missing.  A tabulation of the estimates of casualties and the money cost of the war reveals the enormous price paid by humanity to convince a military-mad Germanic caste that Right and not Might must hereafter rule the world. These figures do not include Serbian losses, which are unavailable.

Was the cost too heavy? Was the price of international liberty paid in human lives and in sacrifices untold too great for the peace that followed?  Even the most practical of money changers, the most sentimental pacifist, viewing the cost in connection with the liberation of whole nations, with the spread of enlightened liberty through oppressed and benighted lands, with the destruction of autocracy, of the military caste, and of Teutonic kultur in its materialistic aspect, must agree that the blood was well shed, the treasure well spent.  Millions of gallant, eager youths learned how to die fearlessly and gloriously. They died to teach vandal nations that nevermore will humanity permit the exploitation of peoples for militaristic purposes.  As Milton, the great philosopher poet, phrased the lesson taught to Germany on the fields of France:  They err who count it glorious to subdue By conquest far and wide, to overrun Large countries, and in field great battles win, Great cities by assault; what do these worthies But rob and spoil, burn, slaughter, and enslave Peaceable nations, neighboring or remote Made captive, yet deserving freedom more Than those their conquerors, who leave behind Nothing but ruin wheresoe\\'er they rove And all the flourishing works of peace destroy.    CHAPTER II  THE WORLD SUDDENLY TURNED UPSIDE DOWN  Demoralization, like the black plague of the middle ages, spread in every direction immediately following the first overt acts of war. Men who were millionaires at nightfall awoke the next morning to find themselves bankrupt through depreciation of their stock-holdings. Prosperous firms of importers were put out of business. International commerce was dislocated to an extent unprecedented in history.  The greatest of hardships immediately following the war, however, were visited upon those who unhappily were caught on their vacations or on their business trips within the area affected by the war. Not only men, but women and children, were subjected to privations of the severest character. Notes which had been negotiable, paper money of every description, and even silver currency suddenly became of little value. Americans living in hotels and pensions facing this sudden shrinkage in their money, were compelled to leave the roofs that had sheltered them. That which was true of Americans was true of all other nationalities, so that every embassy and the office of every consul became a miniature Babel of excited, distressed humanity.  The sudden seizure of railroads for war purposes in Germany, France, Austria and Russia, cut off thousands of travelers in villages that were almost inaccessible. Europeans being comparatively close to their homes, were not in straits as severe as the Americans whose only hope for aid lay in the speedy arrival of American gold. Prices of food soared beyond all precedent and many of these hapless strangers went under. Paris, the brightest and gayest city in Europe, suddenly became the most somber of dwelling places. No traffic was permitted on the highways at night. No lights were permitted and all the cafes were closed at eight o\\'clock. The gay capital was placed under iron military rule.  Seaports, and especially the pleasure resorts in France, Belgium and England, were placed under a military supervision. Visitors were ordered to return to their homes and every resort was shrouded with darkness at night. The records of those early days are filled with stories of dramatic happenings.  On the night of July 31st Jean Leon Jaures, the famous leader of French Socialists, was assassinated while dining in a small restaurant near the Paris Bourse. His assassin was Raoul Villein. Jaures had been endeavoring to accomplish a union of French and German Socialists with the aim of preventing the war. The object of the assassination appeared to have been wholly political.  On the same day stock exchanges throughout the United States were closed, following the example of European stock exchanges. Ship insurance soared to prohibitive figures. Reservists of the French and German armies living outside of their native land were called to the colors and their homeward rush still further complicated transportation for civilians. All the countries of Europe clamored for gold. North and South America complied with the demand by sending cargoes of the precious metal overseas. The German ship Kron Prinzessin with a cargo of gold, attempted to make the voyage to Hamburg, but a wireless warning that Allied cruisers were waiting for it off the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, compelled the big ship to turn back to safety in America.  Channel boats bearing American refugees from the Continent to London were described as floating hells. London was excited over the war and holiday spirit, and overrun with five thousand citizens of the United States tearfully pleading with the American Ambassador for money for transportation home or assurances of personal safety.  The condition of the terror-stricken tourists fleeing to the friendly shores of England from Continental countries crowded with soldiers dragging in their wake heavy guns, resulted in an extraordinary gathering of two thousand Americans at a hotel one afternoon and the formation of a preliminary organization to afford relief. Some people who attended the meeting were already beginning to feel the pinch of want with little prospects of immediate succor. One man and wife, with four children, had six cents when he appealed to Ambassador Page after an exciting escape from German territory.   [Illustration: WHERE THE WORLD WAR BEGAN. Map showing 15 degrees East to 28 degrees East; 35 degrees North to 52 degrees North. Germany and Russia on the North; the Mediterranean on the South; the Adriatic Sea on the West; the Aegean and Western Turkey on the East.]   Oscar Straus, worth ten millions, struck London with nine dollars. Although he had letters of credit for five thousand, he was unable to cash them in Vienna. Women hugging newspaper bundles containing expensive Paris frocks and millinery were herded in third-class carriages and compelled to stand many hours. They reached London utterly fatigued and unkempt, but mainly cheerful, only to find the hotels choked with fellow countrymen fortunate to reach there sooner.  The Ambassador was harassed by anxious women and children who asked many absurd questions which he could not answer. He said:  \"The appeals of these people are most distressing. They are very much excited, and no small wonder. I regret I have no definite news of the prospects or plans of the government for relief. I have communicated their condition to the Department of State and expect a response and assurances of coming aid as soon as possible. That the government will act I have not the slightest doubt. I am confident that Washington will do everything in her power for relief. How soon, I cannot tell. I have heard many distressing tales during the last forty-eight hours.\"  A crowd filled the Ambassador\\'s office on the first floor of the flat building, in Victoria Street, which was mainly composed of women, school teachers, art students, and other persons doing Europe on a shoestring. Many were entirely out of money and with limited securities, which were not negotiable.  The action of the British Government extending the bank holiday till Thursday of that week was discouraging news for the new arrivals from the Continent, as it was uncertain whether the express and steamship companies would open in the morning for the cashing of checks and the delivery of mail, as was announced the previous Saturday.  Doctors J. Riddle Goffe, of New York; Frank F. Simpson, of Pittsburgh; Arthur D. Ballon of Vistaburg, Mich., and B. F. Martin, of Chicago, formed themselves into a committee, and asked the co-operation of the press in America to bring about adequate assistance for the marooned Americans, and to urge the bankers of the United States to insist on their letters of credit and travelers\\' checks being honored so far as possible by the agents in Europe upon whom they were drawn.   [Illustration: THE CATHEDRAL OF RHEIMS]   In the first weeks of the war the Germans occupied Rheims, but were   driven out after von Kluck\\'s retreat. On September 20, 1914, they were   reported as first shelling the Cathedral of Rheims and the civilized   world stood aghast, for the edifice, begun in 1212, is one of the   chief glories of Gothic architecture in all Europe.   [Illustration: Seven men marching abreast.]   Photo by Underwood and Underwood. N.Y.   THE KAISER AND HIS SIX SONS   The ex-Emperor and his sons leading a procession in Berlin soon after   the declaration of war. It was noted that in spite of their martial   appearance the royal family were extremely careful to keep out of   range of the Allied guns. From left to right they are: The Kaiser,   Crown Prince Wilhelm, Princes Eitel Friedrich, Adalbert, August, Oscar   and Joachim.   Dr. Martin and Dr. Simpson, who left London on Saturday for Switzerland to fetch back a young American girl, were unable to get beyond Paris, and they returned to London. Everywhere they found trains packed with refugees whose only object in life apparently was to reach the channel boats, accepting cheerfully the discomforts of those vessels if only able to get out of the war.  Rev. J. P. Garfield, of Claremore, N. H., gave the following account of his experiences in Holland:  \"On sailing from the Hook of Holland near midnight we pulled out just as the boat train from The Hague arrived. The steamer paused, but as she was filled to her capacity she later continued on her voyage, leaving fully two hundred persons marooned on the wharf.  \"Our discomforts while crossing the North Sea were great. Every seat was filled with sleepers, the cabins were given to women and children. The crowd, as a rule, was helpful and kindly, the single men carrying the babies and people lending money to those without funds. Despite the refugee conditions prevailing it was noticeable that many women on the Hook wharf clung tenaciously to bandboxes containing Parisian hats.\"  Travelers from Cologne said that searchlights were operated from the tops of the hotels all night searching for airplanes, and machine guns were mounted on the famous Cologne Cathedral. They also reported that tourists were refused hotel accommodations at Frankfort because they were without cash.  Men, women and children sat in the streets all night. The trains were stopped several miles from the German frontier and the passengers, especially the women and children, suffered great hardship being forced to continue their journey on foot.  Passengers arriving at London from Montreal on the Cunard Line steamer Andania, bound for Southampton, reported the vessel was met at sea by a British torpedo boat and ordered by wireless to stop. The liner then was led into Plymouth as a matter of precaution against mines. Plymouth was filled with soldiers and searchlights were seen constantly flashing about the harbor.  Otis B. Kent, an attorney for the Interstate Commerce Commission, of Washington, arrived in London after an exciting journey from Petrograd. Unable to find accommodations at a hotel he slept on the railway station floor. He said:  \"I had been on a trip to Sweden to see the midnight sun. I did not realize the gravity of the situation until I saw the Russian fleet cleared for action. This was only July 26th, at Kronstadt, where the shipyards were working overtime.  \"I arrived at the Russian capital on the following day. Enormous demonstrations were taking place. I was warned to get out and left on the night of the 28th for Berlin. I saw Russian soldiers drilling at the stations and artillery constantly on the move.  \"At Berlin I was warned to keep off the streets for fear of being mistaken for an Englishmen. At Hamburg the number of warnings was increased. Two Russians who refused to rise in a cafe when the German anthem was played were attacked and badly beaten. I also saw two Englishmen attacked in the street, but they finally were rescued by the police.  \"There was a harrowing scene when the Hamburg-American Line steamer Imperator canceled its sailing. She left stranded three thousand passengers, most of them short of money, and the women wailing. About one hundred and fifty of us were given passage in the second class of the American Line steamship Philadelphia, for which I was offered $400 by a speculator.  \"The journey to Flushing was made in a packed train, its occupants lacking sleep and food. No trouble was encountered on the frontier.\"  Theodore Hetzler, of the Fifth Avenue Bank, was appointed chairman of the meeting for preliminary relief of the stranded tourists, and committees were named to interview officials of the steamship companies and of the hotels, to search for lost baggage, to make arrangements for the honoring of all proper checks and notes, and to confer with the members of the American embassy.  Oscar Straus, who arrived from Paris, said that the United States embassy there was working hard to get Americans out of France. Great enthusiasm prevailed at the French capital, he said, owing to the announcement that the United States Government was considering a plan to send transports to take Americans home.  The following committees were appointed at the meeting:  Finance--Theodore Hetzler, Fred I. Kent and James G. Cannon; Transportation--Joseph F. Day, Francis M. Weld and George D. Smith, all of New York; Diplomatic--Oscar S. Straus, Walter L. Fisher and James Byrne; Hotels--L. H. Armour, of Chicago, and Thomas J. Shanley, New York.  The committee established headquarters where Americans might register and obtain assistance. Chandler Anderson, a member of the International Claims Commission, arrived in London from Paris. He said he had been engaged with the work of the commission at Versailles, when he was warned by the American embassy that he had better leave France. He acted promptly on this advice and the commission was adjourned until after the war. Mr. Anderson had to leave his baggage behind him because the railway company would not register it. He said the city of Paris presented a strange contrast to the ordinary animation prevailing there. Most of the shops were closed. There were no taxis in the streets, and only a few vehicles drawn by horses.  The armored cruiser Tennessee, converted for the time being into a treasure ship, left New York on the night of August 6th, 1914, to carry $7,500,000 in gold to the many thousand Americans who were in want in European countries. Included in the $7,500,000 was $2,500,000 appropriated by the government. Private consignments in gold in sums from $1,000 to $5,000 were accepted by Colonel Smith, of the army quartermaster\\'s department, who undertook their delivery to Americans in Paris and other European ports.  The cruiser carried as passengers Ambassador Willard, who returned to his post at Madrid, and army and naval officers assigned as military observers in Europe. On the return trip accommodations for 200 Americans were available.  The dreadnaught Florida, after being hastily coaled and provisioned, left the Brooklyn Navy Yard under sealed orders at 9.30 o\\'clock the morning of August 6th and proceeded to Tompkinsville, where she dropped anchor near the Tennessee.  The Florida was sent to protect the neutrality of American ports and prohibit supplies to belligerent ships. Secretary Daniels ordered her to watch the port of New York and sent the Mayflower to Hampton Roads. Destroyers guarded ports along the New England coast and those at Lewes, Del., to prevent violations of neutrality at Philadelphia and in that territory. Any vessel that attempted to sail for a belligerent port without clearance papers was boarded by American officials.  The Texas and Louisiana, at Vera Cruz and the Minnesota, at Tampico, were ordered to New York, and Secretary Daniels announced that other American vessels would be ordered north as fast as room could be found for them in navy yard docks.  At wireless stations, under the censorship ordered by the President, no code messages were allowed in any circumstances. Messages which might help any of the belligerents in any way were barred.  The torpedo-boat destroyer Warrington and the revenue cutter Androscoggin arrived at Bar Harbor on August 6th, to enforce neutrality regulations and allowed no foreign ships to leave Frenchman\\'s Bay without clearance papers. The United States cruiser Milwaukee sailed the same day from the Puget Sound Navy Yard to form part of the coast patrol to enforce neutrality regulations.  Arrangements were made in Paris by Myron T. Herrick, the American Ambassador, acting under instructions from Washington, to take over the affairs of the German embassy, while Alexander H. Thackara, the American Consul General, looked after the affairs of the German consulate.  President Poincare and the members of the French cabinet later issued a joint proclamation to the French nation in which was the phrase \"mobilization is not war.\"  The marching of the soldiers in the streets with the English, Russian and French flags flying, the singing of patriotic songs and the shouting of \"On to Berlin!\" were much less remarkable than the general demeanor and cold resolution of most of the people.  The response to the order of mobilization was instant, and the stations of all the railways, particularly those leading to the eastward, were crowded with reservists. Many women accompanied the men until close to the stations, where, softly crying, farewells were said. The troop trains left at frequent intervals. All the automobile busses disappeared, having been requisitioned by the army to carry meat, the coachwork of the vehicles being removed and replaced with specially designed bodies. A large number of taxicabs, private automobiles and horses and carts also were taken over by the military for transport purposes.  The wildest enthusiasm was manifested on the boulevards when the news of the ordering of the mobilization became known. Bodies of men formed into regular companies in ranks ten deep, paraded the streets waving the tricolor and other national emblems and cheering and singing the \"Marseillaise\" and the \"Internationale,\" at the same time throwing their hats in the air. On the sidewalks were many weeping women and children. All the stores and cafes were deserted.  All foreigners were compelled to leave Paris or France before the end of the first day of mobilization by train but not by automobile. Time tables were posted on the walls of Paris giving the times of certain trains on which these people might leave the city.  American citizens or British subjects were allowed to remain in France, except in the regions on the eastern frontier and near certain fortresses, provided they made declaration to the police and obtained a special permit.  As to Italy\\'s situation, Rome was quite calm and the normal aspect made tourists decide that Italy was the safest place. Austria\\'s note to Serbia was issued without consulting Italy. One point of the Triple Alliance provided that no member should take action in the Balkans before an agreement with the other allies. Such an agreement did not take place. The alliance was of defensive, not aggressive, character and could not force an ally to follow any enterprise taken on the sole account and without a notice, as such action taken by Austria against Serbia. It was felt even then that Italy would eventually cast its lot with the Entente Allies.  Secretary of the Treasury William G. McAdoo; John Skelton Williams, Comptroller of the Currency; Charles S. Hamblin and William P. G. Harding, members of the Federal Reserve Board, went to New York early in August, 1914, where they discussed relief measures with a group of leading bankers at what was regarded as the most momentous conference of the kind held in the country in recent years.  The New York Clearing House Committee, on August 2d, called a meeting of the Clearing House Association, to arrange for the immediate issuance of clearing house certificates. Among those at the conference were J. P. Morgan and his partner, Henry P. Davison; Frank A. Vanderlip, president of the National City Bank, and A. Barton Hepburn, chairman of the Chase National Bank.    CHAPTER III  WHY THE WORLD WENT TO WAR  While it is true that the war was conceived in Berlin, it is none the less true that it was born in the Balkans. It is necessary in order that we may view with correct perspective the background of the World War, that we gain some notion of the Balkan States and the complications entering into their relations. These countries have been the adopted children of the great European powers during generations of rulers. Russia assumed guardianship of the nations having a preponderance of Slavic blood; Roumania with its Latin consanguinities was close to France and Italy; Bulgaria, Greece, and Balkan Turkey were debatable regions wherein the diplomats of the rival nations secured temporary victories by devious methods.  The Balkans have fierce hatreds and have been the site of sudden historic wars. At the time of the declaration of the World War, the Balkan nations were living under the provisions of the Treaty of Bucharest, dated August 10, 1913. Greece, Roumania, Bulgaria, Serbia and Montenegro were signers, and Turkey acquiesced in its provisions.   [Illustration: PROVISIONS OF THE TREATY OF BUCHAREST, 1913. (Map showing the Adriatic on the West, the Black Sea on the East, Roumania on the North and Crete on the South. Cross hatching show land allocations among Serbia, Montenegro, Greece, Bulgaria and Roumania.)]   The assassination at Sarajevo had sent a convulsive shudder throughout the Balkans. The reason lay in the century-old antagonism between the Slav and the Teuton. Serbia, Montenegro and Russia had never forgiven Austria for seizing Bosnia and Herzegovina and making these Slavic people subjects of the Austrian crown. Bulgaria, Roumania and Turkey remained cold at the news of the assassination. German diplomacy was in the ascendant at these courts and the prospect of war with Germany as their great ally presented no terrors for them. The sympathies of the people of Greece were with Serbia, but the Grecian Court, because the Queen of Greece was the only sister of the German Kaiser, was whole heartedly with Austria. Perhaps at the first the Roumanians were most nearly neutral. They believed strongly that each of the small nations of the Balkan region as well as all of the small nations that had been absorbed but had not been digested by Austria, should cut itself from the leading strings held by the large European powers. There was a distinct undercurrent, for a federation resembling that of the United States of America between these peoples. This was expressed most clearly by M. Jonesco, leader of the Liberal party of Roumania and generally recognized as the ablest statesman of middle Europe. He declared:  \"I always believed, and still believe, that the Balkan States cannot secure their future otherwise than by a close understanding among themselves, whether this understanding shall or shall not take the form of a federation. No one of the Balkan States is strong enough to resist the pressure from one or another of the European powers.  \"For this reason I am deeply grieved to see in the Balkan coalition of 1912 Roumania not invited. If Roumania had taken part in the first one, we should not have had the second. I did all that was in my power and succeeded in preventing the war between Roumania and the Balkan League in the winter of 1912-13.  \"I risked my popularity, and I do not feel sorry for it. I employed all my efforts to prevent the second Balkan war, which, as is well known, was profitable to us. I repeatedly told the Bulgarians that they ought not to enter it because in that case we would enter it too. But I was not successful in my efforts.  \"During the second Balkan war I did all in my power to end it as quickly as possible. At the conference at Bucharest I made efforts, as Mr. Pashich and Mr. Venizelos know very well, to secure for beaten Bulgaria the best terms. My object was to obtain a new coalition of all the Balkan States, including Roumania. Had I succeeded in this the situation would be much better. No reasonable man will deny that the Balkan States are neutralizing each other at the present time, which in itself makes the whole situation all the more miserable.  \"In October, 1913, when I succeeded in facilitating the conclusion of peace between Greece and Turkey, I was pursuing the same object of the Balkan coalition. On my return from Athens I endeavored, though without success, to put the Greco-Turkish relations on a basis of friendship, being convinced that the well-understood interest of both countries lies not only in friendly relations, but even in an alliance between them.  \"The dissensions that exist between the Balkan States can be settled in a friendly way without war. The best moment for this would be after the general war, when the map of Europe will be remade. The Balkan country which would start war against another Balkan country would commit, not only a crime against her own future, but an act of folly as well.  \"The destiny and future of the Balkan States, and of all the small European peoples as well, will not be regulated by fratricidal wars, but, with this great European struggle, the real object of which is to settle the question whether Europe shall enter an era of justice, and therefore happiness for the small peoples, or whether we will face a period of oppression more or less gilt-edged. And as I always believed that wisdom and truth will triumph in the end, I want to believe, too, that, in spite of the pessimistic news reaching me from the different sides of the Balkan countries, there will be no war among them in order to justify those who do not believe in the vitality of the small peoples.\"  The conference at Rome, April 10, 1918, to settle outstanding questions between the Italians and the Slavs of the Adriatic, drew attention to those Slavonic peoples in Europe who were under non-Slavonic rule. At the beginning of the war there were three great Slavonic groups in Europe: First, the Russians with the Little Russians, speaking languages not more different than the dialect of Yorkshire is from the dialect of Devonshire; second, a central group, including the Poles, the Czechs or Bohemians, the Moravians, and Slovaks, this group thus being separated under the four crowns of Russia, Germany, Austria and Hungary; the third, the southern group, included the Sclavonians, the Croatians, the Dalmatians, Bosnians, Herzegovinians, the Slavs, generally called Slovenes, in the western part of Austria, down to Goritzia, and also the two independent kingdoms of Montenegro and Serbia.  Like the central group, this southern group of Slavs was divided under four crowns, Hungary, Austria, Montenegro, and Serbia; but, in spite of the fact that half belong to the Western and half to the Eastern Church, they are all essentially the same people, though with considerable infusion of non-Slavonic blood, there being a good deal of Turkish blood in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The languages, however, are practically identical, formed largely of pure Slavonic materials, and, curiously, much more closely connected with the eastern Slav group--Russia and Little Russia--than with the central group, Polish and Bohemian. A Russian of Moscow will find it much easier to understand a Slovene from Goritzia than a Pole from Warsaw. The Ruthenians in southern Galicia and Bukowina, are identical in race and speech with the Little Russians of Ukrainia.  Of the central group, the Poles have generally inclined to Austria, which has always supported the Polish landlords of Galicia against the Ruthenian peasantry; while the Czechs have been not so much anti-Austrian as anti-German. Indeed, the Hapsburg rulers have again and again played these Slavs off against their German subjects. It was the Southern Slav question as affecting Serbia and Austria, that gave the pretext for the present war. The central Slav question affecting the destiny of the Poles--was a bone of contention between Austria and Germany. It is the custom to call the Southern Slavs \"Jugoslavs\" from the Slav word Yugo, \"south,\" but as this is a concession to German transliteration, many prefer to write the word \"Yugoslav,\" which represents its pronunciation. The South Slav question was created by the incursions of three Asiatic peoples--Huns, Magyars, Turks--who broke up the originally continuous Slav territory that ran from the White Sea to the confines of Greece and the Adriatic.

SERBS DEFENDING THE MOUNTAIN PASSES LEADING TO THEIR CAPITAL   Little Serbia, before she was overwhelmed by the concentrated force of   a mighty Teuton drive, and afterward, did some fighting that   astonished the world. The photo shows some of her artillery engaged in   holding back the enemy in the mountain regions near Nish.   [Illustration: A SCENE FROM EARLY TRENCH WARFARE. Painting shows German soldiers defending a trench line on the left. British attackers are approaching from the right. Several men are already dead in front of the trench.]   From the woods in the background the British charge on an angle of the   German breastworks under cover of artillery and machine-gun fire. This   illustrates the early trench warfare before the development of the   elaborate concrete-protected structures the Germans later devised.   They can be seen wearing the famous spiked helmets which were later   replaced by steel ones.   This was the complex of nationalities, the ferment of races existing in 1914. Out of the hatreds engendered by the domination over the liberty-loving Slavic peoples by an arrogant Teutonic minority grew the assassinations at Sarajevo. These crimes were the expression of hatred not for the heir apparent of Austria but for the Hapsburg and their Germanic associates.  By a twist of the wheel of fate, the same Slavic peoples whose determination to rid themselves of the Teutonic yoke, started the war, also bore rather more than their share in the swift-moving events that decided and closed the war.  Russia, the dying giant among the great nations, championed the Slavic peoples at the beginning of the war. It entered the conflict in aid of little Serbia, but at the end Russia bowed to Germany in the infamous peace treaty at Brest-Litovsk. Thereafter during the last months of the war Russia was virtually an ally of its ancient enemy, Turkey, the \"Sick Man of Europe,\" and the central German empires. With these allies the Bolshevik government of Russia attempted to head off the Czecho-Slovak regiments that had been captured by Russia during its drive into Austria and had been imprisoned in Siberia. After the peace consummated at Brest-Litovsk, these regiments determined to fight on the side of the Allies and endeavored to make their way to the western front.  No war problems were more difficult than those of the Czecho-Slovaks. Few have been handled so masterfully. Surrounded by powerful enemies which for centuries have been bent on destroying every trace of Slavic culture, they had learned how to defend themselves against every trick or scheme of the brutal Germans.  The Czecho-Slovak plan in Russia was of great value to the Allies all over the world, and was put at their service by Professor Thomas G. Masaryk. He went to Russia when everything was adrift and got hold of Bohemian prisoners here and there and organized them into a compact little army of 50,000 to 60,000 men. Equipped and fed, he moved them to whatever point had most power to thoroughly disrupt the German plans. They did much to check the German army for months. They resolutely refused to take any part in Russian political affairs, and when it seemed no longer possible to work effectively in Russia this remarkable little band started on a journey all round the world to get to the western front. They loyally gave up most of their arms under agreement with Lenine and Trotzky that they might peacefully proceed out of Russia via Vladivostok.  While they were carrying out their part of the agreement, and well on the way, they were surprised by telegrams from Lenine and Trotzky to the Soviets in Siberia ordering them to take away their arms and intern them.  The story of what occurred then was told by two American engineers, Emerson and Hawkins, who, on the way to Ambassador Francis, and not being able to reach Vologda, joined a band of four or five thousand. The engineers were with them three months, while they were making it safe along the lines of the railroad for the rest of the Czecho-Slovaks to get out, and incidentally for Siberians to resume peaceful occupations. They were also supported by old railway organizations which had stuck bravely to them without wages and which every little while were \"shot up\" by the Bolsheviki.  Distress in Russia would have been much more intense had it not been for the loyalty of the railway men in sticking to their tasks. Some American engineers at Irkutsk, on a peaceful journey out of Russia, on descending from the cars were met with a demand to surrender, and shots from machine guns. Some, fortunately, had kept hand grenades, and with these and a few rifles went straight at the machine guns. Although outnumbered, the attackers took the guns and soon afterward took the town. The Czecho-Slovaks, in the beginning almost unarmed, went against great odds and won for themselves the right to be considered a nation.  Seeing the treachery of Lenine and Trotzky, they went back toward the west and made things secure for their men left behind. They took town after town with the arms they first took away from the Bolsheviki and Germans; but in every town they immediately set up a government, with all the elements of normal life. They established police and sanitary systems, opened hospitals, and had roads repaired, leaving a handful of men in the midst of enemies to carry on the plans of their leaders. American engineers speaking of the cleanliness of the Czecho-Slovak army, said that they lived like Spartans.  The whole story is a remarkable evidence of the struggle of these little people for self-government.  The emergence of the Czecho-Slovak nation has been one of the most remarkable and noteworthy features of the war. Out of the confusion of the situation, with the possibility of the resurrection of oppressed peoples, something of the dignity of old Bohemia was comprehended, and it was recognized that the Czechs were to be rescued from Austria and the Slovaks from Hungary, and united in one country with entire independence. This was undoubtedly due, in large measure, to the activities of Professor Masaryk, the president of the National Executive Council of the Czecho-Slovaks. His four-year exile in the United States had the establishment of the new nation as its fruit.  Professor Masaryk called attention to the fact that there is a peculiar discrepancy between the number of states in Europe and the number of nationalities--twenty-seven states to seventy nationalities. He explained, also, that almost all the states are mixed, from the point of nationality. From the west of Europe to the east, this is found to be true, and the farther east one goes the more mixed do the states become. Austria is the most mixed of all the states. There is no Austrian language, but there are nine languages, and six smaller nations or remnants of nations. In all of Germany there are eight nationalities besides the Germans, who have been independent, and who have their own literature. Turkey is an anomaly, a combination of various nations overthrown and kept down.  Since the eighteenth century there has been a continuing strong movement from each nation to have its own state. Because of the mixed peoples, there is much confusion. There are Roumanians in Austria, but there is a kingdom of Roumania. There are Southern Slavs, but there are also Serbia and Montenegro. It is natural that the Southern Slavs should want to be united as one state. So it is with Italy.  There was no justice in Poland being separated in three parts to serve the dynasties of Prussia, Russia and Austria. The Czecho-Slovaks of Austria and Hungary claimed a union. The national union consists in an endeavor to make the suppressed nations free, to unite them in their own states, and to readjust the states that exist; to force Austria and Prussia to give up the states that should be free.  In the future, said Doctor Masaryk, there are to be sharp ethnological boundaries. The Czecho-Slovaks will guarantee the minorities absolute equality, but they will keep the German part of their country, because there are many Bohemians in it and they do not trust the Germans.    CHAPTER IV  THE PLOTTER BEHIND THE SCENES  One factor alone caused the great war. It was not the assassination at Sarajevo, not the Slavic ferment of anti-Teutonism in Austria and the Balkans. The only cause of the world\\'s greatest war was the determination of the German High Command and the powerful circle surrounding it that \"Der Tag\" had arrived. The assassination at Sarajevo was only the peg for the pendant of war. Another peg would have been found inevitably had not the projection of that assassination presented itself as the excuse.  Germany\\'s military machine was ready. A gray-green uniform that at a distance would fade into misty obscurity had been devised after exhaustive experiments by optical, dye and cloth experts co-operating with the military high command. These uniforms had been standardized and fitted for the millions of men enrolled in Germany\\'s regular and reserve armies. Rifles, great pyramids of munitions, field kitchens, traveling post-offices, motor lorries, a network of military railways leading to the French and Belgian border, all these and more had been made ready. German soldiers had received instructions which enabled each man at a signal to go to an appointed place where he found everything in readiness for his long forced marches into the territory of Germany\\'s neighbors.  More than all this, Germany\\'s spy system, the most elaborate and unscrupulous in the history of mankind, had enabled the German High Command to construct in advance of the declaration of war concrete gun emplacements in Belgium and other invaded territory. The cellars of dwellings and shops rented or owned by German spies were camouflaged concrete foundations for the great guns of Austria and Germany. These emplacements were in exactly the right position for use against the fortresses of Germany\\'s foes. Advertisements and shop-signs were used by spies as guides for the marching German armies of invasion.   [Illustration: Painting of KAISER WILLIAM II.]   Copyright Press Illustrating Service.   KAISER WILLIAM II OF GERMANY   Posterity will regard him as more responsible than any other human   being for the sacrifice of millions of lives in the great war, as a   ruler who might have been beneficent and wise, but attempted to   destroy the liberties of mankind and to raise on their ruins an odious   despotism. To forgive him and to forget his terrible transgressions   would be to condone them.  [Illustration: Men marching past a band.]   Copyright Underwood and Underwood, N, Y.   FRANCIS JOSEPH I OF AUSTRIA, THE \"OLD EMPEROR,\" ON A STATE OCCASION.   Francis Joseph died before the war had settled the fate of the   Hapsburgs. The end came on November 21, 1916, in the sixty-eighth year   of his reign. His life was tragic. He lived to see his brother   executed, his Queen assassinated, and his only son a suicide, with   always before him the specter of the disintegration of his many-raced   empire.   In brief, Germany had planned for war. She was approximately ready for it. Under the shelter of such high-sounding phrases as \"We demand our place in the sun,\" and \"The seas must be free,\" the German people were educated into the belief that the hour of Germany\\'s destiny was at hand.   [Illustration: Map of Africa.]   GERMANY\\'S POSSESSIONS IN AFRICA PRIOR TO 1914   German psychologists, like other German scientists, had co-operated with the imperial militaristic government for many years to bring the Germanic mind into a condition of docility. So well did they understand the mentality and the trends of character of the German people that it was comparatively easy to impose upon them a militaristic system and philosophy by which the individual yielded countless personal liberties for the alleged good of the state. Rigorous and compulsory military service, unquestioning adherence to the doctrine that might makes right and a cession to \"the All-Highest,\" as the Emperor was styled, of supreme powers in the state, are some of the sufferances to which the German people submitted.  German propaganda abroad was quite as vigorous as at home, but infinitely less successful. The German High Command did not expect England to enter the war. It counted upon America\\'s neutrality with a leaning toward Germany. It believed that German colonization in South Africa and South America would incline these vast domains toward friendship for the Central empires. How mistaken the propagandists and psychologists were events have demonstrated.  It was this dream of world-domination by Teutonic kultur that supplied the motive leading to the world\\'s greatest war. Bosnia, an unwilling province of Austria-Hungary, at one time a province of Serbia and overwhelmingly Slavic in its population, had been seething for years with an anti-Teutonic ferment. The Teutonic court at Vienna, leading the minority Germanic party in Austria-Hungary, had been endeavoring to allay the agitation among the Bosnian Slavs. In pursuance of that policy, Archduke Francis Ferdinand, heir-presumptive to the thrones of Austria and Hungary, and his morganatic wife, Sophia Chotek, Duchess of Hohenberg, on June 28, 1914, visited Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia. On the morning of that day, while they were being driven through the narrow streets of the ancient town, a bomb was thrown at them, but they were uninjured. They were driven through the streets again in the afternoon, for purpose of public display. A student, just out of his \\'teens, one Gavrilo Prinzep, attacked the royal party with a magazine pistol and killed both the Archduke and his wife.  Here was the excuse for which Germany had waited. Here was the dawn of \"The Day.\" The Germanic court of Austria asserted that the crime was the result of a conspiracy, leading directly to the Slavic court of Serbia. The Serbians in their turn declared that they knew nothing of the assassination. They pointed out the fact that Sophia Chotek was a Slav, and that Francis Ferdinand was more liberal than any other member of the Austrian royal household, and finally, that he, more than any other member of the Austrian court, understood and respected the Slavic character and aspirations.  At six o\\'clock on the evening of July 23d, Austria sent an ultimatum to Serbia, presenting eleven demands and stipulating that categorical replies must be delivered before six o\\'clock on the evening of July 25th. Although the language in which the ultimatum was couched was humiliating to Serbia, the answer was duly delivered within the stipulated time.  The demands of the Austrian note in brief were as follows:  1. The Serbian Government to give formal assurance of its condemnation of Serb propaganda against Austria.  2. The next issue of the Serbian \"Official Journal\" was to contain a declaration to that effect.  3. This declaration to express regret that Serbian officers had taken part in the propaganda.  4. The Serbian Government to promise that it would proceed rigorously against all guilty of such activity.  5. This declaration to be at once communicated by the King of Serbia to his army, and to be published in the official bulletin as an order of the day.  6. All anti-Austrian publications in Serbia to be suppressed.  7. The Serbian political party known as the \"National Union\" to be suppressed, and its means of propaganda to be confiscated.  8. All anti-Austrian teaching in the schools of Serbia to be suppressed.  9. All officers, civil and military, who might be designated by Austria as guilty of anti-Austrian propaganda to be dismissed by the Serbian Government.  10. Austrian agents to co-operate with the Serbian Government in suppressing all anti-Austrian propaganda, and to take part in the judicial proceedings conducted in Serbia against those charged with complicity in the crime at Sarajevo.  11. Serbia to explain to Austria the meaning of anti-Austrian utterances of Serbian officials at home and abroad, since the assassination.  To the first and second demands Serbia unhesitatingly assented. To the third demand, Serbia assented, although no evidence was given to show that Serbian officers had taken part in the propaganda.  The Serbian Government assented to the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth demands also.  Extraordinary as was the ninth demand, which would allow the Austrian Government to proscribe Serbian officials, so eager for peace and friendship was the Serbian Government that it assented to it, with the stipulation that the Austrian Government should offer some proof of the guilt of the proscribed officers.  The tenth demand, which in effect allowed Austrian agents to control the police and courts of Serbia, it was not possible for Serbia to accept without abrogating her sovereignty. However, it was not unconditionally rejected, but the Serbian Government asked that it be made the subject of further discussion, or be referred to arbitration. The Serbian Government assented to the eleventh demand, on the condition that if the explanations which would be given concerning the alleged anti-Austrian utterances of Serbian officials would not prove satisfactory to the Austrian Government, the matter should be submitted to mediation or arbitration.  Behind the threat conveyed in the Austrian ultimatum was the menacing figure of militant Germany. The veil that had hitherto concealed the hands that worked the string, was removed when Germany, under the pretense of localizing the quarrel to Serbian and Austrian soil, interrogated France and England, asking them to prevent Russia from defending Serbia in the event of an attack by Austria upon the Serbs. England and France promptly refused to participate in a tragedy which would deliver Serbia to Austria as Bosnia had been delivered. Russia, bound by race and creed to Serbia, read into the ultimatum of Teutonic kultur a determination for warfare. Mobilization of the Russian forces along the Austrian frontier was arranged, when it was seen that Serbia\\'s pacific reply to Austria\\'s demands would be contemptuously disregarded by Germany and Austria.  During the days that intervened between the issuance of the ultimatum and the actual declaration of war by Germany against Russia on Saturday, August 1st, various sincere efforts were made to stave off the world-shaking catastrophe. Arranged chronologically, these events may thus be summarized: Russia, on July 24th, formally asked Austria if she intended to annex Serbian territory by way of reprisal for the assassination at Sarajevo. On the same day Austria replied that it had no present intention to make such annexation. Russia then requested an extension of the forty-eight-hour time-limit named in the ultimatum.  Austria, on the morning of Saturday, July 25th, refused Russia\\'s request for an extension of the period named in the ultimatum. On the same day, the newspapers published in Petrograd printed an official note issued by the Russian Government warning Europe generally that Russia would not remain indifferent to the fate of Serbia. These newspapers also printed the appeal of the Serbian Crown Prince to the Czar dated on the preceding day, urging that Russia come to the rescue of the menaced Serbs. Serbia\\'s peaceful reply surrendering on all points except one, and agreeing to submit that to arbitration, was sent late in the afternoon of the same day, and that night Austria declared the reply to be unsatisfactory and withdrew its minister from Belgrade.  England commenced its attempts at pacification on the following day, Sunday, July 26th. Sir Edward Grey spent the entire Sabbath in the Foreign Office and personally conducted the correspondence that was calculated to bring the dispute to a peaceful conclusion. He did not reckon, however, with a Germany determined upon war, a Germany whose manufacturers, ship-owners and Junkers had combined with its militarists to achieve \"Germany\\'s place in the sun\" even though the world would be stained in the blood of the most frightful war this earth has ever known. Realization of this fact did not come to Sir Edward Grey until his negotiations with Germany and with Austria-Hungary had proceeded for some time. His first suggestion was that the dispute between Russia and Austria be committed to the arbitration of Great Britain, France, Italy and Germany. Russia accepted this but Germany and Austria rejected it. Russia had previously suggested that the dispute be settled by a conference between the diplomatic heads at Vienna and Petrograd. This also was refused by Austria.  Sir Edward Grey renewed his efforts on Monday, July 27th, with an invitation to Germany to present suggestions of its own, looking toward a settlement. This note was never answered. Germany took the position that its proposition to compel Russia to stand aside while Austria punished Serbia had been rejected by England and France and it had nothing further to propose.  During all this period of negotiation the German Foreign Office, to all outward appearances at least, had been acting independently of the Kaiser, who was in Norway on a vacation trip. He returned to Potsdam on the night of Sunday, July 26th. On Monday morning the Czar of Russia received a personal message from the Kaiser, urging Russia to stand aside that Serbia might be punished. The Czar immediately replied with the suggestion that the whole matter be submitted to The Hague. No reply of any kind was ever made to this proposal by Germany.   [Illustration: THE GERMAN CONFEDERATION IN 1815 (Map: Baltic Sea on the North, Adriatic Sea on the South, Eastern France and Belgium on the West, Poland on the East.)]   All suggestions and negotiations looking forward to peace were brought to a tragic end on the following day, Tuesday, July 28th, when Austria declared war on Serbia, having speedily mobilized troops at strategic points on the Serbian border. Russian mobilization, which had been proceeding only in a tentative way, on the Austrian border, now became general, and on July 30th, mobilization of the entire Russian army was proclaimed.  Germany\\'s effort to exclude England from the war began on Thursday, July 29th. A note, sounding Sir Edward Grey on the question of British neutrality in the event of war was received, and a curt refusal to commit the British Empire to such a proposal was the reply. Sir Edward Grey, in a last determined effort to avoid a world-war, suggested to Germany, Austria, Serbia and Russia that the military operations commenced by Austria should be recognized as merely a punitive expedition. He further suggested that when a point in Serbian territory previously fixed upon should have been reached, Austria would halt and would submit her further action to arbitration in the conference of the Powers. Russia and Serbia agreed unreservedly to this proposition. Austria gave a half-hearted assent to the principle involved. Germany made no reply.  The die was cast for war on the following day, July 31st, when Germany made a dictatorial and arrogant demand upon Russia that mobilization of that nation\\'s military forces be stopped within twelve hours. Russia made no reply, and on Saturday, August 1st, Germany set the world aflame with the dread of war\\'s horror by her declaration of war upon Russia.  Germany\\'s responsibility for this monumental crime against the peace of the world is eternally fixed upon her, not only by these outward and visible acts and negotiations, not only by her years of patient preparation for the war into which she plunged the world. The responsibility is fastened upon her forever by the revelations of her own ambassador to England during this fateful period. Prince Lichnowsky, in a remarkable communication which was given to the world, laid bare the machinations of the German High Command and its advisers. He was a guest of the Kaiser at Kiel on board the Imperial yacht Meteor when the message was received informing the Kaiser of the assassination at Sarajevo. His story continues:   Being unacquainted with the Vienna viewpoint and what was going on there, I attached no very far-reaching significance to the event; but, looking back, I could feel sure that in the Austrian aristocracy a feeling of relief outweighed all others. His Majesty regretted that his efforts to win over the Archduke to his ideas had thus been frustrated by the Archduke\\'s assassination.  I went on to Berlin and saw the Chancellor, von Bethmann-Hollweg. I told him that I regarded our foreign situation as very satisfactory as it was a long time indeed since we had stood so well with England. And in France there was a pacifist cabinet. Herr von Bethmann-Hollweg did not seem to share my optimism.  He complained of the Russian armaments. I tried to tranquilize him with the argument that it was not to Russia\\'s interest to attack us, and that such an attack would never have English or French support, as both countries wanted peace.  I went from him to Dr. Zimmermann (the under Secretary) who was acting for Herr von Jagow (the Foreign Secretary), and learned from him that Russia was about to call up nine hundred thousand new troops. His words unmistakably denoted ill-humor against Russia, who, he said, stood everywhere in our way. In addition, there were questions of commercial policy that had to be settled. That General von Moltke was urging war was, of course, not told to me. I learned, however, that Herr von Tschirschky (the German Ambassador in Vienna) had been reproved because he said that he had advised Vienna to show moderation toward Serbia.   Prince Lichnowsky went to his summer home in Silesia, quite unaware of the impending crisis. He continues:   When I returned from Silesia on my way to London, I stopped only a few hours in Berlin, where I heard that Austria intended to proceed against Serbia so as to bring to an end an unbearable state of affairs. Unfortunately, I failed at the moment to gauge the significance of the news. I thought that once more it would come to nothing; that even if Russia acted threateningly, the matter could soon be settled. I now regret that I did not stay in Berlin and declare there and then that I would have no hand in such a policy.  There was a meeting in Potsdam, as early as July 5th, between the German and Austrian authorities, at which meeting war was decided on. Prince Lichnowsky says:  I learned afterwards that at the decisive discussion at Potsdam on July 5th the Austrian demand had met with the unconditional approval of all the personages in authority; it was even added that no harm would be done if war with Russia did come out of it. It was so stated at least in the Austrian report received at London by Count Mensdorff (the Austrian Ambassador to England).  At this point I received instructions to endeavor to bring the English press to a friendly attitude in case Austria should deal the death-blow to \"Greater-Serbian\" hopes. I was to use all my influence to prevent public opinion in England from taking a stand against Austria. I remembered England\\'s attitude during the Bosnian annexation crisis, when public opinion showed itself in sympathy with the Serbian claims to Bosnia; I recalled also the benevolent promotion of nationalist hopes that went on in the days of Lord Byron and Garibaldi; and on these and other grounds I thought it extremely unlikely that English public opinion would support a punitive expedition against the Archduke\\'s murderers. I thus felt it my duty to enter an urgent warning against the whole project, which I characterized as venturesome and dangerous, I recommended that counsels of moderation he given Austria, as I did not believe that the conflict could be localized (that is to say, it could not be limited to a war between Austria and Serbia).

[Illustration: Photograph of ex-Emperor Charles and ex-Empress Zita.]   Copyright Press Illustrating Service. THE DEPOSED RULERS OF   AUSTRIA-HUNGARY The ex-Emperor Charles and his wife, the ex-Empress   Zita, in deep conversation with Hungarian leaders who are explaining   the distressing situation confronting the country.   Herr von Jagow answered me that Russia was not prepared; that there would be more or less of a rumpus; but that the more firmly we stood by Austria, the more surely would Russia give way. Austria was already blaming us for flabbiness and we could not flinch. On the other hand, Russian sentiment was growing more unfriendly all the time, and we must simply take the risk. I subsequently learned that this attitude was based on advices from Count Pourtales (the German Ambassador in Petrograd), that Russia would not stir under any circumstances; information which prompted us to spur Count Berchtold on in his course. On learning the attitude of the German Government I looked for salvation through English mediation, knowing that Sir Edward Grey\\'s influence in Petrograd could be used in the cause of peace. I, therefore, availed myself of my friendly relations with the Minister to ask him confidentially to advise moderation in Russia in case Austria demanded satisfaction from the Serbians, as it seemed likely she would.  The English press was quiet at first, and friendly to Austria, the assassination being generally condemned. By degrees, however, more and more voices made themselves heard, in the sense that, however necessary it might be to take cognizance of the crime, any exploitation of it for political ends was unjustifiable. Moderation was enjoined upon Austria. When the ultimatum came out, all the papers, with the exception of the Standard, were unanimous in condemning it. The whole world, outside of Berlin and Vienna, realized that it meant war, and a world war too. The English fleet, which happened to have been holding a naval review, was not demobilized.   The British Government labored to make the Serbian reply conciliatory, and \"the Serbian answer was in keeping with the British efforts.\" Sir Edward Grey then proposed his plan of mediation upon the two points which Serbia had not wholly conceded. Prince Lichnowsky writes:   M. Cambon (for France), Marquis Imperiali (for Italy), and I were to meet, with Sir Edward in the chair, and it would have been easy to work out a formula for the debated points, which had to do with the co-operation of imperial and royal officials in the inquiries to be conducted at Belgrade. By the exercise of good will everything could have been settled in one or two sittings, and the mere acceptance of the British proposal would have relieved the strain and further improved our relations with England. I seconded this plan with all my energies. In vain. I was told (by Berlin) that it would be against the dignity of Austria. Of course, all that was needed was one hint from Berlin to Count Berchtold (the Austrian Foreign Minister); he would have satisfied himself with a diplomatic triumph and rested on the Serbian answer. That hint was never given. On the contrary, pressure was brought in favor of war....  After our refusal Sir Edward asked us to come forward with our proposal. We insisted on war. No other answer could I get (from Berlin) than that it was a colossal condescension on the part of Austria not to contemplate any acquisition of territory. Sir Edward justly pointed out that one could reduce a country to vassalage without acquiring territory; that Russia would see this, and regard it as a humiliation not to be put up with. The impression grew stronger and stronger that we were bent on war. Otherwise our attitude toward a question in which we were not directly concerned was incomprehensible. The insistent requests and well-defined declarations of M. Sasanof, the Czar\\'s positively humble telegrams, Sir Edward\\'s repeated proposals, the warnings of Marquis San Guiliano and of Bollati, my own pressing admonitions were all of no avail. Berlin remained inflexible--Serbia must be slaughtered.   Then, on the 29th, Sir Edward decided upon his well-known warning. I told him I had always reported (to Berlin) that we should have to reckon with English opposition if it came to a war with France. Time and again the Minister said to me, \"If war breaks out it will be the greatest catastrophe the world has ever seen.\" And now events moved rapidly. Count Berchtold at last decided to come around, having up to that point played the role of \"Strong man\" under guidance of Berlin. Thereupon we (in answer to Russia\\'s mobilization) sent our ultimatum and declaration of war--after Russia had spent a whole week in fruitless negotiation and waiting.  Thus ended my mission in London. It had suffered shipwreck, not on the wiles of the Briton but on the wiles of our own policy. Were not those right who saw that the German people was pervaded with the spirit of Treitschke and Bernhardi, which glorifies war as an end instead of holding it in abhorrence as an evil thing? Properly speaking militarism is a school for the people and an instrument to further political ends. But in the patriarchal absolutism of a military monarchy, militarism exploits politics to further its own ends, and can create a situation which a democracy freed from junkerdom would not tolerate.  That is what our enemies think; that is what they are bound to think when they see that in spite of capitalistic industrialism, and in spite of socialistic organizations, the living, as Nietzsche said, are still ruled by the dead. The democratization of Germany, the first war aim proposed by our enemies, will become a reality.  This is the frank statement of a great German statesman made long before Germany received its knock-out blow. It was written when Germany was sweeping all before it on land, and when the U-boat was at the height of its murderous powers on the high seas. No one in nor out of Germany has controverted any of its statements and it will forever remain as one of the counts in the indictment against Germany and the sole cause of the world\\'s greatest misery, the war.  America\\'s outstanding authority on matters of international conduct, former Secretary of State Elihu Root declared that the World War was a mighty and all-embracing struggle between two conflicting principles of human right and human duty; it was a conflict between the divine right of kings to govern mankind through armies and nobles, and the right of the peoples of the earth who toil and endure and aspire to govern themselves by law under justice, and in the freedom of individual manhood.  After the declaration of war against Russia by Germany, events marched rapidly and inevitably toward the general conflagration. Germany\\'s most strenuous efforts were directed toward keeping England out of the conflict. We have seen in the revelations of Prince Lichnowsky how eager was England to divert Germany\\'s murderous purpose. There are some details, however, required to fill in the diplomatic picture.  President Poincare, of the French Republic, on July 30th, asked the British Ambassador in Paris for an assurance of British support. On the following day he addressed a similar letter to King George of England. Both requests were qualifiedly refused on the ground that England wished to be free to continue negotiations with Germany for the purpose of averting the war. In the meantime, the German Government addressed a note to England offering guarantees for Belgian integrity, providing Belgium did not side with France, offering to respect the neutrality of Holland and giving assurance that no French territory in Europe would be annexed if Germany won the war. Sir Edward Grey described this as a \"shameful proposal,\" and rejected it on July 30th.  On July 31st England sent a note to France and Germany asking for a statement of purpose concerning Belgian neutrality. France immediately announced that it would respect the treaty of 1839 and its reaffirmation in 1870 guaranteeing Belgium\\'s neutrality. This treaty was entered into by Germany, England, France, Austria and Russia. Germany\\'s reply on August 1st was a proposal that she would respect the neutrality of Belgium if England would stay out of the war. This was promptly declined. On August 2d the British cabinet agreed that if the German fleet attempted to attack the coast of France the British fleet would intervene. Germany, the next day, sent a note agreeing to refrain from naval attacks on France provided England would remain neutral, but declined to commit herself as to the neutrality of Belgium. Before this, however, on August 2d, Germany had announced to Belgium its intention to enter Belgium for the purpose of attacking France. The Belgian Minister in London made an appeal to the British Foreign Office and was informed that invasion of Belgium by Germany would be followed by England\\'s declaration of war. Monday, August 3d, was signalized by Belgium\\'s declaration of its neutrality and its firm purpose to defend its soil against invasion by France, England, Germany or any other nation.  The actual invasion of Belgium commenced on the morning of August 4th, when twelve regiments of Uhlans crossed the frontier near Vise, and came in contact with a Belgian force driving it back upon Liege. King Albert of Belgium promptly appealed to England, Russia and France for aid in repelling the invader. England sent an ultimatum to Germany fixing midnight of August 4th as the time for expiration of the ultimatum. This demanded that satisfactory assurances be furnished immediately that Germany would respect the neutrality of Belgium. No reply was made by Germany and England\\'s declaration of war followed.  Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg, of the German Empire, wrote Germany\\'s infamy into history when, in a formal statement, he acknowledged that the invasion of Belgium was \"a wrong that we will try to make good again as soon as our military ends have been reached.\" To Sir Edward Vochen, British Ambassador to Germany, he addressed the inquiry: \"Is it the purpose of your country to make war upon Germany for the sake of a scrap of paper?\" The treaty of 1839-1870 guaranteeing Belgium\\'s neutrality was the scrap of paper.

THE RED RUINS OF YPRES   Ypres, the British soldiers \"Wipers,\" was the scene of much of the   bloodiest fighting of the war. Three great battles were fought for its   possession. The photograph shows what was once the market place.  With the entrance of England into the war, the issue between autocracy and democracy was made plain before the people of the world.

CHAPTER V  THE GREAT WAR BEGINS  Years before 1914, when Germany declared war against civilization, it was decided by the German General Staff to strike at France through Belgium. The records of the German Foreign Office prove that fact. The reason for this lay in the long line of powerful fortresses along the line that divides France from Germany and the sparsely spaced and comparatively out-of-date forts on the border between Germany and Belgium. True, there was a treaty guaranteeing the inviolability of Belgian territory to which Germany was a signatory party. Some of the clauses of that treaty were:   Article 9. Belgium, within the limits traced in conformity with the principles laid down in the present preliminaries, shall form a perpetually neutral state. The five powers (England, France, Austria, Prussia and Russia), without wishing to intervene in the internal affairs of Belgium, guarantee her that perpetual neutrality as well as the integrity and inviolability of her territory in the limits mentioned in the present article.  Article 10. By just reciprocity Belgium shall be held to observe this same neutrality toward all the other states and to make no attack on their internal or external tranquillity while always preserving the right to defend herself against any foreign aggression.   This agreement was followed on January 23, 1839, by a definitive treaty, accepted by Belgium and by the Netherlands, which treaty regulates Belgium\\'s neutrality as follows:   Article 7. Belgium, within the limits defined in Articles 1, 2 and 4 shall form an independent and perpetually neutral state. She is obligated to preserve this neutrality against all the other states.   To convert this solemn covenant into a \"scrap of paper\" it was necessary that Germany should find an excuse for tearing it to pieces. There was absolutely no provocation in sight, but that did not deter the German High Command. That august body with no information whatever to afford an excuse, alleged in a formal note to the Belgian Government that the French army intended to invade Germany through Belgian territory. This hypocritical and mendacious note and Belgium\\'s vigorous reply follow:   Note handed in on August 2, 1914, at 7 o\\'clock P. M., by Herr von Below-Saleske, German Minister, to M. Davignon, Belgian Minister for Foreign Affairs.   BRUSSELS, 2d August, 1914. IMPERIAL GERMAN LEGATION IN BELGIUM (Highly confidential)  The German Government has received reliable information according to which the French forces intend to march on the Meuse, by way of Givet and Namur. This information leaves no doubt as to the intention of France of marching on Germany through Belgian territory. The Imperial Government cannot avoid the fear that Belgium, in spite of its best will, will be in no position to repulse such a largely developed French march without aid. In this fact there is sufficient certainty of a threat directed against Germany.  It is an imperative duty for the preservation of Germany to forestall this attack of the enemy.  The German Government would feel keen regret if Belgium should regard as an act of hostility against herself the fact that the measures of the enemies of Germany oblige her on her part to violate Belgian territory. In order to dissipate any misunderstanding the German Government declares as follows:  1. Germany does not contemplate any act of hostility against Belgium. If Belgium consents in the war about to commence to take up an attitude of friendly neutrality toward Germany, the German Government on its part undertakes, on the declaration of peace, to guarantee the kingdom and its possessions in their whole extent.  2. Germany undertakes under the conditions laid down to evacuate Belgian territory as soon as peace is concluded.  3. If Belgium preserves a friendly attitude, Germany is prepared, in agreement with the authorities of the Belgian Government, to buy against cash all that is required by her troops, and to give indemnity for the damages caused in Belgium.  4. If Belgium behaves in a hostile manner toward the German troops, and in particular raises difficulties against their advance by the opposition of the fortifications of the Meuse, or by destroying roads, railways, tunnels, or other engineering works, Germany will be compelled to consider Belgium as an enemy.   In this case Germany will take no engagements toward Belgium, but she will leave the later settlement of relations of the two states toward one another to the decision of arms. The German Government has a justified hope that this contingency will not arise and that the Belgian Government will know how to take suitable measures to hinder its taking place. In this case the friendly relations which unite the two neighboring states will become closer and more lasting.   THE REPLY BY BELGIUM Note handed in by M. Davignon, Minister for Foreign Affairs, to Herr von Below-Saleske, German Minister.   BRUSSELS, 3d August, 1914. (7 o\\'clock in the morning.)  By the note of the 2d August, 1914, the German Government has made known that according to certain intelligence the French forces intend to march on the Meuse via Givet and Namur and that Belgium, in spite of her good-will, would not be able without help to beat off an advance of the French troops.  The German Government felt it to be its duty to forestall this attack and to violate Belgian territory. Under these conditions Germany proposes to the King\\'s Government to take up a friendly attitude, and undertakes at the moment of peace to guarantee the integrity of the kingdom and of her possessions in their whole extent. The note adds that if Belgium raises difficulties to the forward march of the German troops Germany will be compelled to consider her as an enemy and to leave the later settlement of the two states toward one another to the decision of arms.  This note caused profound and painful surprise to the King\\'s Government.  The intentions which it attributed to France are in contradiction with the express declarations which were made to us on the 1st of August, in the name of the government of the republic.  Moreover, if, contrary to our expectation, a violation of Belgian neutrality were to be committed by France, Belgium would fulfil all her international duties and her army would offer the most vigorous opposition to the invader.  The treaties of 1839, confirmed by the treaties of 1870, establish the independence and the neutrality of Belgium under the guarantee of the powers, and particularly of the Government of his Majesty the King of Prussia.  Belgium has always been faithful to her international obligations; she has fulfilled her duties in a spirit of loyal impartiality; she has neglected no effort to maintain her neutrality or to make it respected.  The attempt against her independence with which the German Government threatens her would constitute a flagrant violation of international law. No strategic interest justifies the violation of that law.  The Belgian Government would, by accepting the propositions which are notified to her, sacrifice the honor of the nation while at the same time betraying her duties toward Europe.  Conscious of the part Belgium has played for more than eighty years in the civilization of the world, she refuses to believe that the independence of Belgium can be preserved only at the expense of the violation of her neutrality.  If this hope were disappointed the Belgian Government has firmly resolved to repulse by every means in her power any attack upon her rights.   The German attack upon Belgium and France came with terrible force and suddenness. Twenty-four army corps, divided into three armies clad in a specially designed and colored gray-green uniform, swept in three mighty streams over the German borders with their objective the heart of France. The Army of the Meuse was given the route through Liege, Namur and Maubeuge. The Army of the Moselle violated the Duchy of Luxemburg, which, under a treaty guaranteeing its independence and neutrality, was not permitted to maintain an army. Germany was a signatory party to this treaty also. The Army of the Rhine cut through the Vosges Mountains and its route lay between the French cities of Nancy and Toul.  The heroic defense of the Belgian army at Liege against the Army of the Meuse delayed the operation of Germany\\'s plans and in all probability saved Paris. It was the first of many similar disappointments and checks that Germany encountered during the war.  The defense of Liege continued for ten heroic days. Within that interval the first British Expeditionary Forces were landed in France and Belgium, the French army was mobilized to full strength. The little Belgian army falling back northward on Antwerp, Louvain and Brussels, threatened the German flank and approximately 200,000 German soldiers were compelled to remain in the conquered section of Belgium to garrison it effectively.  Liege fortifications were the design of the celebrated strategist Brialmont. They consisted of twelve isolated fortresses which had been permitted to become out of repair. No field works of any kind connected them and they were without provision for defense against encircling tactics and against modern artillery.  The huge 42-centimeter guns, the first of Germany\\'s terrible surprises, were brought into action against these forts, and their concrete and armored steel turrets were cracked as walnuts are cracked between the jaws of a nut-cracker. The Army of the Meuse then made its way like a gray-green cloud of poison gas through Belgium. A cavalry screen of crack Uhlan regiments preceded it, and it made no halt worthy of note until it confronted the Belgian army on the line running from Louvain to Namur. The Belgians were forced back before Louvain on August 20th, the Belgian Government removed the capital from Brussels to Antwerp, and the German hosts entered evacuated Brussels.  During this advance of the Army of the Meuse, strong French detachments invaded German soil, pouring into Alsace through the Belfort Gap. Brief successes attended the bold stroke. Mulhausen was captured and the Metz-Strassburg Railroad was cut in several places. The French suffered a defeat almost immediately following this first flush of victory, both in Alsace and in Lorraine, where a French detachment had engaged with the Army of the Moselle. The French army thereupon retreated to the strong line of forts and earthworks defending the border between France and Germany.  England\\'s first expeditionary force landed at Ostend, Calais and Dunkirk on August 7th. It was dubbed England\\'s \"contemptible little army\" by the German General Staff. That name was seized upon gladly by England as a spur to volunteering. It brought to the surface national pride and a fierce determination to compel Germany to recognize and to reckon with the \"contemptible little army.\"  The contact between the French, Belgian and British forces was speedily established and something like concerted resistance to the advance of the enemy was made possible. The German army, however, followed by a huge equipment of motor kitchens, munition trains, and other motor transport evidencing great care in preparation for the movement, swept resistlessly forward until it encountered the French and British on a line running from Mons to Charleroi.  The British army was assigned to a position between two French armies. By some miscalculation, the French army that was to have taken its position on the British left, never appeared. The French army on the right was attacked and defeated at Charleroi, falling back in some confusion. The German Army of the Moselle co-operating with the Army of the Meuse then attacked the British and French, and a great flanking movement by the German joint commands developed.  This was directed mainly at the British under command of Sir John French. There followed a retreat that for sheer heroism and dogged determination has become one of the great battles of all time. The British, outflanked and outnumbered three to one, fought and marched without cessation for six days and nights. Time after time envelopment and disaster threatened them, but with a determination that would not be beaten they fought off the best that Germany could send against them, maintained contact with the French army on their right, and delayed the German advance so effectively that a complete disarrangement of all the German plans ensued. This was the second great disappointment to Germany. It made possible the victory of the Marne and the victorious peace of 1918. The story of that immortal retreat is best told in the words of Sir John French, transmitting the report of this encounter to the British War Office:  \"The transport of the troops from England both by sea and by rail was effected in the best order and without a check. Each unit arrived at its destination well within the scheduled time.  \"The concentration was practically complete on the evening of Friday, the 21st ultimo, and I was able to make dispositions to move the force during Saturday, the 22d, to positions I considered most favorable from which to commence operations which the French commander-in-chief, General Joffre, requested me to undertake in pursuance of his plans in prosecution of the campaign.  \"The line taken up extended along the line of the canal from Conde on the west, through Mons and Binche on the east. This line was taken up as follows:  \"From Conde to Mons, inclusive, was assigned to the Second Corps, and to the right of the Second Corps from Mons the First Corps was posted. The Fifth Cavalry Brigade was placed at Binche.  \"In the absence of my Third Army Corps I desired to keep the cavalry divisions as much as possible as a reserve to act on my outer flank, or move in support of any threatened part of the line. The forward reconnoissance was intrusted to Brig.-Gen. Sir Philip Chetwode, with the Fifth Cavalry Brigade, but I directed General Allenby to send forward a few squadrons to assist in this work.  \"During the 22d and 23d these advanced squadrons did some excellent work, some of them penetrating as far as Soignies, and several encounters took place in which our troops showed to great advantage.  \"2. At 6 A. M., on August 23d, I assembled the commanders of the First and Second Corps and cavalry division at a point close to the position and explained the general situation of the Allies, and what I understood to be General Joffre\\'s plan. I discussed with them at some length the immediate situation in front of us.  \"From information I received from French headquarters I understood that little more than one, or at most two, of the enemy\\'s army corps, with perhaps one cavalry division, were in front of my position; and I was aware of no attempted outflanking movement by the enemy. I was confirmed in this opinion by the fact that my patrols encountered no undue opposition in their reconnoitering operations. The observations of my airplanes seemed to bear out this estimate.  \"About 3 P. M. on Sunday, the 23d, reports began coming in to the effect that the enemy was commencing an attack on the Mons line, apparently in some strength, but that the right of the position from Mons and Bray was being particularly threatened.  \"The commander of the First Corps had pushed his flank back to some high ground south of Bray, and the Fifth Cavalry Brigade evacuated Binche, moving slightly south; the enemy thereupon occupied Binche.  \"The right of the Third Division, under General Hamilton, was at Mons, which formed a somewhat dangerous salient; and I directed the commander of the Second Corps to be careful not to keep the troops on this salient too long, but, if threatened seriously, to draw back the center behind Mons. This was done before dark. In the meantime, about 5 P. M., I received a most unexpected message from General Joffre by telegraph, telling me that at least three German corps, viz., a reserve corps, the Fourth Corps and the Ninth Corps, were moving on my position in front, and that the Second Corps was engaged in a turning movement from the direction of Tournay. He also informed me that the two reserve French divisions and the Fifth French army on my right were retiring, the Germans having on the previous day gained possession of the passages of the Sambre, between Charleroi and Namur.  \"3. In view of the possibility of my being driven from the Mons position, I had previously ordered a position in rear to be reconnoitered. This position rested on the fortress of Maubeuge on the right and extended west to Jenlain, southeast to Valenciennes, on the left. The position was reported difficult to hold, because standing crops and buildings made the placing of trenches very difficult and limited the field of fire in many important localities. It nevertheless afforded a few good artillery positions.  \"When the news of the retirement of the French and the heavy German threatening on my front reached me, I endeavored to confirm it by airplane reconnoissance; and as a result of this I determined to effect a retirement to the Maubeuge position at daybreak on the 24th.  \"A certain amount of fighting continued along the whole line throughout the night and at daybreak on the 24th the Second Division from the neighborhood of Harmignies made a powerful demonstration as if to retake Binche. This was supported by the artillery of both the First and Second Divisions, while the First Division took up a supporting position in the neighborhood of Peissant. Under cover of this demonstration the Second Corps retired on the line Dour-Quarouble-Frameries. The Third Division on the right of the corps suffered considerable loss in this operation from the enemy, who had retaken Mons.  \"The Second Corps halted on this line, where they partially intrenched themselves, enabling Sir Douglas Haig with the First Corps gradually to withdraw to the new position; and he effected this without much further loss, reaching the line Bavai-Maubeuge about 7 P. M. Toward midday the enemy appeared to be directing his principal effort against our left.  \"I had previously ordered General Allenby with the cavalry to act vigorously in advance of my left front and endeavor to take the pressure off.  \"About 7.30 A. M. General Allenby received a message from Sir Charles Ferguson, commanding the Fifth Division, saying that he was very hard pressed and in urgent need of support. On receipt of this message General Allenby drew in the cavalry and endeavored to bring direct support to the Fifth Division.  \"During the course of this operation General De Lisle, of the Second Cavalry Brigade, thought he saw a good opportunity to paralyze the further advance of the enemy\\'s infantry by making a mounted attack on his flank. He formed up and advanced for this purpose, but was held up by wire about five hundred yards from his objective, and the Ninth Lancers and the Eighteenth Hussars suffered severely in the retirement of the brigade.  \"The Nineteenth Infantry Brigade, which had been guarding the line of communications, was brought up by rail to Valenciennes on the 22d and 23d. On the morning of the 24th they were moved out to a position south of Quarouble to support the left flank of the Second Corps.  \"With the assistance of the cavalry Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien was enabled to effect his retreat to a new position; although, having two corps of the enemy on his front and one threatening his flank, he suffered great losses in doing so.  \"At nightfall the position was occupied by the Second Corps to the west of Bavai, the First Corps to the right. The right was protected by the Fortress of Maubeuge, the left by the Nineteenth Brigade in position between Jenlain and Bry, and the cavalry on the outer flank.  \"4. The French were still retiring, and I had no support except such as was afforded by the Fortress of Maubeuge; and the determined attempts of the enemy to get round my left flank assured me that it was his intention to hem me against that place and surround me. I felt that not a moment must be lost in retiring to another position.  \"I had every reason to believe that the enemy\\'s forces were somewhat exhausted and I knew that they had suffered heavy losses. I hoped, therefore, that his pursuit would not be too vigorous to prevent me effecting my object.  \"The operation, however, was full of danger and difficulty, not only owing to the very superior force in my front, but also to the exhaustion of the troops.  \"The retirement was recommenced in the early morning of the 25th to a position in the neighborhood of Le Cateau, and rearguards were ordered to be clear of the Maubeuge-Bavai-Eih Road by 5.30 A. M.  \"Two cavalry brigades, with the divisional cavalry of the Second Corps, covered the movement of the Second Corps. The remainder of the cavalry division, with the Nineteenth Brigade, the whole under the command of General Allenby, covered the west flank.  \"The Fourth Division commenced its detrainment at Le Cateau on Sunday, the 23d, and by the morning of the 25th eleven battalions and a brigade of artillery with divisional staff were available for service.  \"I ordered General Snow to move out to take up a position with his right south of Solesmes, his left resting on the Cambrai-LeCateau Road south of La Chaprie. In this position the division tendered great help to the effective retirement of the Second and First Corps to the new position.  \"Although the troops had been ordered to occupy the Cambrai-Le Cateau-Landrecies position, and the ground had, during the 25th, been partially prepared and intrenched, I had grave doubts, owing to the information I had received as to the accumulating strength of the enemy against me--as to the wisdom of standing there to fight.  \"Having regard to the continued retirement of the French on my right, my exposed left flank, the tendency of the enemy\\'s western corps (II) to envelop me, and, more than all, the exhausted condition of the troops, I determined to make a great effort to continue the retreat until I could put some substantial obstacle, such as the Somme or the Oise, between my troops and the enemy, and afford the former some opportunity of rest and reorganization. Orders were, therefore, sent to the corps commanders to continue their retreat as soon as they possibly could toward the general line Vermand-St. Quentin-Ribemont.  \"The cavalry under General Allenby, were ordered to cover the retirement.  \"Throughout the 25th and far into the evening, the First Corps continued its march on Landrecies, following the road along the eastern border of the Foret de Mormal, and arrived at Landrecies about 10 o\\'clock. I had intended that the corps should come further west so as to fill up the gap between Le Cateau and Landrecies, but the men were exhausted and could not get further in without rest.  \"The enemy, however, would not allow them this rest, and about 9.30 P. M. a report was received that the Fourth Guards Brigade in Landrecies was heavily attacked by troops of the Ninth German Army Corps, who were coming through the forest on the north of the town. This brigade fought most gallantly, and caused the enemy to suffer tremendous loss in issuing from the forest into the narrow streets of the town. This loss has been estimated from reliable sources at from 700 to 1,000. At the same time information reached me from Sir Douglas Haig that his First Division was also heavily engaged south and east of Maroilles. I sent urgent messages to the commander of the two French reserve divisions on my right to come up to the assistance of the First Corps, which they eventually did. Partly owing to this assistance, but mainly to the skilful manner in which Sir Douglas Haig extricated his corps from an exceptionally difficult position in the darkness of the night, they were able at dawn to resume their march south toward Wassigny on Guise.  \"By about 6 P. M. the Second Corps had got into position with their right on Le Cateau, their left in the neighborhood of Caudry, and the line of defense was continued thence by the Fourth Division toward Seranvillers, the left being thrown back.  \"During the fighting on the 24th and 25th the cavalry became a good deal scattered, but by the early morning of the 26th, General Allenby had succeeded in concentrating two brigades to the south of Cambrai.  \"The Fourth Division was placed under the orders of the general officer commanding the Second Army Corps.  \"On the 24th the French Cavalry Corps, consisting of three divisions under General Sordet, had been in billets north of Avesnes. On my way back from Bavai, which was my \\'Poste de Commandement\\' during the fighting of the 23d and 24th, I visited General Sordet, and earnestly requested his co-operation and support. He promised to obtain sanction from his army commander to act on my left flank, but said that his horses were too tired to move before the next day. Although he rendered me valuable assistance later on in the course of the retirement, he was unable, for the reasons given, to afford me any support on the most critical day of all, viz., the 26th.  \"At daybreak it became apparent that the enemy was throwing the bulk of his strength against the left of the position occupied by the Second Corps and the Fourth Division.  \"At this time the guns of four German army corps were in position against them, and Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien reported to me that he judged it impossible to continue his retirement at daybreak (as ordered) in face of such an attack.  \"I sent him orders to use his utmost endeavors to break off the action and retire at the earliest possible moment, as it was impossible for me to send him any support, the First Corps being at the moment incapable of movement.  \"The French Cavalry Corps, under General Sordet, was coming up on our left rear early in the morning, and I sent an urgent message to him to do his utmost to come up and support the retirement of my left flank; but owing to the fatigue of his horses he found himself unable to intervene in any way.  \"There had been no time to intrench the position properly, but the troops showed a magnificent front to the terrible fire which confronted them.  \"The artillery, although outmatched by at least four to one, made a splendid fight, and inflicted heavy losses on their opponents.  \"At length it became apparent that, if complete annihilation was to be avoided, a retirement must be attempted; and the order was given to commence it about 3.30 P. M. The movement was covered with the most devoted intrepidity and determination by the artillery, which had itself suffered heavily, and the fine work done by the cavalry in the further retreat from the position assisted materially in the final completion of this most difficult and dangerous operation.  \"Fortunately the enemy had himself suffered too heavily to engage in an energetic pursuit.  \"I cannot close the brief account of this glorious stand of the British troops without putting on record my deep appreciation of the valuable services rendered by Gen. Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien.  \"I say without hesitation that the saving of the left wing of the army under my command on the morning of the 26th of August, could never have been accomplished unless a commander of rare and unusual coolness, intrepidity, and determination had been present to personally conduct the operation.  \"The retreat was continued far into the night of the 26th and through the 27th and 28th, on which date the troops halted on the line Noyon-Chauny-LaFere, having then thrown off the weight of the enemy\\'s pursuit.  \"On the 27th and 28th I was much indebted to General Sordet and the French Cavalry Division which he commands for materially assisting my retirement and successfully driving back some of the enemy on Cambrai.  \"This closes the period covering the heavy fighting which commenced at Mons on Sunday afternoon, 23d August, and which really constituted a four days\\' battle.  \"It is impossible for me to speak too highly of the skill evinced by the two general officers commanding army corps; the self-sacrificing and devoted exertions of their staffs; the direction of the troops by divisional, brigade, and regimental leaders; the command of the smaller units by their officers; and the magnificent fighting spirit displayed by non-commissioned officers and men.  \"I wish particularly to bring to your Lordship\\'s notice the admirable work done by the Royal Flying Corps under Sir David Henderson. Their skill, energy, and perseverance have been beyond all praise. They have furnished me with the most complete and accurate information, which has been of incalculable value in the conduct of the operations. Fired at constantly both by friend and foe, and not hesitating to fly in every kind of weather, they have remained undaunted throughout.  \"Further, by actually fighting in the air, they have succeeded in destroying five of the enemy\\'s machines.\"  The combined French and British armies, including the forces that had retreated from Alsace and Lorraine, gave way with increasing stubbornness before von Kluck. That German general disregarding the fortresses surrounding Paris, swung southward to make a junction with the Army of the Crown Prince of Germany advancing through the Vosges Mountains. General Manoury\\'s army opposed the German advance on the entrenched line of Paris. General Gallieni commanding the garrison of Paris, was ready with a novel mobile transport consisting of taxicabs and fast trucks. The total number of soldiers in the French and British armies now outnumbered those in the German armies opposed to them.  General Joffre, in supreme command of the French, had chosen the battleground. He had set the trap with consummate skill. The word was given; the trap was sprung; and the first battle of the Marne came as a crashing surprise to Germany.    CHAPTER VI  THE TRAIL OF THE BEAST IN BELGIUM  Germany\\'s onrush into heroic Belgium speedily resolved itself into a saturnalia that drenched the land with blood and roused the civilized world into resentful horror. As the tide of barbarity swept forward into Northern France, stories of the horrors filtered through the close web of German censorship. There were denials at first by German propagandists. In the face of truth furnished by thousands of witnesses, the denials faded away.  What caused these atrocities? Were they the spontaneous expression of dormant brutishness in German soldiers? Were they a sudden reversion of an entire nation to bestiality?  The answer is that the private soldier as an individual was not responsible. The carnage, the rapine, the wholesale desolation was an integral part of the German policy of schrecklichkeit or frightfulness. This policy was laid down by Germany as part of its imperial war code. In 1902 Germany issued a new war manual entitled \"Kriegsbrauch im Landkriege.\" In it is written this cold-blooded declaration:   All measures which conduce to the attainment of the object of war are permissible and these may be summarized in the two ideas of violence and cunning. What is permissible includes every means of war without which the object of the war cannot be attained. All means which modern invention affords, including the fullest, most dangerous, and most massive means of destruction, may be utilized.   Brand Whitlock, United States Minister to Belgium, in a formal report to the State Department, made this statement concerning Germany\\'s policy in permitting these outrages:  \"All these deliberate organized massacres of civilians, all these murders and outrages, the violation of women, the killing of children, wanton destruction, burning, looting and pillage, and whole towns destroyed, were acts for which no possible military necessity can be pleaded. They were wilfully committed as part of a deliberately prepared and scientifically organized policy of terrorism.\"   [Illustration: Painting]   From a Painting by F. Gueldry to illustrate an official report.   GERMAN ATROCITIES   At Senlis, Department of Oise, on September 2,1914, French captives   were made to walk in the open so as to be hit by French bullets. Many   were killed and wounded. The townsman on the left was struck in the   knee. A German officer asked to see the wound and shot him through the   shoulder. On the right a German officer is seen torturing a wounded   French soldier by beating him in the face with a stick.   [Illustration: Photographs]   Copyright Underwood and Underwood, N. Y.   THE SUPREME EXPONENTS OF GERMAN FRIGHTFULNESS   On the left, General van Bossing, military commander of Belgium. On   the right, Grand Admiral van Tirpitz, who inspired the German   submarine campaign.    THE TRAIL OF THE BEAST IN BELGIUM   91  And now, having considered these outrages as part of the German policy of terrorism, let us turn to the facts presented by those who made investigations at first hand in devastated Belgium and Northern France.  Let us first turn to the tragic story of the destruction of Louvain. The first document comes in the form of a cable sent from the Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs under date of August 8,1914:   \"On Tuesday evening a body of German troops who had been driven back retired in disorder upon the town of Louvain. Germans who were guarding the town thought that the retiring troops were Belgians and fired upon them. In order to excuse this mistake the Germans, in spite of the most energetic denials on the part of the authorities, pretended that Belgians had fired on the Germans, although all the inhabitants, including policemen, had been disarmed for more than a week. Without any examination and without listening to any protest the commanding officer announced that the town would be immediately destroyed. All inhabitants had to leave their homes at once; some were made prisoners; women and children were put into a train of which the destination was unknown; soldiers with fire bombs set fire to the different quarters of the town; the splendid Church of St. Pierre, the markets, the university and its scientific establishments, were given to the flames, and it is probable that the Hotel de Ville, this celebrated jewel of Gothic art, will also have disappeared in the disaster. Several notabilities were shot at sight. Thus a town of 40,000 inhabitants, which, since the fifteenth century, has been the intellectual and scientific capital of the Low Countries is a heap of ashes. Americans, many of whom have followed the course at this illustrious alma mater and have there received such cordial hospitality, cannot remain insensible to this outrage on the rights of humanity and civilization which is unprecedented in history.\"   Minister Whitlock made the following report on the same outrage:   \"A violent fusillade broke out simultaneously at various points in the city (Louvain), notably at the Porte de Bruxelles, Porte de Tirlemont, Rue Leopold, Rue Marie-Therese, Rue des Joyeuses Entrees. German soldiers were firing at random in every street and in every direction. Later fires broke out everywhere, notably in the University building, the Library, in the old Church of St. Peter, in the Place du Peuple, in the Rue de la Station, in the Boulevard de Tirlemont, and in the Chaussee de Tirlemont. On the orders of their chiefs, the German soldiers would break open the houses and set fire to them, shooting on the inhabitants who tried to leave their dwellings. Many persons who took refuge in their cellars were burned to death. The German soldiers were equipped with apparatus for the purpose of firing dwellings, incendiary pastils, machines for spraying petroleum, etc. . . .  \"Major von Manteuffel (of the German forces) sent for Alderman Schmidt. Upon the latter\\'s arrival, the major declared that hostages were to be held, as sedition had just broken out. He asked Father Parijs, Mr. Schmidt, and Mgr. Coenraedts, First Vice-Rector of the University, who was being held as a hostage, to make proclamations to the inhabitants exhorting them to be calm and menacing them with a fine of twenty million francs, the destruction of the city and the hanging of the hostages, if they created disturbance. Surrounded by about thirty soldiers and a few officers, Major Manteuffel, Father Parijs, Mr. Schmidt and Mgr. Coenraedts left in the direction of the station, and the alderman, in French, and the priest, in Flemish, made proclamations at the street corners.. . .  \"Near the statue of Juste-Lipse, a Dr. Berghausen, a German surgeon, in a highly excited condition, ran to meet the delegation. He shouted that a German soldier had just been killed by a shot fired from the house of Mr. David Fishbach. Addressing the soldiers, Dr. Berghausen said: \\'The blood of the entire population of Louvain is not worth a drop of the blood of a German soldier!\\' Then one of the soldiers threw into the interior of the house of Mr. Fishbach one of the pastils which the German soldiers carried and immediately the house flared up. It contained paintings of a high value. The old coachman, Joseph Vandermosten, who had re-entered the house to try to save the life of his master, did not return. His body was found the next day amidst the ruins. . . .  \"The Germans made the usual claim that the civil population had fired upon them and that it was necessary to take these measures, i. e., burn the churches, the library and other public monuments, burn and pillage houses, driving out and murdering the inhabitants, sacking the city in order to punish and to spread terror among the people, and General von Luttwitz had told me that it was reported that the son of the burgomaster had shot one of their generals. But the burgomaster of Louvain had no son and no officer was shot at Louvain. The story of a general shot by the son of a burgomaster was a repetition of a tragedy that had occurred at Aerschot, on the 19th, where the fifteen-year-old son of the burgomaster had been killed by a firing squad, not because he had shot a general, but because an officer had been shot, probably by Belgian soldiers retreating through the town. The story of this tragedy is told by the boy\\'s mother, under oath, before the Belgian Commission, and is so simple, so touching, so convincing in its verisimilitude, that I attach a copy of it in extenso to this report. It seems to afford an altogether typical example of what went on all over the stricken land during those days of terror. (In other places it was the daughter of the burgomaster who was said to have shot a general.)  \"The following facts may be noted: From the avowal of Prussian officers themselves, there was not one single victim, among their men at the barracks of St. Martin, Louvain, where it was claimed that the first shot had been fired from a house situated in front of the Caserne. This would appear to be impossible had the civilians fired upon them point blank from across the street. It was said that when certain houses near the barracks were burning, numerous explosions occurred, revealing the presence of cartridges; but these houses were drinking houses much frequented by German soldiers. It was said that Spanish students shot from the schools in the Rue de la Station, but Father Catala, rector of the school, affirms that the schools were empty. . . .  \"If it was necessary, for whatever reason, to do what was done at Vise, at Dinant, at Aerschot, at Louvain, and in a hundred other towns that were sacked, pillaged and burned, where masses were shot down because civilians had fired on German troops, and if it was necessary to do this on a scale never before witnessed in history, one might not unreasonably assume that the alleged firing by civilians was done on a scale, if not so thoroughly organized, at least somewhat in proportion to the rage of destruction that punished it. And hence it would seem to be a simple matter to produce at least convincing evidence that civilians had fired on the soldiers; but there is no testimony to that effect beyond that of the soldiers who merely assert it: Man hat geschossen. If there were no more firing on soldiers by civilians in Belgium than is proved by the German testimony, it was not enough to justify the burning of the smallest of the towns that was overtaken by that fate. And there is not a scintilla of evidence of organized bands of francs-tireurs, such as were found in the war of 1870.\"  Under date of September 12, 1917, Minister Whitlock, in a report to the State Department of the United States, made the following summary: \"As one studies the evidence at hand, one is struck at the outset by the fact so general that it must exclude the hypothesis of coincidence, and that is that these wholesale massacres followed immediately upon some check, some reverse, that the German army had sustained. The German army was checked by the guns of the forts to the east of Liege, and the horrors of Vise, Verviers, Bligny, Battice, Hervy and twenty villages follow. When they entered Liege, they burned the houses along two streets and killed many persons, five or six Spaniards among them. Checked before Namur they sacked Andenne, Bouvignies, and Champignon, and when they took Namur they burned one hundred and fifty houses. Compelled to give battle to the French army in the Belgian Ardennes they ravaged the beautiful valley of the Semois; the complete destruction of the village of Rossignlo and the extermination of its entire male population took place there. Checked again by the French on the Meuse, the awful carnage of Dinant results. Held on the Sambre by the French, they burn one hundred houses at Charleroi and enact the appalling tragedy of Tamines. At Mons, the English hold them, and after that all over the Borinage there is a systematic destruction, pillage and murder. The Belgian army drive them back from Malines and Louvain is doomed. The Belgian army failing back and fighting in retreat took refuge in the forts of Antwerp, and the burning and sack of Hougaerde, Wavre, Ottignies, Grimde, Neerlinter, Weert, St. George, Shaffen and Aerschot follow.

[Illustration: Photograph of King and soldiers parading on horses.]   Photo by Trans-Atlantic News Service   KING ALBERT AT THE HEAD OF THE HEROIC SOLDIERS OF BELGIUM   It is universally agreed that the Belgian monarch was no figurehead   general but a real leader of his troops. It was these men, facing   annihilation, who astonished the world by opposing the German military   machine successfully enough to allow France to get her armies into   shape and prevent the immediate taking of Paris that was planned by   Germany.  [Illustration: Painting of soldiers dragging large guns through mud; shells are exploding in the background; in the foreground a dead soldier lies face down in the mud.]   THE TERRIBLE FLANDERS MUD   A German battery endeavoring to escape from a British advance sinks in   the mud. The gunners are endeavoring to pull the gun out with ropes.   \"The Belgian troops inflicted serious losses on the Germans in the South of the Province of Limbourg, and the towns of Lummen, Bilsen, and Lanaeken are partially destroyed. Antwerp held out for two months, and all about its outer line of fortifications there was blood and fire, numerous villages were sacked and burned and the whole town of Termonde was destroyed. During the battles of September the village of Boortmeerbeek near Malines, occupied by the Germans, was retaken by the Belgians, and when the Germans entered it again they burned forty houses. Three times occupied by the Belgians and retaken by the Germans Boortmeerbeek was three times punished in the same way. That is to say, everywhere the German army met with a defeat it took it out, as we say in America, on the civil population. And that is the explanation of the German atrocities in Belgium.\"  A committee of the highest honor and responsibility was appointed by the British Government to investigate the whole subject of atrocities in Belgium and Northern France. Its chairman was the Rt. Hon. Viscount James Bryce, formerly British Ambassador to the United States. Its other members were the Rt. Hon. Sir Frederick Pollock, the Rt. Hon. Sir Edward Clark, Sir Alfred Hopkinson, Mr. H. A. L. Fisher, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sheffield, Mr. Harold Cox and Sir Kenelm E. Digby.  The report of the commission bears upon its face the stamp of painstaking search for truth, substantiates every statement made by Minister Whitlock and makes known many horrible instances of cruelty and barbarity. It makes the following deductions as having been proved beyond question:  1. That there were in many parts of Belgium deliberate and systematically organized massacres of the civil population, accompanied by many isolated murders and other outrages.  2. That in the conduct of the war generally innocent civilians, both men and women, were murdered in large numbers, women violated, and children murdered.  3. That looting, house burning, and the wanton destruction of property were ordered and countenanced by the officers of the German army, that elaborate provision had been made for systematic incendiarism at the very outbreak of the war, and that the burnings and destruction were frequent where no military necessity could be alleged, being, indeed, part of a system of general terrorization.  4. That the rules and usages of war were frequently broken, particularly by the using of civilians, including women and children, as a shield for advancing forces exposed to fire, to a less degree by killing the wounded and prisoners and in the frequent abuse of the Red Cross and the white flag.   The Bryce Commission\\'s report on the destruction of Dinant is an example of testimony laid before them. It follows:   \"A clear statement of the outrages at Dinant, which many travelers will recall as a singularly picturesque town on the Meuse, is given by one witness, who says that the Germans began burning houses in the Rue St. Jacques on the 21st of August, and that every house in the street was burned. On the following day an engagement took place between the French and the Germans, and the witness spent the whole day in the cellar of a bank with his wife and children. On the morning of the 23d, about 5 o\\'clock, firing ceased, and almost immediately afterward a party of Germans came to the house. They rang the bell and began to batter at the door and windows. The witness\\' wife went to the door and two or three Germans came in. The family were ordered out into the street. There they found another family, and the two families were driven with their hands above their heads along the Rue Grande. All the houses in the street were burning.  \"The party was eventually put into a forge where there were a number of other prisoners, about a hundred in all, and were kept there from 11 A. M. till 2 P. M. They were then taken to the prison. There they were assembled in a courtyard and searched. No arms were found. They were then passed through into the prison itself and put into cells. The witness and his wife were separated from each other. During the next hour the witness heard rifle shots continually and noticed in the corner of a courtyard leading off the row of cells the body of a young man with a mantle thrown over it. He recognized the mantle as having belonged to his wife. The witness\\' daughter was allowed to go out to see what had happened to her mother, and the witness himself was allowed to go across the courtyard half an hour afterward for the same purpose. He found his wife lying on the floor in a room. She had bullet wounds in four places but was alive and told her husband to return to the children and he did so.  \"About 5 o\\'clock in the evening, he saw the Germans bringing out all the young and middle-aged men from the cells, and ranging their prisoners, to the number of forty, in three rows in the middle of the courtyard. About twenty Germans were drawn up opposite, but before anything was done there was a tremendous fusillade from some point near the prison and the civilians were hurried back to their cells. Half an hour later the same forty men were brought back into the courtyard. Almost immediately there was a second fusillade and they were driven back to the cells again.  \"About 7 o\\'clock the witness and other prisoners were brought out of their cells and marched out of the prison. They went between two lines of troops to Roche Bayard, about a kilometer away. An hour later the women and children were separated and the prisoners were brought back to Dinant passing the prison on their way. Just outside the prison, the witness saw three lines of bodies which he recognized as being those of his neighbors. They were nearly all dead, but he noticed movement in some of them. There were about one hundred and twenty bodies. The prisoners were then taken up to the top of a hill outside Dinant and compelled to stay there till 8 o\\'clock in the morning. On the following day they were put into cattle trucks and taken thence to Coblenz. For three months they remained prisoners in Germany.  \"Unarmed civilians were killed in masses at other places near the prison. About ninety bodies were seen lying on the top of one another in a grass square opposite the convent. A witness asked a German officer why her husband had been shot, and he told her that it was because two of her sons had been in the civil guard and had shot at the Germans. As a matter of fact, one of her sons was at that time in Liege and the other in Brussels. It is stated that besides the ninety corpses referred to above, sixty corpses of civilians were recovered from a hole in the brewery yard and that forty-eight bodies of women and children were found in a garden. The town was systematically set on fire by hand grenades. Another witness saw a little girl of seven, one of whose legs was broken and the other injured by a bayonet. We have no reason to believe that the civilian population of Dinant gave any provocation, or that any other defense can be put forward to justify the treatment inflicted upon its citizens.\"   The Bryce Commission reports the outrages in a number of Belgian villages in this terse fashion:   \"In Hofstade a number of houses had been set on fire and many corpses were seen, some in houses, some in back yards, and some in the streets. Two witnesses speak of having seen the body of a young man pierced by bayonet thrusts with the wrists cut also. On a side road the corpse of a civilian was seen on his doorstep with a bayonet wound in his stomach and by his side the dead body of a boy of five or six with his hands nearly severed. The corpses of a woman and boy were seen at the blacksmith\\'s. They had been killed with the bayonet. In a cafe, a young man, also killed with the bayonet, was holding his hands together as if in the attitude of supplication.  \"In the garden of a house in the main street, bodies of two women were observed, and in another house, the body of a boy of sixteen with two bayonet wounds in the chest. In Sempst a similar condition of affairs existed. Houses were burning and in some of them were the charred remains of civilians. In a bicycle shop a witness saw the burned corpse of a man. Other witnesses speak of this incident. Another civilian, unarmed, was shot as he was running away. As will be remembered, all the arms had been given up some time before by the order of the burgomaster.  \"At Weerde four corpses of civilians were lying in the road. It was said that these men had fired upon the German soldiers; but this is denied. The arms had been given up long before. Two children were killed in the village of Weerde, quite wantonly as they were standing in the road with their mother. They were three or four years old and were killed with the bayonet. A small barn burning close by formed a convenient means of getting rid of bodies. They were thrown into the flames from the bayonets. It is right to add that no commissioned officer was present at the time. At Eppeghem, on August 25th, a pregnant woman who had been wounded with a bayonet was discovered in the convent. She was dying. On the road six dead bodies of laborers were seen.  \"At Boortmeerbeek a German soldier was seen to fire three times at a little girl five years old. Having failed to hit her, he subsequently bayoneted her. He was killed with the butt end of a rifle by a Belgian soldier who had seen him commit this murder from a distance. At Herent the charred body of a civilian was found in a butcher\\'s shop, and in a handcart twenty yards away was the dead body of a laborer. Two eye witnesses relate that a German soldier shot a civilian and stabbed him with a bayonet as he lay. He then made one of these witnesses, a civilian prisoner, smell the blood on the bayonet. At Haecht the bodies of ten civilians were seen lying in a row by a brewery wall. In a laborer\\'s house, which had been broken up, the mutilated corpse of a woman of thirty to thirty-five was discovered.\"  Concerning the treatment of women and children in general, the report continues: \"The evidence shows that the German authorities, when carrying out a policy of systematic arson and plunder in selected districts, usually drew some distinction between the adult male population on the one hand and the women and children on the other. It was a frequent practice to set apart the adult males of the condemned district with a view to the execution of a suitable number--preferably of the younger and more vigorous--and to reserve the women and children for milder treatment. The depositions, however, present many instances of calculated cruelty, often going the length of murder, toward the women and children of the condemned area.  \"At Dinant sixty women and children were confined in the cellar of a convent from Sunday morning till the following Friday, August 28th, sleeping on the ground, for there were no beds, with nothing to drink during the whole period, and given no food until Wednesday, when somebody threw into the cellar two sticks of macaroni and a carrot for each prisoner. In other cases the women and children were marched for long distances along roads, as, for instance, the march of the women from Louvain to Tirlemont, August 28th, the laggards pricked on by the attendant Uhlans. A lady complains of having been brutally kicked by privates. Others were struck at with the butt end of rifles. At Louvain, at Liege, at Aerschot, at Malines, at Montigny, at Andenne, and elsewhere, there is evidence that the troops were not restrained from drunkenness, and drunken soldiers cannot be trusted to observe the rules or decencies of war, least of all when they are called upon to execute a preordained plan of arson and pillage. From the very first women were not safe. At Liege women and children were chased about the streets by soldiers.  \"Witnesses recount how a great crowd of men, women and children from Aerschot were marched to Louvain, and then suddenly exposed to a fire from a mitrailleuse and rifles. \\'We were all placed,\\' recounts a sufferer, \\'in Station Street, Louvain, and the German soldiers fired on us. I saw the corpses of some women in the street. I fell down, and a woman who had been shot fell on top of me.\\' Women and children suddenly turned out into the streets, and, compelled to witness the destruction of their homes by fire, provided a sad spectacle to such as were sober enough to see.  \"A humane German officer, witnessing the ruin of Aerschot, exclaimed in disgust: \\'I am a father myself, and I cannot bear this. It is not war but butchery.\\' Officers as well as men succumbed to the temptation of drink, with results which may be illustrated by an incident which occurred at Campenhout. In this village there was a certain well-to-do merchant (name given) who had a cellar of good champagne. On the afternoon of the 14th or 15th of August three German cavalry officers entered the house and demanded champagne. Having drunk ten bottles and invited five or six officers and three or four private soldiers to join them, they continued their carouse, and then called for the master and mistress of the house.  \"\\'Immediately my mistress came in,\\' says the valet de chambre, \\'one of the officers who was sitting on the floor got up, and, putting a revolver to my mistress\\' temple, shot her dead. The officer was obviously drunk. The other officers continued to drink and sing, and they did not pay any great attention to the killing of my mistress. The officer who shot my mistress then told my master to dig a grave and bury my mistress. My master and the officer went into the garden, the officer threatening my master with a pistol. My master was then forced to dig the grave and to bury my mistress in it. I cannot say for what reason they killed my mistress. The officer who did it was singing all the time.\\'  \"In the evidence before us there are cases tending to show that aggravated crimes against women were sometimes severely punished. One witness reports that a young girl who was being pursued by a drunken soldier at Louvain appealed to a German officer, and that the offender was then and there shot. Another describes how an officer of the Thirty-second Regiment of the Line was led out to execution for the violation of two young girls, but reprieved at the request or with the consent of the girls\\' mother. These instances are sufficient to show that the maltreatment of women was no part of the military scheme of the invaders, however much it may appear to have been the inevitable result of the system of terror deliberately adopted in certain regions. Indeed, so much is avowed. \\'I asked the commander why we had been spared,\\' says a lady in Louvain, who deposes to having suffered much brutal treatment during the sack. He said: \\'We will not hurt you any more. Stay in Louvain. All is finished.\\' It was Saturday, August 29th, and the reign of terror was over.  \"The Germans used men, women and children of Belgium as screens for advancing infantry, as is shown in the following: Outside Fort Fleron, near Liege, men and children were marched in front of the Germans to prevent the Belgian soldiers from firing. The progress of the Germans through Mons was marked by many incidents of this character. Thus, on August 22d, half a dozen Belgian colliers returning from work were marching in front of some German troops who were pursuing the English, and in the opinion of the witnesses, they must have been placed there intentionally. An English officer describes how he caused a barricade to be erected in a main thoroughfare leading out of Mons, when the Germans, in order to reach a crossroad in the rear, fetched civilians out of the houses on each side of the main road and compelled them to hold up white flags and act as cover.  \"Another British officer who saw this incident is convinced that the Germans were acting deliberately for the purpose of protecting themselves from the fire of the British troops. Apart from this protection, the Germans could not have advanced, as the street was straight and commanded by the British rifle fire at a range of 700 or 800 yards. Several British soldiers also speak of this incident, and their story is confirmed by a Flemish witness in a side street.\"  The French Government also appointed a commission, headed by M. Georges Payelle. This body made an investigation of outrages committed by German officers and soldiers in Northern France. Its report showed conditions that outstripped in horror the war tactics of savages. It makes the following accusations:  \"In Rebais, two English cavalrymen who were surprised and wounded in this commune were finished off with gunshots by the Germans when they were dismounted and when one of them had thrown up his hands, showing thus that he was unarmed.  \"In the department of the Marne, as everywhere else, the German troops gave themselves up to general pillage, which was carried out always under similar conditions and with the complicity of their leaders. The Communes of Heiltz-le-Maurupt, Suippes, Marfaux, Fromentieres and Esternay suffered especially in this way. Everything which the invader could carry off from the houses was placed on motor lorries and vehicles. At Suippes, in particular, they carried off in this way a quantity of different objects, among these sewing machines and toys. A great many villages, as well as important country towns, were burned without any reason whatever. Without doubt, these crimes were committed by order, as German detachments arrived in the neighborhood with their torches, their grenades, and their usual outfit for arson.  \"At Marfaux nineteen private houses were burned. Of the Commune of Glannes practically nothing remains. At Somme-Tourbe the entire village has been destroyed, with the exception of the Mairie, the church and two private buildings. At Auve nearly the whole town has been destroyed. At Etrepy sixty-three families out of seventy are homeless. At Huiron all of the houses, with the exception of five have been burned. At Sermaize-les-Bains only about forty houses out of 900 remain. At Bignicourt-sur-Saultz thirty houses out of thirty-three are in ruins.  \"At Suippes, the big market town which has been practically burned out, German soldiers carrying straw and cans of petrol have been seen in the streets. While the mayor\\'s house was burning, six sentinels with fixed bayonets were under orders to forbid anyone to approach and to prevent any help being given.  \"All this destruction by arson, which only represents a small proportion of the acts of the same kind in the Department of Seine-et-Marne, was accomplished without the least tendency to rebellion or the smallest act of resistance being recorded against the inhabitants of the localities which are today more or less completely destroyed. In some villages the Germans, before setting fire to them made one of their soldiers fire a shot from his rifle so as to be able to pretend afterward that the civilian population had attacked them, an allegation which is all the more absurd since at the time when the enemy arrived, the only inhabitants left were old men, sick persons, or people absolutely without any means of aggression.   [Illustration: Painting]   THE HORRORS OF GERMAN RULE IN FRANCE   Forcibly removing French civilians from Lille to German labor   colonies. Families were ruthlessly separated and led away into slavery   often worse than death.   [Illustration: Hand to hand combat with bayonets.]   Copyright Underwood and Underwood, N. Y.   A FIGHT IN A CLOUD OF GAS   The Germans had sent over gas and in this spot it lingered. Then the   infantry advanced and here, amid the British wire entanglements, the   foes meet. Both sides in gas masks, they struggle amid the \"poisonous   vapor, and when the bayonet fails they fight, like the pair in the   foreground, to bring death by tearing away their opponent\\'s mask.   \"Numerous crimes against the person have also been committed. In the majority of the communes hostages have been taken away; many of them have not returned. At Sermaize-les-Bains, the Germans carried off about one hundred and fifty people, some of whom were decked out with helmets and coats and compelled, thus equipped, to mount guard over the bridges.  \"At Bignicourt-sur-Saultz thirty men and forty-five women and children were obliged to leave with a detachment. One of the men--a certain Emile Pierre--has not returned nor sent any news of himself. At Corfelix, M. Jacqet, who was carried off on the 7th of September with eleven of his fellow-citizens, was found five hundred meters from the village with a bullet in his head.  \"At Champuis, the cure, his maid-servant, and four other inhabitants who were taken away on the same day as the hostages of Corfelix had not returned at the time of our visit to the place.  \"At the same place an old man of seventy, named Jacquemin, was tied down in his bed by an officer and left in this state without food for three days. He died a little time after. At Vert-la-Gravelle a farm hand was killed. He was struck on the head with a bottle and his chest was run through with a lance. The garde champetre Brulefer of le Gault-la-Foret was murdered at Maclaunay, where he had been taken by the Germans. His body was found with his head shattered and a wound on his chest.  \"At Champguyon, a commune which has been fired, a certain Verdier was killed in his father-in-law\\'s house. The latter was not present at the execution, but he heard a shot and next day an officer said to him, \\'Son shot. He is under the ruins.\\' In spite of the search made the body has not been found among them. It must have been consumed in the fire.  \"At Sermaize, the roadmaker, Brocard, was placed among a number of hostages. Just at the moment when he was being arrested with his son, his wife and his daughter-in-law in a state of panic rushed to throw themselves into the Saulx. The old man was able to free himself for a moment and ran in all haste after them and made several attempts to save them, but the Germans dragged him away pitilessly, leaving the two wretched women struggling in the river. When Brocard and his son were restored to liberty, four days afterward, and found the bodies, they discovered that their wives had both received bullet wounds in the head.  \"At Triaucourt the Germans gave themselves up to the worst excesses. Angered doubtless by the remark which an officer had addressed to a soldier, against whom a young girl of nineteen, Mlle. Helene Proces, had made complaint of on account of the indecent treatment to which she had been subjected, they burned the village and made a systematic massacre of the inhabitants. They began by setting fire to the house of an inoffensive householder, M. Jules Gand, and by shooting this unfortunate man as he was leaving his house to escape the flames. Then they dispersed among the houses in the streets, firing off their rifles on every side. A young man, seventeen years, Georges Lecourtier, who tried to escape, was shot. M. Alfred Lallemand suffered the same fate. He was pursued into the kitchen of his fellow-citizen Tautelier, and murdered there, while Tautelier received three bullets in his hand.  \"Fearing, not without reason, for their lives, Mlle. Proces, her mother and her grandmother of seventy-one and her old aunt of eighty-one, tried to cross the trellis which separates their garden from a neighboring property with the help of a ladder. The young girl alone was able to reach the other side and to avoid death by hiding in the cabbages. As for the other women, they were struck down by rifle shots. The village cure collected the brains of the aunt on the ground on which they were strewn and had the bodies carried into Proces\\' house. During the following night, the Germans played the piano near the bodies.  \"While the carnage raged, the fire rapidly spread and devoured thirty-five houses. An old man of seventy and a child of two months perished in the flames. M. Igier, who was trying to save his cattle, was pursued for 300 meters by soldiers, who fired at him ceaselessly. By a miracle this man had the good fortune not to be wounded, but five bullets went through his clothing.\"  This summary merely hints at the atrocities that were perpetrated. And these are the crimes that France and Belgium will remember after indemnities have been paid, after borders have been re-established and after generations shall have past. The horrors of blazing villages, of violated womanhood, of mutilated childhood, of stark and senseless butcheries, will flash before the minds of French and Belgian men and women when Germany\\'s name shall be mentioned long after the declaration of peace.  Schrecklichkeit had its day. It took its bloody toll of the fairest and bravest of two gallant nations. It ravaged Poland as well and wreaked its fiendish will on wounded soldiers on the battle-fields.  But Schrecklichkeit is dead. Belgium and France have shown that murder and rape and arson can not destroy liberty nor check the indomitable ambitions of the free peoples of earth.  The lesson to Germany was taught at a terrible cost to humanity, but it was taught in a fashion that nations hereafter who shall dream of emulating the Hun will know in advance that frightfulness serves no end except to feed the lust for destruction that exists only in the most debased and brutish of men.    CHAPTER VII  THE FIRST BATTLE OF THE MARNE  France and civilization were saved by Joffre and Foch at the first battle of the Marne, in September, 1914. Autocracy was destroyed by Foch at the second battle of the Marne, in July, 1918.  This in a nutshell embraces the dramatic opening and closing episodes of the World War on the soil of France. Bracketed between these two glorious victories were the agonies of martyred France, the deaths and life-long cripplings of millions of men, the up-rooting of arrogant militarism, the liberation of captive nations.  The first battle of the Marne was wholly a French operation. The British were close at hand, but had no share in the victory. Generals Gallieni and Manoury, acting under instructions from Marshal Joffre, were driven by automobile to the headquarters of the British commander, Sir John French, in the village of Melun. They explained in detail General Joffre\\'s plan of attack upon the advancing German army. An urgent request was made that the British army halt its retreat, face about, and attack the two corps of von Kluck\\'s army then confronting the British. Simultaneously with this attack General Manoury\\'s forces were to fall upon the flank and the rear guard of von Kluck along the River Ourcq. This operation was planned for the next day, September 5th. Sir John French replied that he could not get his tired army in readiness for battle within forty-eight hours. This would delay the British attack in all probability until September 7th.  Joffre\\'s plan of battle, however, would admit of no delay. The case was urgent; there was grave danger of a union between the great forces headed by the Crown Prince and those under von Kluck. He resolved to go ahead without the British, and ordered Manoury to strike as had been planned.  He fixed as an extreme limit for the movement of retreat, which was still going on, the line of Bray-sur-Seine, Nogent-sur-Seine, Arcis-sur-Aube, Vitry-le-Francois, and the region to the north of Bar-le-Duc. This line might be reached if the troops were compelled to go back so far. They would attack before reaching it, as soon as there was a possibility of bringing about an offensive disposition, permitting the co-operation of the whole of the French forces. On September 5 it appeared that this desired situation existed.   [Illustration: Photograph]   Copyright Underwood and Underwood, N.Y.

[Illustration: Photograph]   MARSHAL FERDINAND FOCH, GENERALISSIMO OF THE ALLIED ARMIES   No leader could command greater confidence than the brilliant   strategist to whom was mainly due the great victory of the Marne in   the first autumn of the war. He also directed the French offensive on   the Somme in 1916 and in November, 1917, he was chosen as the French   representative and subsequently chairman of the Central Military   Committee appointed to assist the Supreme Allied War Council. Marshal   Foch was formerly for five years lecturer on strategy and tactics at   the Ecole de Guerre. At the close of the war he said to the Allied   armies: \"You have won the greatest battle in history and saved the   most sacred cause--the liberty of the world,\"   [Illustration: Map; Paris in the lower left corner, showing various battle lines Eastward to Luxumburg.]   THE FIRST GERMAN DASH FOR PARIS   The First German army, carrying audacity to temerity, had continued its endeavor to envelop the French left, had crossed the Grand Morin, and reached the region of Chauffry, to the south of Rebais and of Esternay. It aimed then at cutting Joffre off from Paris, in order to begin the investment of the capital.  The Second army had its head on the line Champaubert, Etoges, Bergeres, and Vertus.  The Third and Fourth armies reached to Chalons-sur-Marne and Bussy-le-Repos. The Fifth army was advancing on one side and the other from the Argonne as far as Triacourt-les-Islettes and Juivecourt. The Sixth and Seventh armies were attacking more to the east.  The French left army had been able to occupy the line Sezanne, Villers-St. Georges and Courchamps. This was precisely the disposition which the General-in-Chief had wished to see achieved. On the 4th he decided to take advantage of it, and ordered all the armies to hold themselves ready. He had taken from his right two new army corps, two divisions of infantry, and two divisions of cavalry, which were distributed between his left and his center.  On the evening of the 5th he addressed to all the commanders of armies a message ordering them to attack.  \"The hour has come,\" he wrote, \"to advance at all costs, and to die where you stand rather than give way.\"  If one examines the map, it will be seen that by his inflection toward Meaux and Coulommiers General von Kluck was exposing his right to the offensive action of the French left. This is the starting point of the victory of the Marne.  On the evening of September 5th the French left army had reached the front Penchard-Saint-Souflet-Ver. On the 6th and 7th it continued its attacks vigorously with the Ourcq as objective. On the evening of the 7th it was some kilometers from the Ourcq, on the front Chambry-Marcilly-Lisieux-Acy-en-Multien. On the 8th, the Germans, who had in great haste reinforced their right by bringing their Second and Fourth army corps back to the north, obtained some successes by attacks of extreme violence. But in spite of this pressure the French held their ground. In a brilliant action they took three standards, and being reinforced prepared a new attack for the 10th. At the moment that this attack was about to begin the enemy was already in retreat toward the north. The attack became a pursuit, and on the 12th the French established themselves on the Aisne.  Why did the German forces which were confronting the French, and on the evening before attacking so furiously, retreat on the morning of the 10th? Because in bringing back on the 6th several army corps from the south to the north to face the French left, the enemy had exposed his left to the attacks of the now rested British, who had immediately faced around toward the north, and to those of the French armies which were prolonging the English lines to the right. This is what the French command had sought to bring about. This is what happened on September 8th and allowed the development and rehabilitation which it was to effect.  On the 6th the British army set out from the line Rozcy-Lagny and that evening reached the southward bank of the Grand Morin. On the 7th and 8th it continued its march, and on the 9th had debouched to the north of the Marne below Chauteau-Thierry--the town that was to become famous for the American stand in 1918--taking in flank the German forces which on that day were opposing, on the Ourcq, the French left army. Then it was that these forces began to retreat, while the British army, going in pursuit and capturing seven guns and many prisoners, reached the Aisne between Soissons and Longueval.  The role of the French army, which was operating to the right of the British army, was threefold. It had to support the British attacking on its left. It had on its right to support the center, which, from September 7th, had been subjected to a German attack of great violence. Finally, its mission was to throw back the three active army corps and the reserve corps which faced it.  On the 7th, it made a leap forward, and on the following days reached and crossed the Marne, seizing, after desperate fighting, guns, howitzers, mitrailleuses, and a million cartridges. On the 12th it established itself on the north edge of the Montagne-de-Reime in contact with the French center, which for its part had just forced the enemy to retreat in haste.  The French center consisted of a new army created on August 29th and of one of those which at the beginning of the campaign had been engaged in Belgian Luxemburg. The first had retreated, on August 29th to September 5th, from the Aisne to the north of the Marne and occupied the general front Sezanne-Mailly.  The second, more to the east, had drawn back to the south of the line Humbauville-Chateau-Beauchamp-Bignicourt-Blesmes-Maurupt-le-Montoy.  The enemy, in view of his right being arrested and the defeat of his enveloping movement, made a desperate effort from the 7th to the 19th to pierce the French center to the west and to the east of Fere-Champenoise. On the 8th he succeeded in forcing back the right of the new French army, which retired as far as Gouragancon. On the 9th, at 6 o\\'clock in the morning, there was a further retreat to the south of that village, while on the left the other army corps also had to go back to the line Allemant-Connantre.  Despite this retreat General Foch, commanding the army of the center, ordered a general offensive for the same day. With the Morocco division, whose behavior was heroic, he met a furious assault of the Germans on his left toward the marshes of Saint Gond. Then, with the divisions which had just victoriously overcome the attacks of the enemy to the north of Sezanne, and with the whole of his left army corps, he made a flanking attack in the evening of the 9th upon the German forces, and notably the guard, which had thrown back his right army corps. The enemy, taken by surprise by this bold maneuver, did not resist, and beat a hasty retreat. This marked Foch as the most daring and brilliant strategist of the war.  On the 11th the French crossed the Marne between Tours-sur-Marne and Sarry, driving the Germans in front of them in disorder. On the 12th they were in contact with the enemy to the north of the Camp de Chalons. The reserve army of the center, acting on the right of the one just referred to, had been intrusted with the mission during the 7th, 8th, and 9th of disengaging its neighbor, and it was only on the 10th that being reinforced by an army corps from the east, it was able to make its action effectively felt. On the 11th the Germans retired. But, perceiving their danger, they fought desperately, with enormous expenditure of projectiles, behind strong intrenchments. On the 12th the result had none the less been attained, and the two French center armies were solidly established on the ground gained.  To the right of these two armies were three others. They had orders to cover themselves to the north and to debouch toward the west on the flank of the enemy, which was operating to the west of the Argonne. But a wide interval in which the Germans were in force separated them from the French center. The attack took place, nevertheless, with very brilliant success for the French artillery, which destroyed eleven batteries of the Sixteenth German army corps.  On the 10th inst., the Eighth and Fifteenth German army corps counter-attacked, but were repulsed. On the 11th French progress continued with new successes, and on the 12th the French were able to face round toward the north in expectation of the near and inevitable retreat of the enemy, which, in fact, took place from the 13th.  The withdrawal of the mass of the German force involved also that of the left. From the 12th onward the forces of the enemy operating between Nancy and the Vosges retreated in a hurry before the two French armies of the East, which immediately occupied the positions that the enemy had evacuated. The offensive of the French right had thus prepared and consolidated in the most useful way the result secured by the left and center.  Such was this seven days\\' battle, in which more than two millions of men were engaged. Each army gained ground step by step, opening the road to its neighbor, supported at once by it, taking in flank the adversary which the day before it had attacked in front, the efforts of one articulating closely with those of the other, a perfect unity of intention and method animating the supreme command.  To give this victory all its meaning it is necessary to add that it was gained by troops which for two weeks had been retreating, and which, when the order for the offensive was given, were found to be as ardent as on the first day. It has also to be said that these troops had to meet the whole Germany army. Under their pressure the German retreat at certain times had the appearance of a rout.  In spite of the fatigue of the poilus, in spite of the power of the German heavy artillery, the French took colors, guns, mitrailleuses, shells, and thousands of prisoners. One German corps lost almost the whole of its artillery.  In that great battle the spectacular rush of General Gallieni\\'s army defending Paris, was one of the dramatic surprises that decided the issue. In that stroke Gallieni sent his entire force forty miles to attack the right wing of the German army. In this gigantic maneuver every motor car in Paris was utilized, and the flying force of Gallieni became the \"Army in Taxicabs,\" a name that will live as long as France exists.  General Clergerie, Chief of Staff to Gallieni told the story for posterity. He said:  \"From August 26, 1914, the German armies had been descending upon Paris by forced marches. On September 1st they were only three days\\' march from the advanced line of the intrenched camp, which the garrison were laboring desperately to put into condition for defense. It was necessary to cover with trenches a circuit of 110 miles, install siege guns, assure the coming of supplies for them over narrow-gauge railways, assemble the food and provisions of all kinds necessary for a city of 4,000,000 inhabitants.  \"But on September 3d, the intelligence service, which was working perfectly, stated, about the middle of the day, that the German columns, after heading straight for Paris, were swerving toward the southeast and seemed to wish to avoid the fortified camp.  \"General Gallieni and I then had one of those long conferences which denoted grave events; they usually lasted from two to five minutes at most. The fact is that the military government of Paris did little talking--it acted. The conference reached this conclusion: \\'If they do not come to us, we will go to them with all the force we can muster.\\' Nothing remained but to make the necessary preparations. The first thing to do was not to give the alarm to the enemy. General Manoury\\'s army immediately received orders to lie low and avoid any engagement that was not absolutely necessary.\" Then care was taken to reinforce it by every means. All was ready at the designated time.  In the night of September 3d, knowing that the enemy would have to leave only a rear guard on one bank of the Ourcq, General Gallieni and General Clergerie decided to march against that rear guard, to drive it back with all the weight of the Manoury army, to cut the enemy\\'s communications, and take full advantage of his hazardous situation. Immediately the following order was addressed to General Manoury:   Because of the movement of the German armies, which seem to be slipping in before our front to the southeast, I intend to send your army to attack them in the flank, that is to say, in an easterly direction. I will indicate your line of march as soon as I learn that of the British army. But make your arrangements now so that your troops shall be ready to march this afternoon and to begin a general movement east of the intrenched camp tomorrow.   At ten in the morning a consultation was held by Generals Gallieni, Clergerie, and Manoury, and the details of the plan of operations were immediately decided. General Joffre gave permission to attack and announced that he would himself take the offensive on the 6th. On the 5th, at noon, the army from Paris fired the first shot; the battle of the Ourcq, a preface to the Marne, had begun.  General Clergerie then told what a precious purveyor of information he had found in General von der Marwitz, cavalry commander of the German first army, who made intemperate use of the wireless telegraph and did not even take the trouble to put into cipher his dispatches, of which the Eiffel Tower made a careful collection. \"In the evening of September 9th,\" he said, \"an officer of the intelligence corps brought me a dispatch from this same Marwitz couched in something like these terms: \\'Tell me exactly where you are and what you are doing. Hurry up, because XXX.\\' The officer was greatly embarrassed to interpret those three X\\'s. Adopting the language of the poilu, I said to him, \\'Translate it, \"I am going to bolt.\"\\' True enough, next day we found on the site of the German batteries, which had been precipitately evacuated, stacks of munitions; while by the roadside we came upon motors abandoned for the slightest breakdown, and near Betz almost the entire outfit of a field bakery, with a great store of flour and dough half-kneaded. Paris and France were saved.  \"Von Kluck could not get over his astonishment. He has tried to explain it by saying he was unlucky, for out of a hundred governors not one would have acted as Gallieni did, throwing his whole available force nearly forty miles from his stronghold. It was downright imprudence.\"    CHAPTER VIII  JAPAN IN THE WAR  On August 15, 1914, the Empire of Japan issued an ultimatum to Germany. She demanded the evacuation of Tsing-tau, the disarming of the warships there and the handing over of the territory to Japan for ultimate reversion to China. The time limit for her reply was set at 12 o\\'clock, August 24th. To this ultimatum Germany made no reply, and at 2.30 P. M., August 23d, the German Ambassador was handed his passports and war was declared.  The reason for the action of Japan was simple. She was bound by treaty to Great Britain to come to her aid in any war in which Great Britain might be involved. On August 4th a note was received from Great Britain requesting Japan to safeguard British shipping in the Far East. Japan replied that she could not guarantee the safety of British shipping so long as Germany was in occupation of the Chinese province of Tsing-tau. She suggested in turn that England agree to allow her to remove this German menace. The British Government agreed, on the condition that Tsing-tau be subsequently returned to China.  The Japanese Government in taking this stand was acting with courage and with loyalty. Toward individual Germans she entertained no animosity. She had the highest respect for German scholarship and German military science. She had been sending her young men to German seats of learning, and had based the reorganization of her army upon the German military system. But she did not believe that a treaty was a mere \"scrap of paper,\" and was determined to fulfill her obligations in the treaty with England.  It seems to have been the opinion of the highest Japanese military authorities that Germany would win the war. Japan\\'s statesmen, however, believed that Germany was a menace to both China and Japan and had lively recollections of her unfriendly attitude in connection with the Chino-Japanese war and in the period that followed. Germany had been playing the same game in China that she had played in the Mediterranean and which had ultimately brought about the war.  The Chino-Japanese war had been a great Japanese triumph. One of Japan\\'s greatest victories had been the capture of Port Arthur, but the joy caused in Japan had not ended before it was turned into mourning because of German interference. Germany had then compelled Japan to quit Port Arthur, and to hand over that great fort to Russia so that she herself might take Kiao-chau without Russia\\'s objection.  Japan had never forgotten or forgiven. The German seizure of Kiao-chau had led to the Russian occupation of Port Arthur, the British occupation of Wei-hai-wei and French occupation of Kwan-chow Bay. The vultures were swooping down on defenseless China. This had led to the Boxer disturbance of 1910, where again the Kaiser had interfered.  Japan, who recognized that her interests and safety were closely allied with the preservation of the territorial integrity of China, had proposed to the powers that she be permitted to send her troops to the rescue of the beleaguered foreigners, but this proposition was refused on account of German suspicion of Japan\\'s motives. Later on, during the Russo-Japanese war, Russia was assisted in many ways by the German Government.  Furthermore, the popular sympathy with the Japanese was strongly with the Allies. It was the Kaiser who started the cry of the \"yellow peril,\" which had deeply hurt Japanese pride. Yet, even with this strong feeling, it was remarkable that Japan was willing to ally herself with Russia. She knew very well that after all the greatest danger to her liberties lay across the Japan Sea. Russian autocracy, with its militarism, its religious intolerance, its discriminating policy against foreign interests in commerce and trade, was the natural opponent of liberal Japan.  The immediate object of Japan in joining hands with England was to destroy the German menace in the Pacific. Before she delivered her ultimatum the Germans had been active; ignoring the rights of Japan while she was still neutral they had captured a Russian steamer within Japanese jurisdiction, as well as a number of British merchant vessels, and even a few Japanese ships had been intercepted by German cruisers. This was the disturbance to general peace in the Far East, which had prompted England to request Japan\\'s assistance.  Japan, when she entered the war, was at least twice as strong as when she began the war with Russia. She had an army of one million men, and a navy double the size of that which she had possessed when the Treaty of Portsmouth was signed. As soon as war was declared she proceeded to act. A portion of her fleet was directed against the German forces in the Pacific, one squadron occupying Jaluit, the seat of government of the Marshall Islands, on October 3d, but her main forces were directed against the fortress of Tsing-tau.  The Germans had taken great pride in Tsing-tau, and had made every effort to make it a model colony as well as an impregnable fortress. They had built costly water works, fine streets and fine public buildings. They had been making great preparations for a state of siege, although it was not expected that they would be able to hold out for a long time. There were hardly more than five thousand soldiers in the fortress, and in the harbor but four small gunboats and an Austrian cruiser, the Kaiserin Elizabeth. As Austria was not at war with Japan the authorization of Japan was asked for the removal of the Kaiserin Elizabeth to Shanghai, where she could be interned. The Japanese were favorable to this proposition, but at the last moment instructions arrived from Vienna directing the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador to ask for his passports at Tokio and the commander of the Kaiserin Elizabeth to assist the Germans in the defense of Tsing-tau. The Germans also received orders to defend their fortress to the very last. A portion of the German squadron, under Admiral von Spee, had sailed away before the Japanese attack, one of these being the famous commerce raider, the Emden.  On the 27th of August the Japanese made their first move by taking possession of some of the small islands at the mouth of the harbor of Kiao-chau. From these points as bases they swept the surrounding waters for mines, with such success that during the whole siege but one vessel of their fleet was injured by a mine. On the 2d of September they landed troops at the northern base of the peninsula upon which Tsing-tau was situated, with the object of cutting off the fortress from the mainland.  The heavy rains which were customary at that season prevented much action, but airplanes were sent which dropped bombs upon the wireless station, electric power station and railway station of Kiao-chau, and upon the ships in the harbor. On September 13th General Kamio captured the railway station of Kiao-chau which stands at the head of the bay. This placed him twenty-two miles from Tsing-tau itself. On September 27th he captured Prince Heinrich Hill giving him a gun position from which he could attack the inner forts. On the 23d a small British force arrived from Wei-hai-wei to co-operate with the Japanese.   [Illustration: Map of the city Tsing-Tau and Kiao-Chau Bay.]   THE GERMAN GIBRALTAR IN THE FAR EAST WHICH FELL TO THE JAPANESE   The combined forces then advanced until they were only five miles from Tsing-tau. The German warships were bombarding the Japanese troops fiercely, and were being replied to by the Japanese squadron in the mouth of the harbor. The great waste of German ammunition led General Kamio to the opinion that the Germans did not contemplate a long siege. He then determined on a vigorous assault.  Before the attack was made he gave the non-combatants an opportunity of leaving, and on the 15th of October a number of women and children and Chinese were allowed to pass through the Japanese lines. On October 31st the bombardment began, and the German forts were gradually silenced. On November 2d the Kaiserin Elizabeth was sunk in the harbor.  The Allied armies were pushing their way steadily down, until, on November 6th, their trenches were along the edge of the last German redoubts. At 6 o\\'clock on that day white flags were floating over the central forts and by 7.30 Admiral Waldeck, the German Governor, had signed the terms of capitulation.  Germany\\'s prize colony on the continent of Asia had disappeared. The survivors, numbering about three thousand, were sent to Japan as prisoners of war. Japanese losses were but two hundred and thirty-six men killed. They had, however, lost one third-class cruiser, the Takachiho, and several smaller crafts. The whole expedition was a notable success. It had occupied much less time than either Japan or Germany had expected, and the news was received in Germany with a universal feeling of bitterness and chagrin.  After the Japanese capture of Kiao-chau Japan\\'s assistance to the Allies, while not spectacular, was extremely important, and its importance increased during the last two years of the war. Her cruiser squadrons did continuous patrol duty in the Pacific and in the China Sea and even in the Indian Ocean. She occupied three groups of German Islands in the South Sea, assisted in driving German raiders from the Pacific, and by her efficiency permitted a withdrawal of British warships to points where they could be useful nearer home. She patrolled the Pacific coast of North and South America, landed marines to quell riots at Singapore, and finally entered into active service in European waters by sending a destroyer squadron to the assistance of the Allies in the Mediterranean.  But while the aid of Japan\\'s navy was important to the Allies, her greatest assistance to the Allied cause was what she did in supplying Russia with military supplies. The tremendous struggle carried on by Russia\\'s forces during the first years prevented an easy German victory, and was only made possible through the assistance of Japan. Enormous quantities of guns, ammunition, military stores, hospital and Red Cross supplies, were sent into Russia, with skilled officers and experts to accompany them.  In the last year of the war Japan once more came prominently in the public eye in connection with the effort made by the Allies to protect from the Russian Bolsheviki vast stores of ammunition which had been landed in ports of Eastern Siberia. She was compelled to land troops to do this and to preserve order in localities where her citizens were in danger. Upon the development of the Czecho-Slovak movement in Eastern Siberia a Japanese force, in association with troops from the United States and Great Britain, was landed to protect the Czecho-Slovaks from Bolsheviki treachery. These troops succeeded in their object, and throughout the latter period of the war kept Eastern Siberia friendly to the Allied cause. In this campaign there was but little blood shed. The expedition was followed by the strong sympathy of the allied world which was full of admiration for the loyalty and courage of the Czecho-Slovaks and their heroic leaders.    CHAPTER IX  CAMPAIGN IN THE EAST  Long before the declaration of war the German military experts had made their plans. They recognized that in case of war with Russia, France would come to the rescue of its ally. They hoped that Italy, and felt sure that England, would remain neutral, but, no doubt, had provided for the possibility that these two nations would join the ranks of their foes. They recognized that they would be compelled to fight against greatly superior numbers, but they had this advantage, that they were prepared to move at once, while England was unprepared, and Russia, with enormous numbers, was so unprovided with railroad facilities that it would take weeks before her armies would be dangerous.  Their plan of campaign, then, was obvious. Leaving in the east only such forces as were necessary for a strong defense, they would throw the bulk of their strength against the French. They anticipated an easy march to Paris, and then with France at their mercy they would gather together all their powers and deal with Russia. But they had underestimated both the French power of resistance, and the Russian weakness, and in particular they had not counted upon the check that they were to meet with in gallant Belgium.  The Russian mobilization was quicker by far than had been anticipated. Her armies were soon engaged with the comparatively small German forces, and met with great success.  To understand the Russian campaign one must have some knowledge of the geography of western Russia. Russian Poland projects as a great quadrilateral into eastern Germany. It is bounded on the north by East Prussia, on the south by Galicia, and the western part reaches deep into Germany itself. The land is a broad, level plain, through which from south to north runs the River Vistula. In the center lies the capital, Warsaw, protected by a group of fortresses. The Russian army, therefore, could not make a direct western advance until it had protected its flanks by the conquest of East Prussia on the north, and Galicia on the south.  By the beginning of the third week in August the first Russian armies were ready. Her forces were arranged as follows: Facing East Prussia was the Army of the Niemen, four corps strong; the Army of Poland, consisting of fifteen army corps, occupied a wide front from Narev on the north to the Bug Valley; a third army, the Army of Galicia, directed its line of advance southward into the country between Lemberg and the River Sareth. The fortresses protecting Warsaw, still further to the east, were well garrisoned, and in front of them to the west were troops intended to delay any German advance from Posen. The Russian commander-in-chief was the Grand Duke Nicholas, uncle of the late Czar, and one of the most admirable representatives of the Russian at his best; a splendid soldier, honest, straightforward, and patriotic, he was the idol of his men. He had with him a brilliant staff, but the strength of his army lay in its experience. They had learned war in the bitter school of the Manchurian campaign.  The German force on the frontier was not less than five hundred thousand men, and they were arranged for defense. Austria, in Galicia, had gathered nearly one million men under the auspices of Frederick. The first movement of these armies took place in East Prussia. The Army of the Niemen had completed its mobilization early in August, and was under the command of General Rennenkampf, one of the Russian leaders in Manchuria. In command of the German forces was General von Francois, an officer of Huguenot descent.  The first clash of these armies took place on the German frontier near Libau, on August 3d. Two days later, the Russians crossed the frontier, drove in the German advance posts, and seized the railway which runs south and east of the Masurian Lakes. The German force fell back, burning villages and destroying roads, according to their usual plan. On the 7th of August the main army of Rennenkampf crossed the border at Suwalki, advancing in two main bodies: the Army of the Niemen moving north from Suwalki, the Army of the Narev marching through the region of the Masurian Lakes. In the lake district they advanced toward Boyen, and then directed their march toward Insterburg.  To protect Insterburg, General van Francois made his first stand at Gumbinnen, where, on the 16th of August, the first important battle of this campaign took place. The result was the defeat and retirement of the Germans, and von Francois was forced to fall back on Koenigsberg.  Meantime, the Army of the Narev, under General Samsonov, was advancing through the country west of the Masurian Lakes. On the 20th his vanguard came upon a German army corps, strongly entrenched at the northwest end of the lakes. The Germans were defeated, and fled in great disorder toward Koenigsberg, abandoning their guns and wagons. Many prisoners were taken, and the Russians found themselves masters of all of East Prussia except that inside the Koenigsberg line. They then marched on Koenigsberg, and East Prussia was for a moment at the mercy of the conqueror.  Troops were left to invest Koenigsberg, and East Prussia was overrun with the enemy. The report as to the behavior of these troops met with great indignation in Germany; but better information insists that they behaved with decorum and discretion. The peasantry of East Prussia, remembering wild tales of the Cossacks of a hundred years before, fled in confusion with stories of burning and slaughter and outrage.  Germany became aroused. To thoroughly understand the effect of the Russian invasion of East Prussia, one must know something of the relations of that district with the German Empire. Historically, this was the cradle of the Prussian aristocracy, whose dangerous policies had alarmed Europe for so many decades. The Prussian aristocracy originated in a mixture of certain west German and Christian knights, with a pagan population of the eastern Baltic plain. The district was separate from Poland and never fell under the Polish influence. It was held by the Teutonic knights who conquered it in a sort of savage independence. The Christian faith, which the Teutonic knights professed to inculcate, took little root, but such civilization as Germany itself had absorbed did filter in. The chief noble of Borussia, the governing Duke, acquired in time the title of King, and it was here, not in Berlin, nor in Brandenburg, that the Hohenzollern power originated.   [Illustration: Painting]   THE FURY OF A COSSACK CHARGE   Some of the most bitter fighting of the war took place on the   snow-covered heights of the Carpathians when Russia\\'s armies struggled   with the foe. Here is illustrated a charge by Cossacks on an Austrian   battery. There is nothing in warfare quite like the furious onslaught   of the little men of the steppes on their wiry ponies.   [Illustration: Painting]   HIDE AND SEEK IN THE BALTIC   A Zeppelin flying over a British submarine in the stormy sea.   [Illustration: Map bounded by Koenigsberg on the North, Warsaw on the East, Cracow on the South and Posen on the West.]   THE EASTERN FIGHTING ZONE   East Prussia, therefore, had a sentimental importance in the eyes of the Prussian nobility. The Prussian Royal House, in particular, had toward this country an especial regard. Moreover, it was regarded by the Germans as a whole as their rampart against the Slav, a proof of the German power to withstand the dreaded Russian. That this sacred soil should now be in the hands of a Cossack army was not to be borne. The Kaiser acted at once.  Large forces were detached from the west and sent to the aid of the eastern army. A new commander was appointed. He was General von Hindenburg, a veteran of the Franco-Prussian War who had been for some years retired. After his retirement he devoted his time to the study of East Prussia, especially the ground around the Masurian Lakes. He became more familiar with its roads, its fields, its marshes, its bogs than any of the peasants who spent their lives in the neighborhood of the lakes. Before his retirement, in the annual maneuvers, he had often rehearsed his defense against Russian invaders. Indeed report, perhaps unfounded, described his retirement to the displeasure of the Emperor William at being badly worsted in one of these mimic combats. He had prevented the country from being cleared and the swamps from being drained, arguing that they were worth more to Germany than a dozen fortresses. A man of rugged strength, his face suggesting power and tenacity, he was to become the idol of the German people.  His chance had come. His army consisted of remnants of the forces of von Francois and large reinforcements sent him from the west. In all, perhaps, he had with him 150,000 men, and he had behind him an admirable system of strategic railways.  The Russian High Command was full of confidence. Rennenkampf had advanced with the Army of the Niemen toward Koenigsberg, whose fall was reported from time to time, without foundation. Koenigsberg was in fact impregnable to armies no stronger than those under Rennenkampf\\'s command. Samsonov with the Army of the Narev, had pushed on to the northeastern point of the lakes, and defeated the German army corps at Frankenau. Misled by his success, he decided to continue his advance through the lake region toward Allenstein. He marched first toward Osterode, in the wilderness of forest, lake and marsh, between Allenstein and the Lower Vistula. His force numbered 200,000 men, but the swamps made it impossible to proceed in mass. His column had to be temporarily divided, nor was he well informed as to the strength of his enemy. On Wednesday, the 26th of August, his advance guards were everywhere driven in. As he pushed on he discovered the enemy in great numbers, and late in the day realized that he was facing a great army.  Von Hindenburg had taken a position astride the railway from Allenstein to Soldau, and all access to his front was barred by lakes and swamps. He was safe from frontal attack, and could reinforce each wing at pleasure. From his right ran the only two good roads in the region, and at his left was the Osterode railway. On the first day he stood on the defensive, while the Russians, confident of victory, attacked again and again. Some ground was won and prisoners captured, and the news of a second victory was sent to western Europe.  The battle continued, however, until the last day of August and is known as the battle of Tannenberg, from a village of that name near the marshes. Having worn down his enemy, von Hindenburg counter-attacked. His first movement was on his right. This not only deceived Samsonov and led him to reinforce his left, but also enabled von Hindenburg to seize the only good road that would give the Russian army a chance of retreat. Meanwhile the German general was hurrying masses of troops northeastward to outflank the Russian right. While the Russians were reinforcing one flank, he was concentrating every man he could upon the other. Then his left swept southward, driving in and enveloping the Russian right, and Samsonov was driven into a country full of swamps and almost without roads.  To thoroughly understand the plight of the Russian army one must have some idea of the character of the Masurian Lake district. It was probably molded by the work of ice in the past. Great glaciers, in their progress toward the sea, have ground out hundreds of hollows, where are found small pools and considerable lakes. From these glaciers have been dropped patches of clay which hold the waters in wide extents of marsh and bog. The country presents a monotonous picture of low, rounded swells and flats, interspersed with stunted pine and birch woods. The marshes and the lakes form a labyrinth, difficult to pass even to those familiar with the country. The Masurian region is a great trap for any commander who has not had unlimited acquaintance with the place. Causeways, filled with great care, and railroads permit an orderly advance, but in a confused retreat disaster at once threatens.  This was the ground that von Hindenburg knew so well. The Russians resisted desperately, but their position could not be held. Disaster awaited them. They found their guns sinking to the axle-trees in mire. Whole regiments were driven into the lakes and drowned. On the last day of battle, August 31st, Samsonov himself was killed, and his army completely destroyed. Fifty thousand prisoners were taken with hundreds of guns and quantities of supplies. Von Hindenburg had attained the triumph of which he had so long dreamed.  It was an immensely successful example of that enveloping movement characteristic of German warfare, a victory recalling the battle of Sedan, and it was upon a scale not inferior to that battle.  The news of this great triumph reached Berlin upon the anniversary of the battle of Sedan, and on the same day that the news came from the west that von Kluck had reached the gates of Paris and it had a profound effect upon the German mind. They had grown to believe that the Germans were a sort of superman; these wonderful successes confirmed them in this belief.  No longer did they talk of a mere defense in the east; an advance on Warsaw was demanded and von Hindenburg was acclaimed the greatest soldier of his day. The Emperor made him Field Marshal, and placed him in command of the Teutonic armies in the east.  But von Hindenburg was not satisfied. The remnant of the defeated army had fled toward Narev, and without losing a moment von Hindenburg set off in pursuit. Rennenkampf, all this time, strange to say, had made no move, and at the news of Samsonov\\'s disaster he abandoned the siege of Koenigsberg and retreated toward the Niemen. At Gumbinnen he fought a rear-guard action with the German left, but had made up his mind that the Niemen must be the Russian line of defense. Von Hindenburg, following, crossed the Russian frontier and in the wide forests near Augustovo there was much fighting.

German reports, however, described it as a victory only second in importance to Tannenberg. Von Hindenburg then occupied Suwalki. He apparently had become over confident, and hardly realized that Rennenkampf was continually being reinforced by the Russian mobilization.  The Russian High Command understood the situation very well. Their aim was to keep von Hindenburg busy on the Niemen, while their armies in the south were overwhelming the fleeing Austrians. Von Hindenburg was deceived, and continued his advance until he got into serious trouble. His movement had begun on September 7th; his army consisted of the four corps with which he had won Tannenberg, and large reinforcements from Germany, including at least one guards battalion, and a number of Saxons and Bavarians. The country is one vast mixture of marsh and lake and bog. The roads are few, and advance must therefore be slow and difficult. Rennenkampf made no attempt to delay him beyond a little rear-guard fighting. The German army reached the Niemen on September 21st, and found behind it the Russian army in prepared positions, with large reinforcements from Vilna.  The river at this point was wide and deep, and hard to cross. The battle of the Niemen Crossings was an artillery duel. The Russians quietly waited in their trenches to watch the Germans build their pontoon bridges. Then their guns blew the bridges to pieces. Thereupon von Hindenburg bombarded the Russian lines hoping to destroy the Russian guns. On Friday, the 26th, his guns boomed all day; the Russians made no reply. So on the morning of the 27th he built bridges again, and again the Russians blew them to pieces. On the 28th he gave the order for retreat.  He realized that the game wasn\\'t worth the candle; he might easily be kept fighting on the Niemen for months, while the main armies of the Russians were crossing Austria. Von Hindenburg conducted the retreat with a skill which came to him naturally from his knowledge of the marshes.  Rennenkampf followed him closely, keeping up persistent attacks through the woods and marshes. The path of the retreating army lay through the forest of Augustovo, a country much like that around the Masurian Lakes, and there the Germans suffered heavy losses. Von Hindenburg managed, however, to get the bulk of his forces back across the frontier and continued his retreat to the intrenchments on the Masurian Lakes.  The Germans lost 60,000 men in killed, wounded and prisoners, and von Hindenburg handed over the command of the German armies in East Prussia to General von Schubert, and hastened south to direct the movement to relieve the Austrians at Cracow.  But quite as important as the campaign in East Prussia was the struggle in Galicia. When the war began the Germans contemplated merely defense in their own domain; such offense as was planned was left to the Austrians farther south.  Galicia is a long, level country lying north of the Carpathian Mountains, and in this country Austria-Hungary had gathered together a force of hardly less than one million men. A quarter of these lay in reserve near the mountains; the remaining three-quarters was divided into two armies; the first, the northern army, being under the command of General Dankl, the second was that of von Offenberg. The base of the first army was Przemysl; that of the second was Lemberg.  The first army, it was planned, was to advance into Russian territory in the direction of Lublin. The second army, stationed southeast of the first army, was to protect it from any Russians who might strike in upon the south. The first army, therefore, contained more picked material than the second, which included many troops from the southern parts of the empire, including certain disaffected contingents. The first army made its advance as soon as possible, and entered Russian territory on the 11th of August. It went forward with very little loss and against very little resistance. The Russian forces which were against it were inferior in number, and fell back towards the Bug. The Austrians followed, turning somewhat toward the east, when their advance was checked by news of catastrophe in their rear. On the 14th of August the Russian army under General Ruzsky crossed the frontier, and advanced toward the Austrian second army.  The Russian army was in far greater strength than had been expected, and when its advance was followed by the appearance upon the right flank of von Offenberg\\'s command, of yet another Russian army, under Brussilov, the Austrian second army found itself in great danger. Ruzsky advanced steadily from August 14th until, on the 21st, it was not more than one day\\'s advance from the outer works of Lemberg, and the third Russian army under Brussilov was threatening von Offenberg\\'s right flank.  Von Offenberg, underestimating the strength of the enemy, undertook to give battle. The first outpost actions were successful for the Austrians, and helped them in their blunder. On the 24th of August the two Russian armies effected a junction, and their Austrian opponents found themselves threatened with disaster. An endeavor was made to retreat, but the retreat turned into a rout. On the 28th Tarnopol was captured by the Russians, and the Austrian army found itself compelled to fall back upon defense positions to the south and east of Lemberg itself.  The attack of the Russian armies was completely successful. The Austrian army was driven from its positions, and on September 4th the Austrians evacuated Lemberg and the Russian forces took possession of the town. The Austrians fled. The population welcomed the conquerors with the greatest enthusiasm. An immense quantity of stores of every kind were captured by the Russians together with at least 100,000 prisoners. There was no looting, nor any kind of outrage. The Russian policy was to make friends of the inhabitants of Galicia.  But there was no halt after Lemberg. Brussilov divided his army, and sent his left wing into the Carpathian passes; his center and right moved west toward Przemysl; while Ruzsky moved northwest to reinforce the Russian army on the Bug. Meanwhile the position of Dankl\\'s army was perilous in the extreme. There were two possible courses, one to fall back and join the remnants of von Offenberg\\'s army, the other to attack at once, before the first Russian army could be reinforced, and if victorious to turn on Ruzsky.  Dankl\\'s army was now very strong. He had received reinforcements, not only from Austria but from Germany. On the 4th of September he attacked the Russian center; his attack was a failure, although he outnumbered the Russians. The battle continued until the tenth.  Everywhere the Austrians were beaten, and driven off in ignominious retreat. The whole Austrian force fled southward in great disorder; a part directed its flight toward Przemysl, others still farther west toward Cracow. Austria had been completely defeated. Poland was clear of the enemy. The Russian flag flew over Lemberg, while the Russian army was marching toward Cracow. The Russian star was in the ascendant.  But the Austrian armies had not been annihilated. An army of nearly a million men cannot be destroyed in so short a time. The Austrian failure was due in part to the disaffection of some of the elements of the army, and in part to the poor Austrian generalship. They had underestimated their foe, and ventured on a most perilous plan of campaign.  Russian generalship had been most admirable, and the Russian generals were men of ability and experience. Brussilov had seen service in the Turkish War of 1877. Ruzsky was a professor in the Russian War Academy. In the Japanese war he had been chief of staff to General Kaulbars, the commander of the Second Manchurian army. Associated with him was General Radko Dmitrieff, an able officer with a most interesting career. General Dmitrieff was born in Bulgaria, when it was a Turkish province. He graduated at the Military School at Sofia, and afterwards at the War Academy at Petrograd. On his return to Bulgaria he commanded a regiment in the Serbian-Bulgarian war. Later he became mixed up in the conspiracy against Prince Alexander, and was forced to leave Bulgaria. For ten years he served in the Russian army, returning to Bulgaria on the accession of Prince Ferdinand. Later on he became Chief of the General Staff, and when the Balkan war broke out he commanded one of the Bulgarian armies, won several important victories, and became a popular hero of the war. Disgusted with the political squabbles which followed the war, he returned to Russia as a general in the Russian army. With men like these in command, the Russian Empire was well served.  After the decisive defeat of the Austrian army under General Dankl, certain changes were made in the Russian High Command. General Ruzsky was made commander of the center, which was largely reinforced. General Ivanov was put in command of the armies operating in Galicia with Dmitrieff and Brussilov as his chief lieutenants. Brussilov\\'s business was to seize the deep passes in the Carpathians and to threaten Hungary. Dmitrieff\\'s duty was to press the Austrian retreat, and capture the main fortresses of central Galicia.  There are two great fortresses on the River San, Jaroslav and Przemysl, both of them controlling important railroad routes. Jaroslav on the main line from Lemberg to Cracow, Przemysl with a line which skirts the Carpathians, and connects with lines going south to Hungary. Jaroslav was fortified by a strong circle of intrenchments and was looked to by Austria for stout resistance. The Austrians were disappointed, for Ivanov captured it in three days, on the 23d of September. Dmitrieff found Przemysl a harder nut to crack. It held out for many months, while operations of greater importance were being carried on by the Russian armies. The plans of the Russian generals in some respects were not unlike the plan previously suggested as that of the German High Command. At the beginning of the war they had no desire to carry on a powerful offensive against Germany. The expedition into East Prussia was conducted more for political than for military purposes. The real offensive at the start was to be against Austria. The Russian movements were cautious at first, but the easy capture of Lemberg, the fall of Jaroslav, and the demoralization of the Austrian armies, encouraged more daring strategy. With the Germans stopped on the north, little aid to the Austrians could come from that source. The Grand Duke Nicholas was eager to strike a great blow before the winter struck in, so his armies swept to the great Polish city of Cracow. The campaign against Austria also had a political side.  Russia had determined upon a new attitude toward Poland. On August 15th the Grand Duke Nicholas, on behalf of the Czar, had issued a proclamation offering self-government to Russian Poland. Home rule for Poland had long been a favorite plan with the Czar. Now he promised, not only to give Russian Poland home rule, but to add to it the Polish peoples in Austria and Germany. This meant that Austria and Germany would have to give up Galicia on the one hand, and Prussian Poland on the other, if they should lose the war. In the old days Poland had been one of the greatest kingdoms in Europe, with a proud nobility and high civilization. She was one of the first of the great Slav peoples to penetrate the west. Later she had protected Europe against Tartar invasion, but internal differences had weakened her, and, surrounded by enemies, she had first been plundered, and later on divided between Austria, Russia and Prussia. Never had the Poles consented to this destruction of their independence. Galicia had constantly struggled against Austria; Prussian Poland was equally disturbing to the Prussian peace, and Russia was only able to maintain the control of her Polish province by the sword.  Of the three the Pole was probably more inclined to keep on friendly terms with Russia, also a Slav people. The policy of the Czar encouraged this inclination and produced disaffection among the Poles in Galicia and in Posen. Moreover, it gave Russia the sympathy of the world which had long regarded the partition of Poland as a political crime. It encouraged the Czecho-Slavs and other dissatisfied portions of the Austrian Empire.  The results were seen immediately in the demoralization of the Austrian armies where considerable numbers of Czecho-Slovak troops deserted to the Russian army, and later in the loyalty to Russia of the Poles, and their refusal, even under the greatest German pressure, to give the German Empire aid.    CHAPTER X  THE STRUGGLE FOR SUPREMACY ON THE SEA  Captain Mahan\\'s thesis that in any great war the nation possessing the greater sea power is likely to win, was splendidly illustrated during the World War.  The great English fleets proved the insuperable obstacle to the ambitious German plans of world dominion. The millions of soldiers landed in France from Great Britain, and its provinces, the millions of Americans transported in safety across the water, and the enormous quantities of supplies put at the disposal of the Allies depended, absolutely, upon the Allied control of the sea routes of the world. With a superior navy a German blockade of England would have brought her to terms in a short period, and France, left to fight alone, would have been an easy victim. The British navy saved the world.  Germany had for many years well understood the necessity of power upon the sea. When the war broke out it was the second greatest of the sea powers. Its ships were mostly modern, for its navy was a creation of the past fifteen years, and its development was obviously for the purpose of attacking the British supremacy. The father of this new navy was a naval officer by the name of von Tirpitz, who, in 1897, had become the German Naval Minister. With the aid of the Emperor he had aroused among the Germans a great enthusiasm for maritime power, and had built up a navy in fifteen years, which was second only to the English navy.  Von Tirpitz was an interesting character. In appearance he looked like an old sea-wolf who had passed his life on the wave, but such a thought would be a mistake. The great admiral\\'s work was done on land; he was an organizer, a diplomatist, and a politician. He created nothing new; in all its details he merely copied the English fleet. He is tall, heavily built, with a great white beard, forked in the middle. He is a man of much dignity, with a smile which has won him renown. He might have been Chancellor of the Empire but he preferred to devote himself to the navy, to prove that the future of Germany is on the seas. His glories are the Lusitania, the fleet safely anchored at Kiel, and the long rows of innocent victims of the submarine.  He was born in 1850 at Kustrion on the Ildor, when the German navy was only a little group of worthless boats. In 1865 he entered the School of Cadets, in 1869 he was gazetted lieutenant, in 1875 he was lieutenant-commander with a reputation as an able organizer. In 1891 he was appointed Chief of Staff at Kiel. This was his opportunity, and he set himself at the task of creating and protecting the submarine division of the navy. As time went on he grew in importance. In 1898 he became Assistant Secretary of State at the Admiralty in Berlin. Two years later he became vice-admiral. His admirers recognized his powers, and he was called the master. In 1899 a patent of nobility was conferred upon him. In 1902 he gained permission to build 13,000-ton war ships, and the following year he was made admiral. In 1907 enormous appropriations were made at his desire for the enlargement of the fleet. In 1908 Emperor William conferred on him the Order of the Black Eagle. In 1914 the Kiel Canal was completed under his direction, and he informed the Emperor that the fleet was ready. It is only fair to add that in all his plans he had the active support of his Imperial Master. The Kaiser, too, had dreamed a dream. Von Tirpitz admired the English. His children had been brought up in England, as was also his wife. He imitated the English, but on the day of the declaration of war he absolutely forbade his family to talk English, and he made a bonfire of his fine scientific library of English books. The Kaiser treated Von Tirpitz as his friend, asked his advice, and followed his counsel. His son, Sub-Lieutenant Wolf Von Tirpitz, studied at Oxford, and is on the most friendly terms with many English gentlemen of importance. He was on board the Mainz, which was sunk off Helgoland in August, 1916. In full uniform he swam for twenty minutes, before being picked up by one of the boats of the cruiser Liverpool. He was a lucky prisoner of war. The German battleships and cruisers which represent the toil of von Tirpitz for more than half a century, lay hidden away in the shelter of the Kiel Canal during the war to be ingloriously surrendered at its end. His name will remain linked with that of the Lusitania.

[Illustration: Painting: Torpedo crossing behind the path of a small ship.]   Copyright International Film Service.   ESCAPING A TORPEDO BY RAPID MANEUVERING   This destroyer escaped a torpedo from a hunted submarine by quickly   turning. Generally the torpedo travels at about fifteen feet under   water.   The German High Sea Fleet, at the beginning of the war, consisted of forty-one battleships, seven battle cruisers, nine armored cruisers, forty-nine light cruisers, one hundred and forty-five destroyers, eighty torpedo boats, and thirty-eight submarines. Under the direction of Von Tirpitz the navy had become democratic and had drawn to it many able men of the middle class. Its training was highly specialized and the officers were enthusiasts in their profession. The navy of Austria-Hungary had also expanded in recent years under the inspiration of Admiral Montecuculi. At the outbreak of the war the fleet comprised sixteen battleships, two armored and twelve light cruisers, eighteen destroyers, eighty-five torpedo boats and eleven submarines. The Allies were much more powerful. The French navy had in the matter of invention given the lead to the world, but its size had not kept pace with its quality. At the beginning of the war France had thirty-one battleships, twenty-four armored cruisers, eight light cruisers, eighty-seven destroyers, one hundred and fifty-three torpedo boats and seventy-six submarines. Russia, after the war with Japan, had begun the creation of a powerful battle fleet, which had not been completed when war was declared. At that time she had on the Baltic four dreadnaughts, ten armored cruisers, two light cruisers, eighty destroyers and twenty-four submarines, and a fleet of about half the strength in the Black Sea.  The English fleet had reached a point of efficiency which was unprecedented in its history. The progress of the German sea power had stimulated the spirit of the fleet, and led to a steady advance in training and equipment. The development of armament, and of battleship designing, the improvement in gunnery practice, the revision of the rate of pay, the opening up of careers from the lower deck, and the provision of a naval air service are landmarks in the advance. In the navy estimates of March, 1914, Parliament sanctioned over 51,000,000 Pounds for a naval defense, the largest appropriation for the purpose ever made. The home fleet was arranged in three units, the first fleet was divided into four battle squadrons, together with the flagship of the commander-in-chief. The first squadron was made up of eight battleships, the second squadron contained eight, the third eight and the fourth four. Attached to each fleet was a battle cruiser squadron, consisting of four ships in the first fleet, four in the second, four in the third and five in the fourth.  The fourth also contained a light cruiser squadron, a squadron of six gunboats for mine sweeping, and four flotillas of destroyers, each with a flotilla cruiser attached. The second fleet was composed of two battle squadrons, the first containing eight pre-dreadnaughts, and the second six. Attached to this fleet were also two cruiser squadrons, a mine layer squadron of seven vessels, four patrol flotillas, consisting of destroyers and torpedo boats, and seven flotillas of submarines. A third fleet contained two battle squadrons, mainly composed of old ships, with six cruiser squadrons. The English strength, outside home waters, consisted of the Mediterranean fleet, containing three battle cruisers, four armored cruisers, four ordinary cruisers and a flotilla of seventeen destroyers, together with submarines and torpedo boats. In eastern waters there were a battleship, two cruisers, and four sloops. In the China squadron there were one battleship, two armored cruisers, two ordinary cruisers, and a number of gunboats, destroyers, submarines, and torpedo boats. In New Zealand there were four cruisers. The Australian fleet contained a battle cruiser, three ordinary cruisers, three destroyers and two submarines. Other cruisers and gunboats were stationed at the Cape, the west coast of Africa, and along the western Atlantic. At the outbreak of the war two destroyers were purchased from Chile, and two Turkish battleships, building in England, were commandeered by the government.  It is evident that the union of France and Britain made the Allies easily superior in the Mediterranean Sea, so that France was able to transport her African troops in safety, and the British commerce with India and the East could safely continue. The main field of the naval war, therefore, was the North Sea and the Baltic, where Germany had all her fleet, except a few naval raiders. The entrance to the Baltic was closed to the enemy by Denmark, which, as a neutral, was bound to prevent an enemy fleet from passing. Germany, however, by means of the Kiel Canal, could permit the largest battle fleet to pass from the Baltic to the North Sea. The German High Sea Fleet was weaker than the British home fleet by more than forty per cent, and the German policy, therefore, was to avoid a battle, until, through mine layers and submarines, the British power should have been sufficiently weakened. The form of the German coast made this plan easily possible. The various bays and river mouths provided safe retreat for the German ships, and the German fleet were made secure by the fortifications along the coast. On July the 29th, 1914, at the conclusion of the annual maneuvers, instead of being demobilized as would have been usual, the Grand Fleet of Great Britain sailed from Portland along the coast into the mists, and from that moment dominated the whole course of the war.  From the 4th of August, the date of the declaration of war, the oceans of the world were practically rid of enemy war ships, and were closed to enemy mercantile marine. Although diplomacy had not yet failed, the masters of the English navy were not caught napping. The credit for this readiness has been given to Mr. Winston Churchill, one of the first Lords of the Admiralty, who had divined the coming danger. When the grand fleet sailed it seemed to disappear from English view. Occasionally some dweller along the coast might see an occasional cruiser or destroyer sweeping by in the distance, but the great battleships had gone. Somewhere, in some hidden harbor, lay the vigilant fleets of England.  Sea fighting had changed since the days of Admiral Nelson. The old wooden ship belonged to a past generation. The guns of a battleship would have sunk the Spanish Armada with one broadside. In this modern day the battleship was protected by aircraft, which dropped bombs from the clouds. Unseen submarines circled about her. Beneath her might be mines, which could destroy her at the slightest touch. Everything had changed but the daring of the English sailor.  In command of the Home fleet was Admiral Sir John Jellicoe. He had had a distinguished career. Beginning as a lieutenant in the Egyptian War of 1882, he had become a commander in 1891. In 1897 he became a captain, and served in China, commanding the Naval Brigade in the Pekin Expedition of 1900, where he was severely wounded. Later he became naval assistant to the Controller of the Navy, Director of Naval Ordnance and Torpedoes, Rear-Admiral in the United Fleet, Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty and Controller of the Navy, Vice-Admiral commanding the Atlantic fleet, Vice-Admiral commanding the second division of the Home fleet, and second Sea Lord of the Admiralty. He had distinguished himself in the naval maneuvers of 1913, and was one of the officers mainly responsible for the development of the modern English navy. He had the confidence of his colleagues, and a peculiar popularity among the British seamen.  On the day after the declaration of war, the first shots were fired. German mine layers, it is now believed, in disguise, had been dropping mines during the preceding week over a wide area of the North Sea. On the 5th of August the mine layer, Koenigen Luise, was sunk by the destroyer Lance, and on August 6th the British light cruiser Amphion struck one of the mines laid by the Koenigen Luise and was sunk with great loss of life. On August 9th, German submarines attacked a cruiser squadron without causing any damage, and one submarine was sunk.  It was in the Mediterranean, however, that the greatest interest was felt during the first week of the war. Two German war ships, the Goeben and the Breslau, were off the Algerian coast when war broke out. It is probable that when these ships received their sailing orders, Germany depended on the assistance of Italy, and had sent these ships to its assistance. They were admirably suited for commerce destroyers. They began by bombarding the Algerian coast towns of Bona and Phillipe, doing little damage. They then turned toward the coast of Gibraltar, but found before them the British fleet. Eluding the British they next appeared at Messina. There the captains and officers made their wills and deposited their valuables, including signed portraits of the Kaiser, with the German consul. The decks were cleared for action, and with the bands playing they sailed out under a blood-red sunset.  However, they seem to have been intent only on escape, and they went at full speed eastward toward the Dardanelles, meeting in their way only with the British cruiser Gloucester, which, though much inferior in size, attacked them boldly but was unable to prevent their escape. On entering Constantinople they were reported as being sold to the Turkish Government, the Turks thus beginning the line of conduct which was ultimately to bring them into the war.  Picturesque as this incident was it was of no importance as compared with the great British blockade of Germany which began on the 4th of August. German merchantmen in every country of the empire were seized, and hundreds of ships were captured on the high seas. Those who escaped to neutral ports were at once interned. In a week German commerce had ceased to exist. A few German cruisers were still at large but it was not long before they had been captured, or driven into neutral ports. Among the most picturesque of these raiders were the Emden and the Koenigsberg. The Emden, in particular, interested the world with her romantic adventures. Her story is best told in the words of Lieutenant-Captain von Mucke, and Lieutenant Gyssing, whose return to Germany with forty-four men, four officers and one surgeon, after the destruction of the ship, was a veritable Odyssey.   [Illustration: Painting]   A BATTLE OF FOUR ELEMENTS   British monitors shelling the German land batteries near Nieuport.   German submarines were actively engaged in trying to torpedo these   monitors and the British monoplane was useful for giving the range to   the ship and reporting the accuracy of the shots.   [Illustration: Painting]   TORPEDOING OF THE BRITISH BATTLESHIP, \"ABOUKIR\"   In the first few weeks of the war, when the navies of the world were   still at open warfare, during a sharp engagement off the Hook of   Holland in the North Sea the British warships \"Aboukir\", \"Cressy\" and   \"Hogue\" fell victims to the enemy. This sketch shows the \"Aboukir\"   after a German torpedo had found its mark in her hull.   \"We on the Emden had no idea where we were going, as, on August 11, 1914, we separated from the cruiser squadron, escorted only by the coaler Markomannia. Under way the Emden picked up three officers from German steamers. That was a piece of luck, for afterward we needed many officers for the capturing and sinking of steamers, or manning them when we took them with us. On September 10th, the first boat came in sight. We stopped her; she proved to be a Greek tramp returning from England. On the next day we met the Indus, bound for Bombay, all fitted up as a troop transport, but still without troops. That was the first one we sunk. The crew we took aboard the Markomannia. Then we sank the Lovat, a troop transport ship, and took the Kambinga along with us. One gets used quickly to new forms of activity. After a few days, capturing ships became a habit. Of the twenty-three which we captured most of them stopped after our first signal; when they didn\\'t, we fired a blank shot. Then they all stopped. Only one, the Clan Matteson, waited for a real shot across the bow before giving up its many automobiles and locomotives to the seas.  \"The officers were mostly very polite, and let down rope ladders for us. After a few hours they would be on board with us. We ourselves never set foot in their cabins, nor took charge of them. The officers often acted on their own initiative, and signaled to us the nature of their cargo. Then the commandant decided as to whether to sink the ship or take it with us. Of the cargo we always took every thing we could use, particularly provisions. Many of the English officers and sailors made good use of the hours of transfer to drink up the supply of whisky instead of sacrificing it to the waves. I heard that one captain was lying in tears at the enforced separation from his beloved ship, but on investigation found that he was merely dead drunk, The captain on one ship once called out cheerily \\'Thank God, I\\'ve been captured.\\' He had received expense money for the trip to Australia, and was now saved half the journey.\"  Parenthetically it may be remarked, that the Emden\\'s captain, Karl von Mueller, conducted himself at all times with chivalrous bravery, according to the accounts of the English themselves, who in their reports say of him, admiringly, \"He played the game.\" Captain von Mucke\\'s account continues:  \"We had mostly quiet weather, so that communication with captured ships was easy. They were mostly dynamited, or else shot close to the water line. At Calcutta we made one of our richest hauls, the Diplomat, chock full of tea, we sunk $2,500,000 worth. On the same day the Trabbotch, too, which steered right straight towards us, was captured. By now we wanted to beat it out of the Bay of Bengal, because we had learned from the papers that the Emden was being keenly searched for. By Rangoon we encountered a Norwegian tramp, which, for a cash consideration, took over all the rest of our prisoners of war.  \"On September 23d we reached Madras, and steered straight for the harbor. We stopped still 3,000 yards before the city. Then we shot up the oil tanks; three or four of them burned up and illuminated the city. Two days later we navigated around Ceylon, and could see the lights of Colombo. On the same evening we gathered in two more steamers, the King Lund, and Tywerse. The next evening we got the Burresk, a nice steamer with 500 tons of nice Cardiff coal. Then followed in order, the Ryberia, Foyle, Grand Ponrabbel, Benmore, Troiens, Exfort, Graycefale, Sankt Eckbert, Chilkana. Most of them were sunk. The coal ships were kept. All this happened before October 20th. Then we sailed southward to Deogazia, southwest of Colombo.\"  The captain then tells with much gusto a story of a visit paid to the Emden by some English farmers, at Deogazia, who were entertained royally by the Emden officers. They knew nothing about the war, and the Emden officers told them nothing. His narrative continues:  \"Now we went toward Miniko, where we sank two ships more. On the next day we found three steamers to the north, one of them with much desired Cardiff coal. From English papers on the captured ships we learned that we were being hotly pursued. One night we started for Penang. On October 28th we raised a very practicable fourth smokestack (for disguise). The harbor of Penang lies in a channel difficult of access. There was nothing doing by night. We had to do it at daybreak. At high speed, without smoke, with lights out, we steered into the mouth of the channel. A torpedo boat on guard slept well. We steamed past its small light. Inside lay a dark silhouette. That must be a warship. We recognized the silhouette dead sure. That was the Russian cruiser Jemtchud. There it lay, there it slept like a rat, no watch to be seen. They made it easy for us. Because of the narrowness of the harbor we had to keep close; we fired the first torpedo at four hundred yards.  \"Then, to be sure, things livened up a bit on the sleeping warship. At the same time we took the crew quarters under fire five shells at a time. There was a flash of flame on board, then a kind of burning aureole. After the fourth shell the flame burned high. The first torpedo had struck the ship too deep, because we were too close to it. A second torpedo which we fired off from the other side didn\\'t make the same mistake. After twenty seconds there was absolutely not a trace of the ship to be seen.  \"But now another ship which we couldn\\'t see was firing. That was the French D\\'Ivrebreville, toward which we now turned at once. A few minutes later an incoming torpedo destroyer was reported. It proved to be the French torpedo boat Mousquet. It came straight toward us. That\\'s always remained a mystery to me, for it must have heard the shooting. An officer whom we fished up afterward explained to me that they had only recognized we were a German warship when they were quite close to us. The Frenchman behaved well, accepted battle and fought on, but was polished off by us with three broadsides. The whole fight with those ships lasted half an hour. The commander of the torpedo boat lost both legs by the first broadside. When he saw that part of his crew were leaping overboard he cried out \\'Tie me fast. I will not survive after seeing Frenchmen desert their ship.\\' As a matter of fact he went down with his ship, as a brave captain, lashed fast to the mast. That was my only sea-fight.  \"On November 9th I left the Emden in order to destroy the wireless plant on the Cocos Island. I had fifty men, four machine guns and about thirty rifles. Just as we were about to destroy the apparatus it reported \\'Careful. Emden near.\\' The work of destruction went smoothly. Presently the Emden signaled to us \\'Hurry up.\\' I pack up, but simultaneously wails the Emden\\'s siren. I hurry up to the bridge, see the flag \\'Anna\\' go up. That means weigh anchor. We ran like mad into our boat, but already the Emden\\'s pennant goes up, the battle flag is raised, they fire from starboard. The enemy is concealed by the island, and therefore not to be seen, but I see the shell strike the water. To follow and catch the Emden is out of question. She is going twenty knots, I only four with my steam pinnace. Therefore I turn back to land, raise the flag, declare German laws of war in force, seize all arms, set out my machine guns on shore in order to guard against a hostile landing. Then I run again in order to observe the fight.\"  The cable operator at Cocos Island gives the following account of what happened from this point. After describing the sudden flight of the Emden, he goes on: \"Looking to the eastward we could see the reason for this sudden departure, for a warship, which we afterwards learned was the Australian cruiser Sydney, was coming up at full speed in pursuit. The Emden did not wait to discuss matters, but, firing her first shot at a range of about 3,700 yards, steamed north as hard as she could go. At first the firing of the Emden seemed excellent, while that of the Sydney was somewhat erratic. This, as I afterward learned, was due to the fact that the Australian cruiser\\'s range finder was put out of action by one of the only two shots the Germans got home. However, the British gunners soon overcame any difficulties that this may have caused, and settled down to their work, so that before long two of the Emden\\'s funnels had been shot away. She also lost one of her masts quite early in the fight. Both blazing away with their big guns the two cruisers disappeared below the horizon, the Emden being on fire.  \"Early the next morning, Tuesday, November 10th, we saw the Sydney returning, and at 8.45 A. M. she anchored off the island. From various members of the crew I gathered some details of the running fight with the Emden. The Sydney, having an advantage in speed, was able to keep out of range of the Emden\\'s guns, and to bombard with her own heavier metal. The engagement lasted eighty minutes, the Emden finally running ashore on North Keeling Island, and becoming an utter wreck. Only two German shots proved effective, one of these failed to explode, but smashed the main range finder and killed one man, the other killed three men and wounded fourteen.  \"Each of the cruisers attempted to torpedo the other, but both were unsuccessful, and the duel proved a contest in hard pounding at long range. The Sydney\\'s speed during the fighting was twenty-six knots, and the Emden\\'s twenty-four knots. The British ship\\'s superiority of two knots enabled her to choose the range at which the battle should be fought and to make the most of her superior guns. Finally, with a number of wounded prisoners on board, the Sydney left here yesterday, and our few hours of war excitement were over.\"  Captain Mucke\\'s return home from the Cocos Island was filled with the most extraordinary adventures, and when he finally arrived in country controlled by his Allies he was greeted as a hero.  While the story of the Emden especially interested the world, the Koenigsberg also caused much trouble to English commerce. Her chief exploit occurred on the 20th of September, when she caught the British cruiser Pegasus in Zanzibar harbor undergoing repairs. The Pegasus had no chance, and was destroyed by the Koenigsberg\\'s long-range fire. Nothing much was heard later of the Koenigsberg, which was finally destroyed by an English cruiser, July 11, 1915.  The exploits of these two German commerce raiders attracted general attention, because they were the exceptions to the rule. The British, on the other hand, were able to capture such German merchantmen as ventured on the sea without great difficulty, and as they did not destroy their capture, but brought them before prize courts, the incidents attracted no great attention. The Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse, which had been fitted up as a commerce destroyer by the Germans at the beginning of the war, as was the Spreewald of the Hamburg-American Line, and the Cap Trafalgar, were caught and sunk during the month of September. On the whole, English foreign trade was unimpaired.  But though the German fleet had been bottled up in her harbors, Germany was not yet impotent. There remained the submarine.  Up to 1905 Germany had not a single submarine. The first German submarine was launched on August 30, 1905. Even then it was considered merely an experiment. In February, 1907, it was added to the register of the fleet. On January 1, 1901, there were only four nations that possessed submarines, France, with fourteen; the United States, with eight; England, with six, of which not one was completed, and finally Italy, with two. In 1910, Germany appropriated 18,750,000 marks for submarines, and in 1913, 25,000,000 marks. On January 1, 1914, the total number of submarines of all nations was approximately four hundred.  Early in the war the submarine became a grave menace to the English navy and to English commerce. On the 5th of September the Pathfinder, a light cruiser, was torpedoed and sunk with great loss of life. On September 22d, three cruisers, the Cressy, Hogue, and Aboukir were engaged in patrolling the coast of Holland. A great storm had been raging and the cruisers were not protected by the usual screen of destroyers. At half-past six in the morning the seas had fallen and the cruisers proceeded to their posts. The report of Commander Nicholson, of the Cressy, of what followed gives a good idea of the effectiveness of the submarine.  \"The Aboukir,\" says this report, \"was struck at about 6.25 A. M. on the starboard beam. The Hogue and Cressy closed, and took up a position, the Hogue ahead of the Aboukir, and the Cressy about four hundred yards on her port beam. As soon as it was seen that the Aboukir was in danger of sinking, all the boats were sent away from the Cressy, and a picket boat was hoisted out without steam up. When cutters full of the Aboukir\\'s men were returning to the Cressy, the Hogue was struck, apparently under the aft 9.2 magazine, as a very heavy explosion took place immediately. Almost directly after the Hogue was hit we observed a periscope on our port bow about three hundred yards off. Fire was immediately opened, and the engines were put full speed ahead with the intention of running her down. . . .  \"Captain Johnson then maneuvered the ship so as to render assistance to the crews of the Hogue and Aboukir. About five minutes later another periscope was seen on our starboard quarter, and fire was opened. The track of the torpedo she fired at a range of from 500 to 600 yards was plainly visible, and it struck us on the starboard side just before the after bridge. The ship listed about ten degrees to the starboard and remained steady. The time was 7.15 A. M. All the water-tight doors, dead lights and scuttles had been securely closed before the torpedoes left the ship. All mess stools and table shores and all available timber below and on deck had been previously got up and thrown overside for the saving of life. A second torpedo fired by the same submarine missed and passed about ten feet astern.  \"About a quarter of an hour after the first torpedo had hit, a third torpedo fired from the submarine just before the starboard beam, hit us under the No. 5 boiler room. The time was 7.30 A. M. The ship then began to heel rapidly, and finally turned keel up remaining so for about twenty minutes before she finally sank. It is possible that the same submarine fired all three torpedoes at the Cressy.\"  Of the total crews of 1,459 officers and men only 779 were saved. The survivors believed that they had seen at least three submarines, but the German official account mentions only one, the U-9, under Captain-Lieutenant Otto Weddigen whose account of this battle confirms the report of Commander Nicholson. Referring to the reports that a flotilla of German submarines had attacked the cruisers, he says:  \"These reports were absolutely untrue. U-9 was the only submarine on deck.\" He adds: \"I reached the home port on the afternoon of the 23d and on the 24th went to Wilhelmshaven to find that news of my effort had become public. My wife, dry-eyed when I went away, met me with tears. Then I learned that my little vessel and her brave crew had won the plaudit of the Kaiser who conferred upon each of my co-workers the Iron Cross of the second class and upon me the Iron Crosses of the first and second classes.\"  Weddigen was the hero of the hour in Germany. He had with him twenty-five men. He seems to have acted with courage and skill, but it is also evident that the English staff work was to blame. Three such vessels should never have been sent out without a screen of destroyers, nor should the Hogue and the Cressy have gone to the rescue of the Aboukir. A few days after the disaster the English Admiralty issued the following statement:   The sinking of the Aboukir was of course an ordinary hazard of patrolling duty. The Hogue and Cressy, however, were sunk because they proceeded to the assistance of their consort, and remained with engines stopped, endeavoring to save life, thus presenting an easy target to further submarine attacks. The natural promptings of humanity have in this case led to heavy losses, which would have been avoided by a strict adhesion to military consideration. Modern naval war is presenting us with so many new and strange situations that an error of judgment of this character is pardonable. But it has become necessary to point out for the future guidance of His Majesty\\'s ships that the conditions which prevail when one vessel of a squadron is injured in the mine field, or is exposed to submarine attack, are analogous to those which occur in action, and that the rule of leaving ships to their own resources is applicable, so far, at any rate, as large vessels are concerned.   On the 28th of August occurred the first important naval action of the war, the battle of Helgoland. From the 9th of August German cruisers had shown activity in the seas around Helgoland and had sunk a number of British trawlers. The English submarines, E-6 and E-8, and the light cruiser Fearless, had patrolled the seas, and on the 21st of August the Fearless had come under the enemy\\'s shell fire. On August 26th the submarine flotilla, under Commodore Keyes, sailed from Harwich for the Bight of Helgoland, and all the next day the Lurcher and the Firedrake, destroyers, scouted for submarines. On that same day sailed the first and third destroyer flotillas, the battle cruiser squadron, first light cruiser squadron, and the seventh cruiser squadron, having a rendezvous at this point on the morning of the 28th.  The morning was beautiful and clear, so that the submarines could be easily seen. Close to Helgoland were Commodore Keyes\\' eight submarines, and his two small destroyers. Approaching rapidly from the northwest were Commodore Tyrwhitt\\'s two destroyer flotillas, a little to the east was Commodore Goodenough\\'s first light cruiser squadron. Behind this squadron were Sir David Beatty\\'s battle cruisers with four destroyers. To the south and west of Helgoland lay Admiral Christian\\'s seventh cruiser squadron.  Presently from behind Helgoland came a number of German destroyers, followed by two cruisers; and the English submarines, with the two small destroyers, fled westwards, acting as a decoy. As the Germans followed, the British destroyer flotillas on the northwest came rapidly down. At the sight of these destroyers the German destroyers fled, and the British attempted to head them off.  According to the official report the principle of the movement was to cut the German light craft from home, and engage it at leisure on the open sea.  But between the two German cruisers and the English cruisers a fierce battle took place. The Arethusa was engaged with the German Ariadne, and the Fearless with the Strasburg. A shot from the Arethusa shattered the fore bridge of the Ariadne and killed the captain, and both German cruisers drew off toward Helgoland.  Meanwhile the destroyers were engaged in a hot fight. They sunk the leading boat of the German flotilla and damaged a dozen more. Between nine and ten o\\'clock there was a lull in the fight; the submarines, with some of the destroyers, remained in the neighborhood of Helgoland, and the Germans, believing that these boats were the only hostile vessels in the neighborhood, determined to attack them.  The Mainz, the Koln, and the Strasburg came again on the scene, and opened a heavy fire on some of the boats of the first flotilla which were busy saving life. The small destroyers were driven away, but the seamen in the boats were rescued by an English submarine. The Arethusa and the Fearless, with the destroyers in their company, engaged with three enemy cruisers. The Strasburg, seriously injured, was compelled to flee. The boilers of the Mainz blew up, and she became a wreck. The Koln only remaining and carrying on the fight.  The English destroyers were much crippled, and as the battle had now lasted for five hours any moment the German great battleships might come on the scene. A wireless signal had been sent to Sir David Beatty, asking for help, and about twelve o\\'clock the Falmouth and the Nottingham arrived on the scene of action. By this time the first destroyer flotilla was out of action and the third flotilla and the Arethusa had their hands full with the Koln. The light cruisers were followed at 12.15 by the English battle cruisers, the Lion came first, and she alone among the battle cruisers seems to have used her guns. Her gun power beat down all opposition. The Koln made for home, but the Lion\\'s guns set her on fire. The luckless Ariadne hove in sight, but the terrible 13.5-inch guns sufficed for her. The battle cruisers circled around, and in ten minutes the Koln went to the bottom.  At twenty minutes to two, Admiral Beatty turned homeward. The German cruisers Mainz, Koln, and the Ariadne had been sunk; the Strasburg was seriously damaged. One destroyer was sunk, and at least seven seriously injured. About seven hundred of the German crew perished and there were three hundred prisoners. The British force returned without the loss of a single ship. The Arethusa had been badly damaged, but was easily repaired. The casualty list was thirty-two killed and fifty-two wounded. The battle was fought on both sides with great gallantry, the chief glory belonging to the Arethusa and the Fearless who bore the brunt of the battle. The strategy and tactical skill employed were admirable, and the German admiral, von Ingenohl from that time on, with one exception, kept his battleships in harbor, and confined his activities to mine laying and the use of submarines.  In the first days of the war the German mine layers had been busy. By means of trawlers disguised as neutrals, mines were dropped off the north coast of Ireland, and a large mine field was laid off the eastern coast of England. One of the most important duties of the Royal Naval Reserve was the task of mine sweeping. Over seven hundred mine-sweeping vessels were constantly employed in keeping an area of 7,200 square miles clear for shipping. These ships swept 15,000 square miles monthly, and steamed over 1,100,000 miles in carrying out their duties.  It would be hard to overestimate the effect of the British blockade of the German ports upon the fortunes of the war. The Germans for a long time attempted, by the use of neutral ships, to obtain the necessary supplies through Holland, Sweden, Norway, and Switzerland. Millions of dollars\\' worth of food and munitions ultimately reached German hands. The imports of all these nations were multiplied many times, but as the time went on the blockade grew stricter and stricter until the Germans felt the pinch. To conduct efficiently this blockade meant the use of over 3,600 vessels which were added to the auxiliary patrol service. Over 13,000 vessels were intercepted and examined by units of the British navy employed on blockade channels.  The Germans protested with great vigor against this blockade, and ultimately endeavored to counteract it by declaring unrestricted submarine warfare. In fact, Great Britain had gone too far, and vigorous protests from America followed her attempt to seize contraband goods in American vessels.  The code of maritime law, adopted in the Declaration at Paris of 1856, as well as the Declaration in London of 1909, had been framed in the interests of unmaritime nations. The British plenipotentiaries had agreed to these laws on the theory that in any war of the future Britain would be neutral. The rights of neutrals had been greatly increased. A blockade was difficult to enforce, for the right of a blockading power to capture a blockade runner did not cover the whole period of her voyage, and was confined to ships of the blockading force. A ship carrying contraband could only be condemned if the contraband formed more than half its cargo. A belligerent warship could destroy a neutral vessel without taking it into a port for a judgment. The transfer of an enemy vessel to a neutral flag was presumed to be valid, if effected more than thirty days before the outbreak of war. Belligerents in neutral vessels on the high seas were exempt from capture. The Emden could justify its sinking of British ships, but the English were handicapped in their endeavor to prevent neutral ships from carrying supplies to Germany.  But Germany had become a law unto itself. And England found it necessary in retaliation to issue orders in council which made nugatory many of the provisions of the maritime code. The protests of the American Government and those of other neutrals were treated with the greatest consideration, and every endeavor was made that no real injustice should be done. When America itself later entered the war these differences of opinion disappeared from public view.    CHAPTER XI  THE SUBLIME PORTE  As soon as the diplomatic relations between Austria and Serbia had been broken, the Turkish Grand Vizier informed the diplomatic corps in Constantinople that Turkey would remain neutral in the conflict. The declaration was not formal, for war had not yet been declared. The policy of Turkey, as represented in the ministerial paper, Tasfiri-Efkiar, was as follows:  \"Turkey has never asked for war, as she always has worked toward avoiding it, but neutrality does not mean indifference. The present Austro-Serbian conflict is to a supreme degree interesting to us. In the first place, one of our erstwhile opponents is fighting against a much stronger enemy. In the natural course of things Serbia, which till lately was expressing, in a rather open way, her solidarity as a nation, still provoking us, and Greece, will be materially weakened. In the second place, the results of this war may surpass the limits of the conflict between two countries, and in that case our interests will be just as materially affected. We must, therefore, keep our eyes open, as the circumstances are momentarily changing, and do not permit us to let escape certain advantages which we can secure by active, and rightly acting, diplomacy. The policy of neutrality will impose on us the obligation of avoiding to side with either of the belligerents. But the same policy will force us to take all the necessary measures for safeguarding our interests and our frontiers.\"  Whereupon a Turkish mobilization was at once ordered. The war had hardly begun when Turkey received the news that her two battleships, building in British yards, had been taken over by England. A bitter feeling against England was at once aroused, Turkish mobs proceeded to attack the British stores and British subjects, and attempts were even made against the British embassy in Constantinople, and the British consulate at Smyrna.  At this time Turkey was in a peculiar position. For a century she had been on the best of terms with France and Great Britain. On the other hand Russia had been her hereditary enemy. She was still suffering from her defeat by the Balkan powers, and her statesmen saw in this war great possibilities. She desired to recover her lost provinces in Europe, and saw at once that she could hope for little from the Allies in this direction.   [Illustration: Map: Black Sea to the North, Caspian Sea to the East, Persian Gulf to South, Crete to the West.]   SKETCH OF TERRITORY CONTROLLED BY TURKEY IN 1914   For some years, too, German intrigues, and, according to report, German money, had enabled the German Government to control the leading Turkish statesmen. German generals, under General Liman von Sanders, were practically in control of the Turkish army. The commander-in-chief was Enver Bey, who had been educated in Germany and was more German than the Germans. A new system of organization for the Turkish army had been established by the Germans, which had substituted the mechanical German system for the rough and inefficient Turkish methods. Universal conscription provided men, and the Turkish soldier has always been known as a good soldier. Yet as it turned out the German training did little for him. Under his own officers he could fight well, but under German officers, fighting for a cause which he neither liked nor understood, he was bound to fail.  At first the Turkish mobilization was conducted in such a way as to be ready to act in common with Bulgaria in an attack against Greek and Serbian Macedonia, as soon as the Austrians had obtained a decisive victory over the Serbians. The entry of Great Britain into the war interfered with this scheme. Meantime, though not at war, the Turks were suffering almost as much as if war had been declared. Greedy speculators took advantage of the situation, and the government itself requisitioned everything it could lay its hands on.  A Constantinople correspondent, writing on the 6th of August, says as follows;  \"Policemen and sheriffs followed by military officers are taking by force everything in the way of foodstuffs, entering the bakeries and other shops selling victuals, boarding ships with cargoes of flour, potatoes, wheat and rice, and taking over virtually everything, giving in lieu of payment a receipt which is not worth even the paper on which it is written. In this way many shops are forced to close, bread has entirely disappeared from the bakeries, and Constantinople, the capital of a neutral country, is already feeling all the troubles and privations of a besieged city. Prices for foodstuffs have soared to inaccessible heights, as provisions are becoming scarce. Actual hand-to-hand combats are taking place in the streets outside the bakeries for the possession of a loaf of bread, and hungry women with children in their arms are seen crying and weeping with despair. Many merchants, afraid lest the government requisition their goods, hasten to have their orders canceled, the result being that no merchandise of any kind is coming to Constantinople either from Europe or from Anatolia. Both on account of the recruiting of their employees, and of shortage of coal, the companies operating electric tramways of the city have reduced their service to the minimum, as no power is available for the running of the cars. Heartrending scenes are witnessed in front of the closed doors of the various banking establishments, where large posters are to be seen bearing the inscription \\'Closed temporarily by order of the government.\\'\"  Immediately after war was declared between Germany and Russia the Porte ordered the Bosporus and Dardanelles closed to every kind of shipping, at the same time barring the entrances of these channels with rows of mines. The first boat to suffer from this measure was a British merchantman which was sunk outside the Bosporus, while another had a narrow escape in the Dardanelles. A large number of steamers of every nationality waited outside the straits for the special pilot boats of the Turkish Government, in order to pass in safety through the dangerous mine field. This measure of closing the straits was suggested to Turkey by Austria and Germany, and was primarily intended against Russia, as it was feared that her Black Sea fleet might force its way into the Sea of Marmora and the AEgean.  On August 2d the Turkish Parliament was prorogued, so that all political power might center around the Imperial throne. A vigorous endeavor was made to strengthen the Turkish navy. Djemal Pasha was placed at its head with Arif Bey as chief of the naval staff. Talaat Bey and Halil Bey were sent to Bucharest to exchange views with Roumanian statesmen, and representatives of the Greek Government, in regard to the outstanding Greco-Turkish difficulties.  On September 10th an official announcement from the Sublime Porte was issued defining in the first place many constitutional reforms, and in particular abolishing the capitulation, that is, the concessions made by law to foreigners, allowing them participation in the administration of justice, exemption from taxation, and special protection in their business transactions. In abolishing these capitulations the Ottoman Government declared that it would treat foreign countries in accordance with the rules of international law, and that it was acting without any hostile feeling against any of the foreign states.  The Allied governments formally protested against this action of the Turkish Government. Meantime Constantinople was the center of most elaborate intrigues. The Turkish Government grew more and more warlike, and began to threaten, not only Greece, but Russia and the Triple Entente as well. During this period the Turkish press maintained an active campaign against England and the Allies. Every endeavor was made by the Sublime Porte to secure Roumanian or Bulgarian co-operation in a militant policy. The Allies, seeing the situation, made many promises to Bulgaria, Greece and Roumania. Bulgaria was offered Adrianople and Thrace; Greece was to have Smyrna, and Roumania the Roumanian provinces in Austria. The jealousy of these powers of each other prevented an agreement. The influence of Germany became more and more preponderant with the Ottoman Empire; indeed, it is probable that an understanding had existed between the two powers from the beginning. The action of the Turkish Government in regard to the Goeben and Breslau could hardly have been possible unless with a previous understanding. At last the rupture came. The following was the official Turkish version of the events which led to the Turkish declaration of war:  \"While on the 27th of October a small part of the Turkish fleet was maneuvering on the Black Sea, the Russian fleet, which at first confined its activities to following and hindering every one of our movements, finally, on the 29th, unexpectedly began hostilities by attacking the Ottoman fleet. During the naval battle which ensued the Turkish fleet, with the help of the Almighty, sank the mine layer Pruth, inflicted severe damage on one of the Russian torpedo boats, and captured a collier. A torpedo from the Turkish torpedo boat Gairet-i-Millet sank the Russian destroyer Koubanietz, and another from the Turkish torpedo boat Mouavenet-i-Millet inflicted serious damage on a Russian coast guard ship. Three officers and seventy-two sailors rescued by our men and belonging to the crews of the damaged and sunken vessels of the Russian fleet have been made prisoners. The Ottoman Imperial fleet, glory be given to the Almighty, escaped injury, and the battle is progressing favorably for us. Information received from our fleet, now in the Black Sea, is as follows:  \"From accounts of Russian sailors taken prisoners, and from the presence of a mine layer among the Russian fleet, evidence is gathered that the Russian fleet intended closing the entrance to the Bosporus with mines, and destroying entirely the Imperial Ottoman fleet, after having split it in two. Our fleet, believing that it had to face an unexpected attack, and supposing that the Russians had begun hostilities without a formal declaration of war, pursued the scattered Russian fleet, bombarded the port of Sebastopol, destroyed in the city of Novorossisk fifty petroleum depots, fourteen military transports, some granaries, and the wireless telegraph station. In addition to the above our fleet has sunk in Odessa a Russian cruiser, and damaged severely another. It is believed that this second boat was likewise sunk. Five other steamers full of cargoes lying in the same port were seriously damaged. A steamship belonging to the Russian volunteer fleet was also sunk, and five petroleum depots were destroyed. In Odessa and Sebastopol the Russians from the shore opened fire against our fleet.\"   [Illustration: Photographs and Paintings]   FAMOUS BRITISH GENERALS   General Smith-Dorrien, British Corps Commander in the famous retreat   from Mons; Generals Plumer, Rawlinson and Byng, Commanders on the   Western Front; General Birdwood, Commander of the Australian-New   Zealand troops at Gallipoli.   [Illustration: Photographs and Paintings]   FAMOUS FRENCH GENERALS   Marshal Petain, Commander-in-Chief of the French armies in the West;   Generals Mangin, Gouraud and Humbert, Army Commanders in the West;   Generals Gallieni, Commander of Paris, who sent forward an army in   taxicabs to save the day at the First Battle of the Marne.   The Sultan at once declared war against Russia, England and France, and issued a proclamation to his troops, declaring that he had called them to arms to resist aggression and that \"the very existence of our Empire and of three hundred million Moslems whom I have summoned by sacred Fetwa to a supreme struggle, depend on your victory. Do not forget that you are brothers in arms of the strongest and bravest armies of the world, with whom we are now fighting shoulder to shoulder.\"  The Fetwa, or proclamation announcing a holy war, called upon all Mussulmans capable of carrying arms, and even upon Mussulman women to fight against the powers with whom the Sultan was at war. In this manner the holy war became a duty, not only for all Ottoman subjects, but for the three hundred million Moslems of the earth. On November 5th Great Britain declared war against Turkey, ordered the seizure in British ports of Turkish vessels, and, by an order in Council, annexed the Island of Cyprus. On the 17th of December, the Khedive Abbas II, having thrown in his lot with Turkey and fled to Constantinople, Egypt was formally proclaimed a British Protectorate. The title of Khedive was abolished, and the throne of Egypt, with the title of Sultan, was offered to Prince Hussein Kamel Pasha, the eldest living prince of the house of Mahomet Ali, an able and enlightened man. This meant that Britain was now wholly responsible for the defense of Egypt. The new Sultan of Egypt made his state entry on December 20th into the Abdin Palace in Cairo. The progress of the new ruler was received with great enthusiasm by thousands of spectators.  The King of England sent a telegram of congratulation with his promise of support:   On the occasion when your Highness enters upon your high office I desire to convey to your Highness the expression of my most sincere friendship, and the assurance of my unfailing support in safeguarding the integrity of Egypt, and in securing her future well being and prosperity. Your Highness has been called upon to undertake the responsibilities of your high office at a grave crisis in the national life of Egypt, and I feel convinced that you will be able, with the co-operation of your Ministers, and the Protectorate of Great Britain, successfully to overcome all the influences which are seeking to destroy the independence of Egypt and the wealth, liberty and happiness of its people.   This was Britain\\'s answer to the Turkish proclamation of war. The Turks had not taken this warlike course with entire unanimity. The Sultan, the Grand Vizier, and Djavid Bey were in favor of peace, but Enver Pasha and his colleagues overruled them. The Odessa incident was unjustified aggression, deliberately planned to provoke hostilities. The tricky and corrupt German diplomacy had won its point.  It is interesting to observe that the proclamation of the holy war, a favorite German scheme, fell flat. The Kaiser, and his advisers, had counted much upon this raising of the sacred flag. The Kaiser had visited Constantinople and permitted himself to be exploited as a sympathizer with Mohammedanism. Photographs of him had been taken representing him in Mohammedan garb, accompanied by Moslem priests, and a report had been deliberately circulated throughout Turkey that he had become a Moslem. The object of this camouflage was to stir up the Mohammedans in the countries controlled by England, risings were hoped for in Egypt and India, and German spies had been distributed through those countries to encourage religious revolts. But there was almost no response. The Sultan, it is true, was the head of the Church, but who was the Sultan? The old Sultan, now dethroned, and imprisoned, or this new and insignificant creature placed on the throne by the young Turk party? The Mohammedan did not feel himself greatly moved.  At the beginning of the war Turkey found herself unable to make any move to recover her provinces in Thrace. Greece and Bulgaria were neutral, and could not be attacked. Placing herself, therefore, in the hands of her German advisers, she moved her new army to those frontiers where it could meet the powers with whom she was at war. In particular Germany and Austria desired her aid in Transcaucasia against the Russian armies. An attack upon Russia from that quarter would mean that many troops which otherwise would have been used against the Central Powers must be sent to the Caucasus. The Suez Canal, too, must be attacked. An expedition there would compel Great Britain to send out troops, and perhaps would encourage the hoped-for rebellion in Egypt and give an opportunity for religious insurrection in India, where the Djehad was being preached among the Mohammedan tribes in the northwest. The Dardanelles, to be sure, might be threatened but the Germans had sent there many heavy guns and fortifications had been built which, in expert opinion, made Constantinople safe.  The Turkish offensive along her eastern frontier in Transcaucasia and in Persia was first undertaken. The Persian Gulf had long been controlled by Great Britain; even in the days of Elizabeth the East India Company had fought with Dutch and Portuguese rivals for control of its commerce. The English had protected Persia, suppressed piracy and slavery, and introduced sanitary measures in the marshes along the coast. They regarded a control of the Persian Gulf as necessary for the prosperity of India and the Empire. The Turkish Government had never had great power along the Persian Gulf. Bagdad, indeed, had been captured by Suleiman the Magnificent in the sixteenth century, but in eastern Arabia lived many independent Arabian chieftains who had no idea of subjecting themselves to Turkish rule.  For years Germany had been looking with jealous eyes in this direction. Her elaborate intrigues with Turkey were mainly designed to open up the way to the Persian Gulf. She had planned a great railway to open up trade, and her endeavor to build the Bagdad Railway is a story in itself. Her efforts had lasted for many years, but she found herself constantly blocked by the agents of Great Britain.  Before the Ottoman troops were ready, the British in the Gulf had made a start. On November 7th a British force under Brigadier-General Delamain bombarded the Turkish fort at Falon, landed troops and occupied the village. Sailing north from this point they disembarked at Sanijah, where they intrenched themselves and waited for reinforcements. On November 13th reinforcements arrived, and on November 17th the British army advanced toward Sahain. From there they moved on Sahil, where they encountered a Turkish force. Some lively fighting ensued and the Turks broke and fled. Turkish casualties were about one thousand five hundred men, the English killed numbered thirty-eight.  The British then moved on Basra, moving by steamer along the Shat-el-Arab River. On November 22d Basra was reached and it was found that the Turks had evacuated the place. A base camp was then prepared, for it was certain that there would be further fighting. Bagdad was only about three hundred miles distant; and fifty miles above Basra, at the junction of the Tigris and the Euphrates, lies the town of Kurna where the Turks were gathering an army. On December 4th an attack was made on Kurna but without success. The British obtained reinforcements, but on December 9th the Turkish garrison surrendered unconditionally. The British troops then intrenched themselves, having established a barricade against a hostile advance upon India.  Farther north the war was between Turkey and Russia. Since Persia had no military power, each combatant was able to occupy that country whenever they desired. The Turks advanced into Persia south of Lake Urmia, and, meeting with no resistance from Persia, moved northward toward the Russian frontier. On the 30th of January, 1915, Russian troops heavily defeated the invaders and followed them south as far as Tabriz, which they occupied and held. The Russian armies had also undertaken movements in this section. In the extreme northwest of Persia a Russian column had crossed the frontier, and occupied, on the 3d of November, the town of Bayazid close to Mt. Ararat. Other columns entered Kurdestan, and an expedition against Van was begun. Further north another Russian column crossed the frontier and captured the town of Karakilissa, but was held there by the Turks.  These were minor expeditions. The real struggle was in Transcaucasia, where the main body of the Turkish army under Enver Pasha himself was in action. At this point the boundaries of Turkey touch upon the Russian Empire. To the north is the Great Russian fortress of Kars, to the south and west the Turkish stronghold of Erzerum. The whole district is a great mountain tangle, the towns standing at an altitude of 5,000 and 6,000 feet, surrounded by lofty hills. None of the roads are good, and in winter the passes are almost impassable. In all the wars between Russia and Turkey, these mountain regions have been the scenes of desperate battles.  The Turkish plan of battle was to entice the Russians from Sarakamish across the frontier, leading them on to some distance from their base, then, while holding their front, a second force was to swing around and attack them on the left flank. The plan was simple, the difficulty was the swing of the left flank, which had to be made through mountain paths, deeply covered with snow. The Turkish army was composed of about 150,000 men under the command of Hassan Izzet Pasha, but Enver, with a large German staff was the true commander. The Russian army, under General Woronzov was about 100,000 men.  Early in November the Russians crossed the frontier and reached Koprikeui, which they occupied on the 20th of November. The Turkish Eleventh corps was entrusted with the duty of holding the Russian forces; the remainder of the army was to advance over the passes and take their stations behind the Russian right. On December 25th the Turkish attack began. The Eleventh corps forced back the Russians from Koprikeui to Khorasan, while the extreme Turkish left was endeavoring to outflank them. But the weather was desperate. A blizzard was sweeping down the steeps. The Turkish forces were indeed able to carry out the plan, for they obtained the position desired. But by this time they were worn out, and half starved, and their attack on New Year\\'s Day resulted in their defeat and retreat. The Ninth corps was utterly wiped out, and the remainder of the Turkish forces driven off in confusion. Only the strenuous efforts of the Turkish Eleventh corps prevented a debacle. After a three days\\' battle it, too, was broken, and with heavy losses it retreated toward Erzerum. The snowdrifts and blizzards must have accounted for not less than 50,000 of the Turkish troops. The result of the battle made Russia safe in the Caucasus.  But the Germans had another use for the Turkish forces. England was in control of Egypt and the Suez Canal. The German view of England\\'s position has been well stated by Dr. Paul Rohrbach:  \"As soon as England acquired Egypt it was incumbent upon her to guard against any menace from Asia. Such a danger apparently arose when Turkey, weakened by her last war with Russia and by difficult conditions at home, began to turn to Germany for support. And now war has come, and England is reaping the crops which she has sown. England, not we, desired this war. She knows this, despite all her hypocritical talk, and she fears that, as soon as connection is established along the Berlin-Vienna-Budapest-Sofia-Constantinople Line, the fate of Egypt may be decided. Through the Suez Canal goes the route to all the lands surrounding the Indian Ocean, and by way of Singapore to the western shores of the Pacific. These two worlds together have about nine hundred million inhabitants, more than half the population of the universe, and India lies in a controlling position in their midst. Should England lose the Suez Canal she will be obliged, unlike the powers in control of that waterway, to use the long route around the Cape of Good Hope, and depend on the good will of the South African Boers. The majority among the latter have not the same views as Botha. However, it is too early to prophesy, and it is not according to German ideas to imitate our opponents by singing premature paeans of victory. But anyhow we are well aware why anxious England already sees us on the road to India.\"  Following out this view a Turkish force was directed toward the Suez Canal, while the German intriguers did their best to stir up revolt in Egypt itself. The story of Egypt is one of the most interesting parts of the world\\'s history. In the early days of the world it led mankind. Its peculiar geographical position at first gave it strength, and afterward made it the prize for which all nations were ready to contend. In 1517 the Sultan Selim conquered Egypt and made it part of the Turkish realm, and in spite of many changes the sovereignty of Constantinople had continued. In recent years the misgovernment of the Khedive Ismael had brought into its control France and Britain; then came the deposition of Ismael, the revolt under Arabi, the bombardment of Alexandria and the battle of Tel-el-Kebir. Since then Egypt has been occupied by Great Britain, who restored order, defeated the armies of the Mahdi, and turned Egyptian bankruptcy into prosperity. Lord Kitchener was the English hero of the wars with the Mahdi, and Lord Cromer the administrator who gave the Egyptian peasant a comfort unknown since the days of the Pharaohs. With prosperity came political agitation, and Germany, as has been seen, looked upon Egypt as fertile territory for German propaganda.  Intrigue having failed in Egypt, a Turkish force was directed against the Suez Canal. If that could be captured Great Britain could be cut off from India. An expeditionary army of about 65,000 men was gathered under the command of Djemal Pasha, the former Turkish Minister of Marine. He had been bitterly indignant at the seizure of the two Turkish dreadnaughts building in England, and was burning for revenge. But he found great difficulties before him. To reach the Canal it was necessary to cross a trackless desert, varying from 120 to 150 miles in width. Over this desert there were three routes. The first touched the Mediterranean coast at El-Arish and then went across the desert to El-Kantara on the Canal, twenty-five miles south of Port Said. On this route there were only a few wells, quite insufficient for an army. A second route ran from Akaba, on the Red Sea, across the Peninsula of Sinai to a point a little north of Suez. This was also badly supplied with wells. Between the two was the central route. Leaving the Mediterranean at El-Arish it ran up the valley called the Wady El-Arish to where that valley touched the second road. There was no railway, nor were these roads suitable for motor transports; for an army to move it would be necessary either to build a railway or to improve the roads. The best route for railway was the Wady El-Arish. The Suez Canal, moreover, can be easily defended. It is over two hundred feet wide, with banks rising to a height of forty feet. A railway runs along the whole Canal, and most of the ground to the east is flat, offering a good field of fire either to troops on the banks or to ships on the Canal.  A considerable force of British troops, under the command of Major-General Sir John Maxwell, were assigned for the protection of the Canal. About the end of October it was reported that 2,000 Bedouins were marching on the Canal, and on November 21st a skirmish took place between this force and some of the English troops in which the Bedouins were repelled. Nothing more was heard for more than two months, but on January 28, 1915, a small advance party from the Turkish army was beaten back east of El-Kantara. British airmen watched the desert well and kept the British army well informed of the Turkish movements. The Turks had found it impossible to convey their full force across the desert, and the forces which finally arrived seemed to have numbered only about twelve thousand men. The main attack was not developed until February 2d.  According to an account in the London Times, on that date, the enemy began to move toward the Ismailia Ferry. They met a reconnoitering party of Indian troops of all arms, and a desultory engagement ensued to which a violent sandstorm put a sudden end about three o\\'clock in the afternoon. The main attacking force pushed forward toward its destination after nightfall. From twenty-five to thirty galvanized iron pontoon boats, seven and a half meters in length, which had been dragged in carts across the desert, were hauled by hand toward the water. With one or two rafts made of kerosene tins in a wooden frame, all was ready for the attack. The first warning of the enemy\\'s approach was given by a sentry of a mountain battery who heard, to him, an unknown tongue across the water. The noise soon increased. It would seem that Mudjah Ideem--\"Holy Warriors\"--said to be mostly old Tripoli fighters, accompanied the pontoon section, and regulars of the Seventy-fifth regiment, for loud exultations, often in Arabic, of \"Brothers, die for the faith; we can die but once,\" betrayed the enthusiastic irregular.  The Egyptians waited until the Turks were pushing their boats into the water, then the Maxims attached to the battery suddenly spoke, and the guns opened at point-blank range at the men and boats crowded under the steep bank opposite them. Immediately a violent fire broke out on both sides of the Canal.  A little torpedo boat with a crew of thirteen, patrolling the Canal, dashed up and landed a party of four officers and men to the south of Tussum, who climbed up the eastern bank and found themselves in a Turkish trench, and escaped by a miracle with the news. Promptly the midget dashed in between the fires and enfiladed the eastern bank amid a hail of bullets, and destroyed several pontoon boats lying unlaunched on the bank. It continued to harass the enemy, though two officers and two men were wounded.  As the dark, cloudy night lightened toward dawn fresh forces went into action. The Turks, who occupied the outer, or day, line of the Tussum post, advanced, covered by artillery, against the Indian troops, holding the inner or night position, while an Arab regiment advanced against the Indian troop at the Serapeum post. The warships on the Canal and lake joined in the fray. The enemy brought some six batteries of field guns into action from the slopes west of Kataiba-el-kaeli. Shells admirably fused made fine practice at all the visible targets, but failed to find the battery above mentioned which with some help from a detachment of infantry, beat down the fire of the riflemen on the opposite bank and inflicted heavy losses on the hostile supports advancing toward the Canal.  Supported by land and naval artillery the Indian troops took the offensive, the Serapeum garrison, which had stopped the enemy three-quarters of a mile from the position, cleared its front, and the Tussum garrison, by a brilliant counter-attack, drove the enemy back. Two battalions of Anatolians of the Twenty-eighth regiment were thrown into the fight, but the artillery gave them no chance, and by 3.30 in the afternoon a third of the enemy, with the exception of a force that lay hid in bushy hollows on the east bank between the two posts, were in full retreat, leaving many dead, a large proportion of whom had been killed by shrapnel. Meanwhile the warships on the lake had been in action, a salvo from a battleship woke up Ismailia early, and crowds of soldiers and some civilians climbed every available sand hill to see what was doing, till the Turkish guns sent shells sufficiently near to convince them that it was safer to watch from cover.  At about eleven in the morning two six-inch shells hit the Hardinge near the southern entrance of the lake. They first damaged the funnel, and the second burst inboard. Pilot Carew, a gallant old merchant seaman, refused to go below when the firing opened and lost a leg. Nine others were wounded, one or two merchantmen were hit but no lives were lost. A British gunboat was struck. Then came a dramatic duel between the Turkish big gun, or guns, and a warship. The Turks fired just over, and then just short, at 9,000 yards. The warship sent in a salvo of more six-inch shells than had been fired that day.  Late in the afternoon of the 3d there was sniping from the east bank between Tussum and Serapeum, and a man was killed on the tops of a British battleship. Next morning the sniping was renewed and the Indian troops, moving out to search the ground, found several hundred of the enemy in the hollow previously mentioned. During the fighting some of the enemy, either by accident or design, held up their hands, while others fired on the Punjabis, who were advancing to take the surrender, and killed a British officer. A sharp fight with the cold steel followed, and a British officer killed a Turkish officer with a sword thrust in single combat. A body of a German officer with a white flag was afterward found here, but there is no proof that the white flag was used. Finally all the enemy were killed, captured or put to flight. With this the fighting ended, and the subsequent operations were confined to the rounding up of prisoners, and the capture of a considerable amount of military material left behind. The Turks, who departed with their guns and baggage during the night of the 3d, still seemed to be moving eastward.  So ended the battle of the Suez Canal.  Two more incidents in the Turkish campaign remain to be noticed. Report having come that the town of Akaba on the Red Sea was being used as a mine-laying station, H. M. S. Minerva visited the place, and found it occupied by soldiers under a German officer. The Minerva destroyed the fort and the barracks and the government buildings. Another British cruiser, with a detachment of Indian troops, captured the Turkish fort at Sheik Said, at the southern end of the Red Sea. And so for the time ended all Turkish movements against Great Britain. That such movements should have been possible seems hard to believe. For a century the British had been the friends and allies of the Turkish Government. In the Crimean War their armies had fought side by side with the Turkish troops against Russia. In the Russo-Turkish War Lord Beaconsfield, in the negotiations which preceded the treaty of Berlin, had saved for Turkey much of its territory. It was only the British influence and the fear of the British power which had prevented Russia from taking possession of Constantinople a half a century before. The English had always been popular in Turkey and there was every reason at the beginning of the war to believe that their popularity had not waned. There is reason to believe that the average Turk had little sympathy with the course of his government, and if a free expression of the popular will had been possible the Turkish army would never have been sent against either the Englishmen or the Frenchmen. But long years of German propaganda had done their work. The power of Enver Pasha was greater than that of the weakling Sultan and the war was forced upon the Turkish people by German tools and German bribes.    CHAPTER XII  RESCUE OF THE STARVING  The sufferings of Belgium during the German occupation were terrible, and attracted the attention and the sympathy of the whole world. To understand conditions it is necessary to know something of the economic situation. Since it had come under the protection of the Great Powers, Belgium had developed into one of the greatest manufacturing countries in the world. Nearly two million of her citizens were employed in the great industries, and one million two hundred thousand on the farms. She was peaceful, industrious and happy. But on account of the fact that more than one-half of her citizenship earned their living by daily labor she found it impossible to produce foodstuff enough for her own needs. Seventy-eight per cent of her breadstuffs had to be imported. From her own fields she could hardly supply her population for more than four months.  The war, and the German occupation, almost destroyed business. Mines, workshops, factories and mills were closed. Labor found itself without employment and consequently without wages. The banks would extend no credit. But even if there had been money enough it soon became apparent that the food supply was rapidly going. The German invasion had come when the crops were standing ripe upon the field. Those crops had not been reaped, but had been trampled under foot by the hated German.  One feature of Belgian industrial life should be understood. Hundreds of thousands of her workmen were employed each day in workshops at considerable distances from their own homes. In times of peace the morning and evening trains were always crowded with laborers going to and returning from their daily toil. One of the first things seized upon by the German officials was the railroads, and it was with great difficulty that anyone, not belonging to the German army, could obtain an opportunity to travel at all, and it was with still greater difficulty that supplies of food of any kind could be transported from place to place. Every village was cut off from its neighbor, every town from the next town. People were unable even to obtain news of the great political events which were occurring from day to day, and the food supply was automatically cut off.  But this was not the worst. One of the first moves of the German occupation was to quarter hundreds of thousands of troops upon their Belgian victims, and these troops must be fed even though the Belgian and his family were near starvation. Then followed the German seizure of what they called materials for war. General von Beseler in a despatch to the Kaiser, after the fall of Antwerp, speaks very plainly:   The war booty taken at Antwerp is enormous--at least five hundred cannon and huge quantities of ammunition, sanitation materials, high-power motor cars, locomotives, wagons, four million kilograms of wheat, large quantities of flour, coal and flax wool, the value of which is estimated at ten million marks, copper, silver, one armored train, several hospital trains, and quantities of fish.   The Germans proceeded to commandeer foodstuffs and raw materials of industry. Linseed oil, oil cakes, nitrates, animal and vegetable oils, petroleum and mineral oils, wool, copper, rubber, ivory, cocoa, rice, wine, beer, all were seized and sent home to the Fatherland. Moreover, cities and provinces were burdened with formidable war contributions. Brussels was obliged to pay ten million dollars, Antwerp ten million dollars, the province of Brabant, ninety millions of dollars, Namur and seventeen surrounding communes six million four hundred thousand dollars. Finally Governor von Bissing, on the 10th of December, 1914, issued the following decree:   A war contribution of the amount of eight million dollars to be paid monthly for one year is imposed upon the population of Belgium. The payment of these amounts is imposed upon the nine provinces which are regarded as joint debtors. The two first monthly payments are to be made by the 15th of January, 1915, at latest, and the following monthly payments by the tenth of each following month to the military chest of the Field Army of the General Imperial Government in Brussels. If the provinces are obliged to resort to the issue of stock with a view to procuring the necessary funds, the form and terms of these shares will be determined by the Commissary General for the banks in Belgium.  At a meeting of the Provincial Councils the vice-president declared: \"The Germans demand these $96,000,000 of the country without right and without reason. Are we to sanction this enormous war tax? If we listened only to our hearts, we should reply \\'No I ninety-six million times no! because our hearts would tell us we were a small, honest nation living happily by its free labor; we were a small, honest nation having faith in treaties and believing in honor; we were a nation unarmed, but full of confidence, when Germany suddenly hurled two million men upon our frontiers, the most brutal army that the world has ever seen, and said to us, \\'Betray the promise you have given. Let my armies go by, that I may crush France, and I will give you gold.\\' Belgium replied, \\'Keep your gold. I prefer to die, rather than live without honor.\\' The German army has, therefore, crushed our country in contempt of solemn treaties. \\'It is an injustice,\\' said the Chancellor of the German Empire. \\'The position of Germany has forced us to commit it, but we will repair the wrong we have done to Belgium by the passage of our armies.\\' They want to repair the injustice as follows: Belgium will pay Germany $96,000,000! Give this proposal your vote. When Galileo had discovered the fact that the earth moved around the sun, he was forced at the foot of the stake to abjure his error, but he murmured, \\'Nevertheless it moves.\\' Well, gentlemen, as I fear a still greater misfortune for my country I consent to the payment of the $96,000,000 and I cry \\'Nevertheless it moves.\\' Long live our country in spite of all.\"  At the end of a year von Bissing renewed this assessment, inserting in his decree the statement that the decree was based upon article forty-nine of The Hague Convention, relating to the laws and usages of war on land. This article reads as follows: \"If in addition to the taxes mentioned in the above article the occupant levies other moneyed contributions in the occupied territory, they shall only be applied to the needs of the army, or of the administration, of the territory in question.\" In the preceding article it says: \"If in the territory occupied the occupant collects the taxes, dues and tolls payable to the state, he shall do so as far as possible in accordance with the legal basis and assessment in force at the time, and shall in consequence be bound to defray the expenses of the administration of the occupied territories to the same extent as the National Government had been so bound.\"  The $96,000,000 per annum was more than six times the amount of the direct taxes formerly collected by the Belgian state, taxes which the German administration, moreover, collected in addition to the war assessment. It was five times as great as the ordinary expenditure of the Belgian War Department.   [Illustration: Map: Denmark on the North, Elbe River on the East, Switzerland on the South, Eastern England on the West.]   SCHLESWIG-HOLSTEIN AND ALSACE-LORRAINE ACQUISITIONS   But this was not all. In addition to the more or less legitimate German methods of plunder the whole country had been pillaged. In many towns systematic pillage began as soon as the Germans took possession. At Louvain the pillage began on the 27th of August, 1914, and lasted a week. In small bands the soldiers went from house to house, ransacked drawers and cupboards, broke open safes, and stole money, pictures, curios, silver, linen, clothing, wines, and food. Great loads of such plunder were packed on military baggage wagons and sent to Germany. The same conditions were reported from town after town. In many cases the houses were burnt to destroy the proof of extensive thefts.  Nor were these offenses committed only by the common soldiers. In many cases the officers themselves sent home great collections of plunder. Even the Royal Family were concerned in this disgraceful performance. After staying for a week in a chateau in the Liege District, His Imperial Highness, Prince Eitel Fritz and the Duke of Brunswick, had all the dresses which were found in a wardrobe sent back to Germany. This is said to be susceptible of absolute proof.  In addition to this form of plunder special pretexts were made use of to obtain money. At Arlon a telephone wire was broken, whereupon the town was given four hours to pay a fine of $20,000 in gold, in default of which one hundred houses would be sacked. When the payment was made forty-seven houses had already been plundered. Instance after instance could be given of similar unjustifiable and exorbitant fines.  Under treatment like this Belgium was brought in a short time into immediate sight of starvation. They made frantic appeals for help. First they appealed to the Germans, but the German authorities did nothing, though in individual cases German soldiers shared their army rations with the people. Then an appeal was made to Holland, but Holland was a nation much like Belgium. It did not raise food enough for itself, and was not sure that it could import enough for its own needs.  From all over Belgium appeals were sent from the various towns and villages to Brussels. But Brussels, too, was face to face with famine. To cope with famine there were many relief organizations in Belgium. Every little town had its relief committee, and in the larger cities strong branches of the Red Cross did what they could. Besides such secular organizations, there were many religious organizations, generally under the direction of the Roman Catholic Church.  In Brussels a strong volunteer relief organization was formed on September 5th under the patronage of the American and Spanish Ministers, Mr. Brand Whitlock and the Marquis of Villalobar. This committee, known as the Central Relief Committee, or more exactly La Comite Central de Secours et d\\'Alimentation pour l\\'Agglomeration bruxelloise, did wonderful work until the end of the war. But though there was plenty of organization there were great difficulties ahead.  In order to import food, credit had to be established abroad, permission had to be obtained to transport food stuffs into Belgium through the British blockade. Permission to use the railroads and canals of Belgium had to be obtained from Germany, and, most important of all, it had to be made certain that no food thus imported should be seized by the German troops.  Through the American and Spanish ministers permission was obtained from Governor-General Kolmar von der Goltz to import food, and the Governor-General also gave assurance that, \"Foodstuffs of all sorts imported by the committee to assist the civil population shall be reserved exclusively for the nourishment of the civil population of Belgium, and that consequently these foodstuffs shall be exempt from requisition on the part of the military authorities, and shall rest exclusively at the disposition of the committee.\"  With this assurance the Central Relief Committee sent Emil Francqui and Baron Lambert, members of their committee, together with Mr. Hugh Gibson, secretary of the American Legation, whose activities in behalf of Belgium attracted much favorable notice, to the city of London, to explain to the British Government the suffering that existed in Belgium, and to obtain permission to transport food through the British blockade. In the course of this work they appealed to the American Ambassador in England, Mr. Walter Hines Page, and were introduced by him to an American mining engineer named Herbert Clark Hoover, who had just become prominent as the chairman of a committee to assist Americans who had found themselves in Europe when the war broke out, and had been unable to secure funds.  Mr. Hoover took up the matter with great vigor, and organized an American committee under the patronage of the ministers of the United States and of Spain in London, Berlin, The Hague and Brussels, which committee obtained permission from the British Government to purchase and transport through the British blockade, to Rotterdam, Holland, cargoes of foodstuffs, to be ultimately transferred into Belgium and distributed by the Belgian Central Relief Committee under the direction of American citizens headed by Mr. Brand Whitlock.   [Illustration: Painting: Several ships and two airplanes.]   AN AIRPLANE CONVOY   Food ships successfully convoyed by seaplanes in clear weather when   submarines were easier to detect.   188  HISTORY OF THE WORLD WAR  [Illustration: Painting]   BRITISH LIGHT ARTILLERY GETTING IN ON THE GALLOP   Always the guns must follow closely in the wake of the infantry to   break up German counter attacks and hold the ground gained. Here a   detachment of the Royal Horse Artillery storms through a deserted   Flanders village, straining every nerve to save those few seconds that   may mean the saving or the loss of the new positions won.   The following brief notices, in connection with this committee appeared in the London Times:  October 24 1914.--A commission has been set up in London, under the title of The American Commission for Relief in Belgium. The Brussels committee reports feeding 300,000 daily.  November 4.--The Commission for Relief in Belgium yesterday issued their first weekly report, 3 London Wall Buildings. A cargo was received yesterday at Brussels just in time. Estimated monthly requirements, 60,000 tons grain, 15,000 tons maize, 3,000 tons rice and peas. Approved by the Spanish and American ministers, Brussels.  The personality of the various gentlemen who devoted themselves to Belgian relief is interesting, not only because of what they did, but because they are unusual men. The Spanish Minister, who bore the peculiar name of Marquis of Villalobar y O\\'Neill, had the appearance of an Irishman, as he was on the maternal side, and was a trained diplomat, with delightful manners and extraordinary strength of character. Another important aid in the Belgian relief work was the Mexican Charge d\\'Affaires Senor don German Bulle. Hugh Gibson, secretary of the American Legation, wittily described this gentleman as the \"representative of a country without a government to a government without a country.\" The businessman in the American Legation was this secretary. Mr. Gibson had the appearance of a typical Yankee, though he came from Indiana. He was about thirty years old, with dark eyes, crisp hair, and a keen face. He was noted for his wit as well as his courage. Many interesting stories are told of him. He had been often under fire, and he was full of stories of his exploits told in a witty and modest way.  The following incident shows something of his humor. Like most of the Americans in Belgium he was followed by spies. With one of these Gibson became on the most familiar terms, much to the spy\\'s disgust. One very rainy day, when Gibson was at the Legation, he discovered his pet spy standing under the dripping eaves of a neighboring house. Gibson picked up a raincoat and hurried over to the man.  \"Look here, old fellow,\" said he, \"I\\'m going to be in the Legation for three hours. You put on this coat and go home. Come back in three hours and I\\'ll let you watch me for the rest of the day.\"  Mr. Brand Whitlock, the American Minister, was a remarkable man. Before coming to Belgium he had become a distinguished man of letters. Beginning as a newspaper reporter in Chicago, he had studied law and been admitted to the Illinois Bar in 1894, and to the Bar of the State of Ohio in 1897. He had entered into politics, and been elected mayor of Toledo, Ohio, in 1905, again in 1907, 1909 and 1911. Meanwhile he had been writing novels, \"The Thirteenth District,\" \"The Turn of the Balance,\" \"The Fall Guy,\" and \"Forty Years of It.\" He had accepted the appointment of American Minister to Belgium with the idea that he would find leisure for other literary work, but the outbreak of the war affected him deeply. A man of a sympathetic character who had lived all his life in an amiable atmosphere, had been a member of prison reform associations and charitable societies, he now found himself surrounded by a storm of horrors. Day by day he had to see the distress and suffering of thousands of people. He threw himself at once into the work of relief. His health was not strong and he always looked tired and worn. He was the scholarly type of man, the kind who would be happy in a library, or in the atmosphere of a college, but he rose to the emergency.  The American Legation became the one staple point around which the starving and suffering population could rally. Belgians will never forget what he did in those days. On Washington\\'s Birthday they filed before the door of the American Legation at Number 74 Rue de Treves, men, women and children of all classes; some in furs, some in the garments of the poor; noblemen, scholars, workmen, artists, shopkeepers and peasants to leave their visiting cards, some engraved, some printed and some written on pieces of paper, in tribute to Mr. Whitlock and the nation which he represented.  But the man whose name stands cut above all others as one of the biggest figures in connection with the work of relief was Mr. Herbert C. Hoover. Mr. Hoover came of Quaker stock. He was born at West Branch, Iowa, in 1874, graduated from Leland Stanford University in 1895, specialized in mining engineering, and spent several years in mining in the United States and in Australia. He married Miss Lou Henry, of Monterey, California, in 1899, and with his bride went to China as chief engineer of the Chinese Imperial Bureau of Mines. He aided in the defense of Tientsin during the Boxer Rebellion. After that he continued engineering work in China until 1902, when he became a partner of the firm of Bewick, Moreing & Co., mine operators, of London, and was consulting engineer for more than fifty mining companies. He looked extremely youthful; smooth shaven, with a straight nose, and a strong mouth and chin. To him, more than anyone else, was due the creation and the success of the Commission for Relief in Belgium. The splendid organization which saved from so much suffering more than seven million non-combatants in Belgium and two million in Northern France, was his achievement.  A good story is told in the Outlook of September 8, 1915, which illustrates his methods. It seems that before the commission was fairly on its feet, there came a day when it was a case of snarling things in red tape and letting Belgium starve, or getting food shipped and letting governments howl. Hoover naturally chose the latter.  When the last bag had been stowed and the hatches were battened down (writes Mr. Lewis R. Freeman, who tells the story), Hoover went in person to the one Cabinet Minister able to arrange for the only things he could not provide for himself--clearance papers.  \"If I do not get four cargoes of food to Belgium by the end of the week,\" he said bluntly, \"thousands are going to die from starvation, and many more may be shot in food riots.\"  \"Out of the question,\" said the distinguished Minister; \"there is no time, in the first place, and if there was, there are no good wagons to be spared by the railways, no dock hands, and no steamers. Moreover, the Channel is closed for a week to merchant vessels, while troops are being transferred to the Continent.\"  \"I have managed to get all these things,\" Hoover replied quietly, \"and am now through with them all, except the steamers. This wire tells me that these are now loaded and ready to sail, and I have come to have you arrange for their clearance.\"  The great man gasped. \"There have been--there are even now--men in the Tower for less than you have done!\" he ejaculated. \"If it was for anything but Belgium Relief--if it was anybody but you, young man--I should hate to think of what might happen. As it is--er--I suppose there is nothing to do but congratulate you on a jolly clever coup. I\\'ll see about the clearance at once.\"  Mr. Lloyd George tells the following story: It seems that the Commission on Belgian Relief was attempting to simplify its work by arranging for an extension of exchange facilities on Brussels. Mr. Lloyd George, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, sent for Hoover. What happened is told in Mr. George\\'s words:  \"\\'Mr. Hoover,\\' I said, \\'I find I am quite unable to grant your request in the matter of Belgian exchange, and I have asked you to come here that I might explain why.\\'  \"Without waiting for me to go on, my boyish-looking caller began speaking. For fifteen minutes he spoke without a break--just about the clearest expository utterance I have ever heard on any subject. He used not a word too much, nor yet a word too few. By the time he had finished I had come to realize, not only the importance of his contentions, but, what was more to the point, the practicability of granting his request. So I did the only thing possible under the circumstance, told him I had never understood the question before, thanked him for helping me to understand, and saw to it that things were arranged as he wanted them.\"  On April 10, 1915, a submarine torpedoed one of the food ships chartered by the commission. A week later a German hydro-airplane tried to drop bombs on the deck of another commission ship. So Hoover paid a flying visit to Berlin. He was at once assured that no more incidents of the sort would occur.  \"Thanks,\" said Hoover. \"Your Excellency, have you heard the story of the man who was nipped by a bad-tempered dog? He went to the owner to have the dog muzzled. \\'But the dog won\\'t bite you,\\' insisted the owner. \\'You know he won\\'t bite me, and I know he won\\'t bite me,\\' said the injured party doubtfully, \\'but the question is, does the dog know?\\'\"  \"Herr Hoover,\" said the high official, \"pardon me if I leave you for a moment. I am going at once to \\'let the dog know.\\'\"  This story, which is told by Mr. Edward Eyre Hunt in his delightful book about Belgium, \"War Bread,\" may be apocryphal, but it illustrates well Hoover\\'s habit of getting exactly what he wants.  When Mr. Hoover accepted the chairmanship of the Commission for Relief in Belgium he established his headquarters at 3 London Wall Buildings, London, England, and marshaled a small legion of fellow Americans, business men, sanitary experts, doctors and social workers, who, as unpaid volunteers, set about the great task of feeding the people of Belgium and Northern France. The commission soon became a great institution, recognized by all governments, receiving contributions from all parts of the earth, with its own ships in every big port, and in the eyes of the Belgians and French, who received their daily bread through its agency, a monument of what Americans could do in social organization and business efficiency, for Americans furnished the entire personnel of the commission from the beginning.  The commission was a distinct organization from the Belgian National Committee, through and with which it worked in Belgium itself. Its functions were those of direction, and supervision of all matters that had to be dealt with outside Belgium. In the occupied territories it had the help of thousands of Belgian and French workers, many of them women.   The commission did not depend, according to Mr. Hoover, on anyone of its American members for leadership. Anyone of them could at any time take charge and carry on the work. \"Honold, Poland, Gregory, Brown, Kellogg, Lucey, White, Hunsiker, Connet, and many others who, at various periods, have given of their great ability and experience in administration could do it.\" At the same time it was admitted that the commission would never have been so successful if Belgium had not already had in existence a well-developed communal system. The base of the commission\\'s organization was a committee in every commune or municipality.  \"You can have no idea what a great blessing it was in Belgium and Northern France to have the small and intimate divisions which exist under the communal system,\" said Mr. Hoover. \"It is the whole unit of life, and a political entity much more developed than in America. It has been not only the basis of our relief organization, but the salvation of the people.\"  Altogether there were four thousand communal committees linked up in larger groups under district and provincial committees, which in turn came under the Belgian National Committee. Contributions were received from all over the world, but the greater part from the British and French governments.  When Mr. Hoover began his work he appealed to the people of the United States, but the American response to the appeal was sadly disappointing. During his stay in America, in the early part of 1917, Mr. Hoover expressed himself on the subject of his own country\\'s niggardliness, pointing out at the same time that the chief profits made out of providing food for Belgium had gone into American pockets. Out of the two hundred and fifty millions of dollars spent by the commission at that time, one hundred and fifty millions had been used in the United States to purchase supplies and on these orders America had made a war profit of at least thirty million dollars. Yet in those two years the American people had contributed only nine million dollars!  Mr. Hoover declared: \"Thousands of contributions have come to us from devoted people all over the United States, but the truth is that, with the exception of a few large gifts, American contributions have been little rills of charity of the poor toward the poor. Everywhere abroad America has been getting the credit for keeping alight the lamp of humanity, but what are the facts? America\\'s contributions have been pitifully inadequate and, do not forget it, other peoples have begun to take stock of us. We have been getting all the credit. Have we deserved it? We lay claim to idealism, to devotion to duty and to great benevolence, but now the acid test is being applied to us. This has a wider import than mere figures. Time and time again, when the door to Belgium threatened to close, we have defended its portals by the assertion that this was an American enterprise; that the sensibilities of the American people would be wounded beyond measure, would be outraged, if this work were interfered with. Our moral strength has been based upon this assertion. I believe it is true, but it is difficult in the face of the figures to carry conviction. And in the last six or eight months time and again we have felt our influence slip from under us.\"  The statement that Germans had taken food intended for the Belgians was disposed of by Mr. Hoover in a speech in New York City. \"We are satisfied,\" he said, \"that the German army has never eaten one-tenth of one per cent of the food provided. The Allied governments never would have supplied us with two hundred million dollars if we were supplying the German army. If the Germans had absorbed any considerable quantity of this food the population of Belgium would not be alive today.\"  The plan of operation of the Belgian Commission needs some description. Besides the headquarters in London there was an office in Brussels, and, as Rotterdam was the port of entry for all Belgian supplies, a transshipping office for commission goods was opened in that city. The office building was at 98 Haringvliet, formerly the residence of a Dutch merchant prince.  Captain J. F. Lucey, the first Rotterdam director, sat in a roomy office on the second floor overlooking the Meuse. From his windows he could see the commission barges as they left for Belgium, their huge canvas flags bearing the inscription \"Belgian Relief Committee.\" He was a nervous, big, beardless American, a volunteer who had left his business to organize and direct a great transshipping office in an alien land for an alien people.  Out of nothing he created a large staff of clerks, wrung from the Dutch Government special permits, loaded the immense cargoes received from England into canal boats, obtained passports for cargoes and crews, and shipped the foodstuffs consigned personally to Mr. Brand Whitlock.  Something of what was done at this point may be understood from a reference in the first annual report of the commission published October 31, 1915:   The chartering and management of an entire fleet of vessels, together with agency control practically throughout the world, has been carried out for the commission quite free of the usual charges by large transportation firms who offered these concessions in the cause of humanity. Banks generally have given their exchange services and have paid the full rate of interest on deposits. Insurance has been facilitated by the British Government Insurance Commissioners, and the firms who fixed the insurance have subscribed the equivalent of their fees. Harbor dues and port charges have been remitted at many points and stevedoring firms have made important concessions in rates and have afforded other generous services. In Holland, exemption from harbor dues and telegraph tolls has been granted and rail transport into Belgium provided free of charge. The total value of these Dutch concessions is estimated at 147,824 guilders. The German military authorities in Belgium have abolished custom and canal dues on all commission imports, have reduced railway rates one-half and on canals and railways they give right of way to commission foodstuffs wherever there is need.   By mid-November gift ships from the United States were on their way to Rotterdam, but the Canadian province of Nova Scotia was first in the transatlantic race.  One of the most thrilling experiences of the first year\\'s work was the coming of the Christmas ship, a steamer full of Christmas gifts presented by the children of America to the children of war-ridden Belgium. The children knew all about it long before the ship arrived in Rotterdam. St. Nicholas\\' day had brought them few presents. They were hungry for friendliness, and the thought of getting gifts from children across the sea filled them with joy.  Many difficulties arose, which delayed the distribution of these gifts. The Germans insisted that every package should be opened and every scrap of writing taken out before the gifts were sent into Belgium. This was a tremendous task, for notes written by American children were tucked away into all sorts of impossible places.  Three motor boats made an attempt to carry these gifts into Belgium by Christmas day. They carried boxes of clothing, outfits for babies, blankets, caps, bonnets, cloaks, shoes of every description, babies\\' boots, candy, fish, striped candy canes, chocolates and mountains of nuts, nuts such as the Belgians had never seen in their lives before: pecans, hickory nuts, American walnuts, and peanuts galore. There were scores of dolls, French bisques, smiling pleasantly, pop-eyed rag dolls, old darky mammy dolls, and Santa Clauses, teddy bears, picture books, fairy books and story books.  One child had written on the cover of her book: \"Father says I ought to send you my best picture book, but I think that this one will do.\"  These gifts made the American aid to Belgium a thousand times more intimate and real, and never after that was American help thought of in other terms than those of burning gratitude. Among these gifts were hundreds of American flags, which soon became familiar to all Belgium.  The commission automobiles bore the flag, and the children would recognize the Stars and Stripes and wave and cheer as it went by. Thousands upon thousands of gifts to the Belgian people followed the Christmas ship. All, or a great part, of the cargoes of one hundred and two ships consisted of gift goods from America and indeed from all parts of the world, and the Belgians sent back a flood of acknowledgments and thousands of beautiful souvenirs. Some of the most touching remembrances came from the children. Every child in the town of Tamise, for example, wrote a letter to America.  One addressed to the President of the United States reads as follows:   Highly Honored Mr. President: Although I am still very young I feel already that feeling of thankfulness which we, as Belgians, owe to you, Highly Honored Mr. President, because you have come to our help in these dreary times. Without your help there would certainly have been thousands of war victims, and so, Noble Sir, I pray that God will bless you and all the noble American people. That is the wish of all the Belgian folk.   On New Year\\'s day Cardinal Mercier, Archbishop of Malines, issued his famous pastoral:   Belgium gave her word of honor to defend her independence. She has kept her word. The other powers had agreed to protect and to respect Belgium\\'s neutrality. Germany has broken her word, England has been faithful to it. These are the facts. I consider it an obligation of my pastoral charge to define to you your conscientious duties toward the power which has invaded our soil, and which for the moment occupies the greater part of it. This power has no authority, and, therefore, in the depth of your heart, you should render it neither esteem, nor attachment, nor respect. The only legitimate power in Belgium is that which belongs to our King, to his government, to the representatives of the nation; that alone is authority for us; that alone has a right to our heart\\'s affection and to our submission.   Cardinal Mercier was called the bravest man in Belgium. Six feet five in height, a thin, scholarly face, with grayish white hair, and a forehead so white that one feels one looks on the naked bone, he presented the appearance of some medieval ascetic. But there was a humorous look about his mouth, and an expression of sympathy and comprehension which gave the effect of a keenly intelligent, as well as gentle, leader of the nation.  At the beginning of the war the Roman Catholic party was divided. Some of its leaders were opposed to resistance to the invaders. Many priests fled before the German armies. But the pastoral letter of Cardinal Mercier restored to the Church its old leadership. In him conquered Belgium had found a voice.  On New Year\\'s Sunday, 1915, every priest at the Mass read out the Cardinal\\'s ringing challenge. There were German soldiers in the churches, but no word of the letter had been allowed to reach the ears of the authorities, and the Germans were taken completely by surprise. Immediately orders came from headquarters prohibiting further circulation of the letter, and ordering that every copy should be surrendered to the authorities. Soldiers at the bayonet\\'s point extorted the letter from the priests, and those who had read it were put under arrest. Yet, somehow, copies of the letter were circulated throughout Belgium, and every Belgian took new heart.  As far as the Cardinal was concerned German action was a very delicate matter. They could not arrest and imprison so great a dignitary of the Church for fear of the effect, not only upon the Catholics of the outer world, but on the Catholics in their own empire. An officer was sent to the Cardinal to demand that the letter be recalled. The Cardinal refused. He was then notified that it was desired that he remain in his palace for the present. His confinement lasted only for a day.  The Americans who were in Belgium as representatives of the Relief Commission had two duties. First, to see that the Germans did not seize any of the food supplies, and second, to see that every Belgian who was in need should receive his daily bread. The ration assigned to each Belgian was 250 grams of bread per day. This seems rather small, but the figure was established by Horace Fletcher, the American food expert, who was one of the members of the commission.  Mr. Fletcher also prepared a pamphlet on food values, which gave recipes for American dishes which were up to that time unknown to the Belgians. He soon got not only the American but the Belgian committeemen talking of calories with great familiarity.  Some of the foods sent from America were at first almost useless to the Belgians. They did not know how to cook cornmeal and oatmeal, and some of the famished peasants used them as feed for chickens. Teachers had to be sent out through the villages to give instructions.  A great deal of difficulty developed in connection with the bread. The supply of white flour was limited; wheat had to be imported, and milled in Belgium. It was milled so as to contain all the bran except ten per cent, but in some places ten or fifteen per cent of cornmeal was added to the flour, not only to enable the commission to provide the necessary ration, but also to keep down the price. As a result the price of bread was always lower in Belgium than in London, Paris or New York.  Much less trouble occurred in connection with the distribution of bread and soup from the soup kitchens. In Antwerp thirty-five thousand men were fed daily at these places. At first it often occurred that soup could be had, but no bread. The ration of soup and bread given in the kitchens cost about ten cents a day. There were four varieties of soup, pea, bean, vegetable and bouillon, and it was of excellent quality. Every person carried a card with blank spaces for the date of the deliveries of soup. There were several milk kitchens maintained for the children, and several restaurants where persons with money might obtain their food.  It was necessary not only to fight starvation in Belgium but also disease. There were epidemics of typhoid and black measles. The Rockefeller Foundation established a station in Rotterdam called the Rockefeller Foundation War Relief Commission, and some of the women among its workers acted as volunteer health officers. People were inoculated against typhoid, and the sources of infection traced and destroyed. Another form of relief work was providing labor for the unemployed. A plan of relief was drawn up and it was arranged that a large portion of them should be employed by the communal organizations, in public works, such as draining, ditching, constructing embankments and building sewers. The National Committee paid nine-tenths of the wages, the commune paying the other tenth. The first enrolment of unemployed amounted to more than 760,000 names, and nearly as many persons were dependent upon these workers.  Providing employment for these led to certain complications. The Germans had been able up to this time to secure a certain amount of labor from the Belgians. Now the Belgian could refuse to work for the German, and a great deal of tact was necessary to prevent trouble. As time went on the relief work of the Commission was extended into the north of France, where a population of more than 2,000,000 was within the German zone. The work was handled in the same way, with the same guarantees from Germany.  In conclusion a word may be said of the effect of all this suffering upon the Belgian people, and let a Belgian speak, who knew his country well and had traveled it over, going on foot, as he says, or by tram, from town to town, from village to village:  \"I have seen and spoken with hundreds of men of all classes and all parts of the country, and all these people, taken singly or united in groups, display a very definite frame of mind. To describe this new psychology we must record the incontestably closer union which has been formed between the political sections of the country. There are no longer any political parties, there are Belgians in Belgium, and that is all; Belgians better acquainted with their country, feeling for it an impulse of passionate tenderness such as a child might feel who saw his mother suffering for the first time, and on his account. Walloons and Flemings, Catholics and Liberals or Socialists, all are more and more frankly united in all that concerns the national life and decisions for the future.  \"By uniting the whole nation and its army, by shedding the blood of all our Belgians in every corner of the country, by forcing all hearts, all families, to follow with anguish the movement of those soldiers who fought from Liege to Namur, from Wavre to Antwerp or the Oise, the war has suddenly imposed wider horizons upon all, has inspired all minds with noble and ardent passions, has compelled the good will of all to combine and act in concert in order to defend the common interests.  \"Of these profoundly tried minds, of these wonderful energies now employed for the first time, of these atrocious sufferings which have brought all hearts into closer contact, a new Belgium is born, a greater, more generous, more ideal Belgium.\"    CHAPTER XIII  BRITANNIA RULES THE WAVES  The month of October, 1914, contained no important naval contests. On the 15th, the old British cruiser Hawke was torpedoed in the North Sea and nearly five hundred men were lost. On the other hand, on the 17th of October, the light cruiser Undaunted, accompanied by the destroyers, Lance, Legion and Loyal, sank four German destroyers off the Dutch coast. But the opening of November turned the interest of the navy to the Southern Pacific. When the war began Admiral von Spee, with the German Pacific squadron, was at Kiaochau in command of seven vessels. Among these was the Emden, whose adventurous career has been already described. Another, the Karlsruhe, became a privateer in the South Atlantic.  Early in August von Spee set sail from Kiaochau with two armored cruisers, the Gneisenau and the Scharnhorst and three light cruisers, the Dresden, Leipzig and Nurmberg. These ships were comparatively new, well armed, and of considerable speed. They set off for the great trade highways to destroy, as far as possible, British commerce. Their route led them to the western coast of South America, and arrangements were made so that they were coaled and provisioned from bases in some of the South American states which permitted a slack observance of the laws respecting the duties of neutrals.  A small British squadron had been detailed to protect British commerce in this part of the world. It was commanded by Rear Admiral Sir Christopher Cradock, a distinguished and popular sailor, who had under his command one twelve-year-old battleship, the Canopus, two armored cruisers, the Good Hope and the Monmouth, the light cruiser Glasgow, and an armed liner, the Otranto. None of these vessels had either great speed or heavy armament. The equipment of the Canopus, indeed, was obsolete. Admiral Cradock\\'s squadron arrived at Halifax on August 14th, thence sailed to Bermuda, then on past Venezuela and Brazil around the Horn. It visited the Falkland Islands, and by the third week of October was on the coast of Chile. The Canopus had dropped behind for repairs, and though reinforcements were expected, they had not yet arrived.  One officer wrote, on the 12th of October, \"From now till the end of the month is the critical time, as it will decide whether we shall have to fight a superior German force from the Pacific before we can get reinforcements from home or the Mediterranean. We feel that the admiralty ought to have a better force here, but we shall fight cheerfully whatever odds we have to face.\"  Admiral Cradock knew well that his enemy was superior in force. From Coronel, where he sent off some cables, he went north on the first of November, and about four o\\'clock in the afternoon the Glasgow sighted the enemy. The two big German armored cruisers were leading the way, and two light cruisers were following close. The German cruiser Leipzig does not seem to have been in company. The British squadron was led by the Good Hope, with the Monmouth, Glasgow and Otranto following in order. It was a beautiful spectacle. The sun was setting in the wonderful glory which one sees in the Pacific, and the British ships, west of the German, must have appeared to them in brilliant colors. On the east were the snowy peaks of the Andes. Half a gale was blowing and the two squadrons moved south at great speed. About seven o\\'clock they were about seven miles apart and the Scharnhorst, which was leading the German fleet, opened fire. At this time the Germans were shaded by the inshore twilight, but the British ships must have showed up plainly in the afterglow. The enemy fired with great accuracy. Shell after shell hit the Good Hope and the Monmouth, but the bad light and inferior guns saved the German ships from much damage. The Good Hope was set on fire and at 7.50 exploded and sank. The Monmouth was also on fire, and turned away to the western sea. The Glasgow had escaped so far, but the whole German squadron bore down upon her. She turned and fled and by nine o\\'clock was out of sight of the enemy. The Otranto, only an armed liner, had disappeared early in the fight. On the following day the Glasgow worked around to the south, and joined the Canopus, and the two proceeded to the Straits of the Magellan. The account of this battle by the German Admiral von Spee is of especial interest:   \"Wind and swell were head on, and the vessels had heavy going, especially the small cruisers on both sides. Observation and distance estimation were under a severe handicap because of the seas which washed over the bridges. The swell was so great that it obscured the aim of the gunners at the six-inch guns on the middle deck, who could not see the sterns of the enemy ships at all, and the bows but seldom. At 6.20 P. M., at a distance of 13,400 yards, I turned one point toward the enemy, and at 6.34 opened fire at a distance of 11,260 yards. The guns of both our armored cruisers were effective, and at 6.39 already we could note the first hit on the Good Hope. I at once resumed a parallel course, instead of bearing slightly toward the enemy. The English opened their fire at this time. I assume that the heavy sea made more trouble for them than it did for us. Their two armored cruisers remained covered by our fire, while they, so far as could be determined, hit the Scharnhorst but twice, and the Gneisenau only four times. At 6.53, when 6,500 yards apart, I ordered a course one point away from the enemy. They were firing more slowly at this time, while we were able to count numerous hits. We could see, among other things, that the top of the Monmouth\\'s forward turret had been shot away, and that a violent fire was burning in the turret. The Scharnhorst, it is thought, hit the Good Hope about thirty-five times. In spite of our altered course the English changed theirs sufficiently so that the distance between us shrunk to 5,300 yards. There was reason to suspect that the enemy despaired of using his artillery effectively, and was maneuvering for a torpedo attack.  \"The position of the moon, which had risen at six o\\'clock, was favorable to this move. Accordingly I gradually opened up further distances between the squadrons by another deflection of the leading ship, at 7.45. In the meantime it had grown dark. The range finders on the Scharnhorst used the fire on the Monmouth as a guide for a time, though eventually all range finding, aiming and observations became so inexact that fire was stopped at 7.26. At 7.23 a column of fire from an explosion was noticed between the stacks of the Good Hope. The Monmouth apparently stopped firing at 7.20. The small cruisers, including the Nuremburg, received by wireless at 7.30 the order to follow the enemy and to attack his ships with torpedoes. Vision was somewhat obscured at this time by a rain squall. The light cruisers were not able to find the Good Hope, but the Nuremburg encountered the Monmouth and at 8.58 was able, by shots at closest range, to capsize her, without a single shot being fired in return. Rescue work in the heavy sea was not to be thought of, especially as the Nuremburg immediately afterward believed she had sighted the smoke of another ship and had to prepare for another attack. The small cruisers had neither losses nor damage in the battle. On the Gneisenau there were two men slightly wounded. The crews of the ships went into the fight with enthusiasm, everyone did his duty, and played his part in the victory.\"   Little criticism can be made of the tactics used by Vice-Admiral Spee. He appears to have maneuvered so as to secure the advantage of light, wind and sea. He also seems to have suited himself as regards the range.  Admiral Cradock was much criticised for joining battle with his little fleet against such odds, but he followed the glorious traditions of the English navy. He, and 1,650 officers and men, were lost, and the news was hailed as a great German victory. But the British admiralty were thoroughly roused. Rear-Admiral Sir Frederick Doveton Sturdee, chief of the war staff, proceeded at once with a squadron to the South Atlantic. With him were two battle cruisers, the Invincible and the Inflexible, three armored cruisers, the Carnovan, the Kent and the Cornwall. His fleet was joined by the light cruiser Bristol and the armed liner Macedonia. The Glasgow, fresh from her rough experience, was found in the South Atlantic. Admiral Sturdee then laid his plans to come in touch with the victorious German squadron. A wireless message was sent to the Canopus, bidding her proceed to Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands. This message was intercepted by the Germans, as was intended.   [Illustration: Photograph]   Copyright International News Service   THE SINKING OF THE GERMAN CRUISER \"BLUECHER\"   This dramatic photograph from the great North Sea Battle in 1915 shows   the stricken ship just as she turned turtle and was about to sink.   Officers and men can be seen swarming like ants on the upper side of   the hull. Others, who either fell or preferred to take their chance in   the sea, are shown swimming away from the wreck.   [Illustration: Painting]   GERMANY BRINGS THE WAR TO EAST COAST TOWNS OF ENGLAND   By raids with light cruisers on the coast towns, and Zeppelins and   airplanes further inland, Germany sought to frighten the British   populace. At Hartlepool, where this scene was enacted, several   civilians, some of them women and children, were killed by bursting   shells of the raiders.   Admiral von Spee, fearing the Japanese fleet, was already headed for Cape Horn. He thought that the Canopus could be easily captured at Port Stanley, and he started at once to that port. Admiral Sturdee\\'s expedition had been kept profoundly secret. On December 7th the British squadron arrived at Port Stanley, and spent the day coaling. The Canopus, the Glasgow and the Bristol were in the inner harbor, while the remaining vessels lay outside. On December 8th, Admiral von Spee arrived from the direction of Cape Horn. The battle that followed is thoroughly described in the report of Vice-Admiral Sturdee from which the following extracts have been made:   \"At 8 A. M., Tuesday, December 8th, a signal was received from the signal station on shore. \\'A four-funnel and two-funnel man-of-war in sight from Sapper Hill steering north.\\' The Kent was at once ordered to weigh anchor, and a general signal was made to raise steam for full speed. At 8.20 the signal service station reported another column of smoke in sight, and at 8.47 the Canopus reported that the first two ships were eight miles off, and that the smoke reported at 8.20 appeared to be the smoke of two ships about twenty miles off. At 9.20 A. M. the two leading ships of the enemy, the Gneisenau and Nuremburg, with guns trained on the wireless station, came within range of the Canopus, which opened fire at them across the lowland at a range of 11,000 yards. The enemy at once hoisted their colors, and turned away. A few minutes later the two cruisers altered course to port, as though to close the Kent at the entrance to the harbor. But at about this time it seems that the Invincible and Inflexible were seen over the land, and the enemy at once altered course, and increased speed to join their consorts. At 9.45 A. M. the squadron weighed anchor and proceeded out of the harbor, the Carnovan leading. On passing Cape Pembroke light, the five ships of the enemy appeared clearly in sight to the southeast, hull down. The visibility was at its maximum, the sea was calm, with a bright sun, a clear sky, and a light breeze from the northwest. At 10.20 the signal for a general chase was made. At this time the enemy\\'s funnels and bridges showed just above the horizon. Information was received from the Bristol at 11.27 that three enemy ships had appeared off Port Pleasant, probably colliers or transports. The Bristol was therefore directed to take the Macedonia under orders and destroy transports.  \"The enemy were still maintaining their distance, and I decided at 12.20 P. M. to attack, with the two battle cruisers and the Glasgow. At 12.47 P. M. the signal to \\'Open fire and engage the enemy\\' was made. The Inflexible opened fire at 12.55 P. M. at the right-hand ship of the enemy, and a few minutes later the Invincible opened fire at the same ship. The deliberate fire became too threatening, and when a shell fell close alongside her at 1.20 p. m. she, the Leipsig, turned away, with the Nuremburg and Dresden, to the southwest. These light cruisers were at once followed by the Kent, Glasgow and Cornwall.  \"The action finally developed into three separate encounters. First, the action with the armored cruisers. The fire of the battle cruisers was directed on the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau. The effect of this was quickly seen, when, with the Scharnhorst leading, they turned about seven points to port, and opened fire. Shortly afterwards the battle cruisers were ordered to turn together with the Invincible leading. The enemy then turned about ten points to starboard, and a second chase ensued until, at 2.45, the battle cruisers again opened fire. This caused the enemy to turn into line ahead to port and open fire. The Scharnhorst caught fire forward, but not seriously, and her fire slackened perceptibly. The Gneisenau was badly hit by the Inflexible.  \"At 3.30 P. M. the Scharnhorst turned about ten points to starboard, her fire had slackened perceptibly, and one shell had shot away her third funnel. Some guns were not firing, and it would appear that the turn was dictated by a desire to bring her starboard guns into action. The effect of the fire on the Scharnhorst became more and more apparent in consequence of smoke from fires and also escaping steam. At times a shell would cause a large hole to appear in her side, through which could be seen a dull, red glow of flame.  \"At 4.04 P. M. the Scharnhorst, whose flag remained flying to the last, suddenly listed heavily to port, and within a minute it became clear that she was a doomed ship, for the list increased very rapidly until she lay on her beam ends. At 4.17 P. M. she disappeared. The Gneisenau passed on the far side of her late flagship, and continued a determined, but ineffectual, effort to fight the two battle cruisers. At 5.08 P. M. the forward funnel was knocked over, and remained resting against the second funnel. She was evidently in serious straits, and her fire slackened very much.  \"At 5.15 P. M. one of the Gneisenau\\'s shells struck the Invincible. This was her last effective effort. At 5.30 P. M. she turned toward the flagship with a heavy list to starboard, and appeared to stop, the steam pouring from her escape pipes, and smoke from shell and fires rising everywhere. About this time I ordered the signal \\'Cease fire,\\' but before it was hoisted, the Gneisenau opened fire again, and continued to fire from time to time with a single gun. At 5.40 P. M. the three ships closed in on the Gneisenau, and at this time the flag flying at her fore truck, was apparently hauled down, but the flag at the peak continued flying. At 5.50 \\'Cease fire\\' was made. At 6 P. M. the Gneisenau keeled over very suddenly, showing the men gathered on her decks, and then walking on her side as she lay for a minute on her beam ends before sinking.  \"The prisoners of war from the Gneisenau report that by the time the ammunition was expended some six hundred men had been killed and wounded. When the ship capsized and sank there were probably some two hundred unwounded survivors in the water, but, owing to the shock of the cold water, many were drowned within sight of the boats and ships. Every effort was made to save life as quickly as possible, both by boats and from the ships. Life buoys were thrown and ropes lowered, but only a portion could be rescued. The Invincible alone rescued a hundred and eight men, fourteen of whom were found to be dead after being brought on board. These men were buried at sea the following day, with full military honors.  \"Second, action with the light cruisers. About one P. M. when the Scharnhorst and the Gneisenau turned to port to engage the Invincible and the Inflexible, the enemy\\'s light cruisers turned to starboard to escape. The Dresden was leading, and the Nuremburg and Leipzig followed on each quarter. In accordance with my instructions, the Glasgow, Kent and Cornwall at once went in chase of these ships. The Glasgow drew well ahead of the Cornwall and Kent, and at 3 P. M. shots were exchanged with the Leipzig at 12,000 yards. The Glasgow\\'s object was to endeavor to outrange the Leipzig, and thus cause her to alter course and give the Cornwall and Kent a chance of coming into action. At 4.17 P. M. the Cornwall opened fire also on the Leipzig; at 7.17 P. M. the Leipzig was on fire fore and aft, and the Cornwall and Glasgow ceased fire. The Leipzig turned over on her port side and disappeared at 9 P. M. Seven officers and eleven men were saved. At 3.36 P. M. the Cornwall ordered the Kent to engage the Nuremburg, the nearest cruiser to her. At 6.35 P. M. the Nuremburg was on fire forward, and ceased firing. The Kent also ceased firing, then, as the colors were still observed to be flying on the Nuremburg, the Kent opened fire again. Fire was finally stopped five minutes later, on the colors being hauled down, and every preparation was made to save life. The Nuremburg sank at 7.27, and as she sank a group of men were waving the German ensign attached to a staff.  \"Twelve men were rescued, but only seven survived. The Kent had four killed and twelve wounded, mostly caused by one shell. During the time the three cruisers were engaged with the Nuremburg and Leipzig, the Dresden, which was beyond her consorts, effected her escape, owing to her superior speed. The Glasgow was the only cruiser with sufficient speed to have had any chance of success, however she was fully employed in engaging the Leipzig for over an hour before either the Cornwall or Kent could come up and get within range. During this time the Dresden was able to increase her distance and get out of sight. Three, Action with the enemy\\'s transports. H.M.S. Macedonia reports that only two ships, the steamships Baden and Santa Isabel, were present. Both ships were sunk after removal of the crews.\"   Thus was annihilated the last squadron belonging to Germany outside the North Sea. The defeat of Cradock had been avenged. The British losses were very small, considering the length of the fight and the desperate efforts of the German fleet. Only one ship of the German squadron was able to escape, and this on account of her great speed. The German sailors went down with colors flying. They died as Cradock\\'s men had died.  The naval war now entered upon a new phase. The shores of Great Britain had for many years been so thoroughly protected by the British navy that few coast fortifications had been built, except at important naval stations. Invasion on a grand scale was plainly impossible, so long as the British fleets held control of the sea. With German guns across the Channel almost within hearing it was evident that a raiding party might easily reach the English shore on some foggy night. The English people were much disturbed. They had read the accounts of the horrible brutalities of the German troops in Belgium and eastern France, and they imagined their feelings if a band of such ferocious brutes were to land in England and pillage their peaceful homes. There was a humorous side to the way in which the yeomanry and territorials entrenched themselves along the eastern coast line, but the Germans, angry at the failure of their fleets, determined to disturb the British peace by raids, slight as the military advantage of such raids might be.  On November 2d a fleet of German warships sailed from the Elbe. They were three battle cruisers, the Seydlitz, the Moltke, and the Von Der Tann; two armored cruisers, the Blucher and the York, and three light cruisers, the Kolberg, the Graudenz, and the Strasburg. They were mainly fast vessels and the battle cruisers carried eleven-inch guns. Early in the morning they ran through the nets of a British fishing fleet. Later an old coast police boat, the Halcyon, was shot at a few times. About eight o\\'clock they were opposite Yarmouth, and proceeded to bombard that naval station from a distance of about ten miles. Their range was poor and their shells did no damage. They then turned swiftly for home, but on the road back the York struck a mine, and was sunk.   [Illustration: Map: Great Britain on the West, Denmark and Germany on the East.]   ENGLISH COAST TOWNS THAT WERE RAIDED   On the 16th of December they came again, full of revenge because of the destruction of von Spee and his squadron. Early in the morning early risers in Scarborough saw in the north four strange ships. Scarborough was absolutely without defense. It had once been an artillery depot but in recent years had been a cavalry station, and some few troops of this service were quartered there. Otherwise it was an open seaside resort. The German ships poured shells into the defenseless town, aiming at every large object they could see, the Grand Hotel, the gas works, the water works and the wireless station. Churches, public buildings, and hospitals were hit, as well as private houses. Over five hundred shells were fired. Then the ships turned around and moved away. The streets were crowded with puzzled and scared inhabitants, many of whom, as is customary in watering places, were women, children and invalids.  At nine o\\'clock Whitby, a coast town near Scarborough, saw two great ships steaming up from the south. Ten minutes later the ships were firing. The old Abbey of Hilda and Cedman was struck, but on the whole little damage was done. Another division of the invaders visited the Hartlepools. There there was a small fort, with a battery of old-fashioned guns, and off the shore was a small British flotilla, a gunboat and two destroyers. The three battle cruisers among the German raiders opened fire. The little British fleet did what they could but were quickly driven off. The German ships then approached the shore and fired on the English battery, the first fight with a foreign foe in England since 1690. The British battery consisted of some territorials who stood without wavering to their guns and kept up for half an hour a furious cannonading. A great deal of damage was done; churches, hospitals, workhouses and schools were all hit. The total death roll was 119, and the wounded over 300. Six hundred houses were damaged or destroyed, but there was a great deal of heroism, not only among the territorials, but among the inhabitants of the town, and when the last shots were fired all turned to the work of relief.  Somewhere between nine and ten o\\'clock the bold German fleet started for home. The British Grand Fleet had been notified of the raid and two battle cruiser squadrons were hurrying to intercept them. But the weather had thickened and the waters of the North Sea were covered with fog belts stretching for hundreds of miles. And so the raiders returned safe to receive their Iron Crosses. The German aim in such raids was probably to create a panic, and so interfere with the English military plans. If the English had not looked at the matter with common sense they might easily have been tempted to spend millions of pounds on seaboard fortifications, and keep millions of men at home who were more necessary in the armies in France. But the English people kept their heads.  Germany, perceiving the indignation of the world at these bombardments of defenseless watering places, endeavored to appease criticism by describing them as fortified towns. But the well-known excellence of the German system of espionage makes it plain that they knew the true condition of affairs. These towns were not selected as fortified towns, but because they were not, and destruction in unfortified towns it was thought would have a greater effect than in a fortified town where it would be regarded as among the natural risks of war.  During the rest of the year of 1914 no further sea fight took place in the North Sea nor was there any serious loss to the navy from torpedo or submarine. But on the first of January, 1915, the British ship Formidable, 15,000 tons, was struck by two torpedoes and sunk. The previous day she had left Sheerness with eight vessels of the Channel fleet and with no protection from destroyers. The night was a bright moonlight and for such vessels to be moving in line on such a night without destroyers shows gross carelessness. Out of a crew of 800 men only 201 were saved, and the rescue of this part of the crew was due to the seamanship of Captain Pillar of the trawler Providence, who managed to take most of those rescued on board his vessel.  On January 24th the German battle cruiser squadron under Rear-Admiral Hipper set sail from Wilhelmshaven. What his object was is not known. He had enlarged the mine field north of Helgoland and north of the mine field had stationed a submarine flotilla. It is likely that he was planning to induce the British fleet to follow him into the mine field, or within reach of his submarines. That same morning the British battle cruiser squadron under Vice-Admiral Sir David Beatty put to sea.  According to the official report of the English Admiral he was in command of the following vessels; battle cruisers, the Lion, Princess Royal, the Tiger, the New Zealand, and the Indomitable; light cruisers, the Southampton, the Nottingham, the Birmingham, the Lowestoft, the Arethusa, the Aurora and the Undaunted, with destroyer flotillas under Commodore Tyrwhitt. The German Admiral had with him the Seydlitz, the Moltke, the Derfflinger, the Blucher, six light cruisers and a destroyer flotilla. The English Admiral apparently had some hint of the plans of the German squadron. The night of the 23d had been foggy; in the morning, however, the wind came from the northeast and cleared off the mists. An abridgment of the official report gives a good account of the battle, sometimes called the battle of Dogger Bank:   \"At 7.25 A. M. the flash of guns was observed south-southeast; shortly afterwards the report reached me from the Aurora that she was engaged with enemy ships. I immediately altered course to south-southeast, increased speed, and ordered the light cruisers and flotillas to get in touch and report movements of enemy. This order was acted upon with great promptitude, indeed my wishes had already been forestalled by the respective senior officers, and reports almost immediately followed from the Southampton, Arethusa, and Aurora as to the position and composition of the enemy. The enemy had altered their course to southeast; from now onward the light cruisers maintained touch with the enemy and kept me fully informed as to their movements. The battle cruisers worked up to full speed, steering to the southward; the wind at the time was northeast, light, with extreme visibility.  \"At 7.30 A. M. the enemy were sighted on the port bow, steaming fast, steering approximately southeast, distance fourteen miles. Owing to the prompt reports received we had attained our position on the quarter of the enemy, and altered course to run parallel to them. We then settled down to a long stern chase, gradually increasing our speed until we reached 28.5 knots.  \"Great credit is due to the engineer staffs of the New Zealand and Indomitable. These ships greatly exceeded their speed. At 8.52 A. M., as we had closed within 20,000 yards of the rear ship, the battle cruisers maneuvered so that guns would bear and the Lion fired a single shot which fell short. The enemy at this time were in single line ahead, with light cruisers ahead and a large number of destroyers on their starboard beam. Single shots were fired at intervals to test the range, and at 9.09 the Lion made her first hit on the Blucher, the rear ship of the German line. At 9.20 the Tiger opened fire on the Blucher, and the Lion shifted to the third in the line, this ship being hit by several salvos. The enemy returned our fire at 9.14 A. M., the Princess Royal, on coming into range, opened fire on the Blucher. The New Zealand was also within range of the Blucher which had dropped somewhat astern, and opened fire on her. The Princess Royal then shifted to the third ship in the line (Derfflinger) inflicting considerable damage on her. Our flotilla cruisers and destroyers had gradually dropped from a position, broad on our beam, to our port quarter, so as not to foul our range with their smoke. But the enemy\\'s destroyers threatening attack, the Meteor and M division passed ahead of us.  \"About 9.45 the situation was about as follows: The Blucher, the fourth in their line, showed signs of having suffered severely from gun fire, their leading ship and number three were also on fire. The enemy\\'s destroyers emitted vast columns of smoke to screen their battle cruisers, and under cover of this the latter now appeared to have altered course to the northward to increase their distance. The battle cruisers therefore were ordered to form a line of bearing north-northwest, and proceeded at the utmost speed. Their destroyers then showed evident signs of an attempt to attack. The Lion and the Tiger opened fire upon them, and caused them to retire and resume their original course.  \"At 10.48 A. M. the Blucher, which had dropped considerably astern of the enemy\\'s line, hauled out to port, steering north with a heavy list, on fire, and apparently in a defeated condition. I consequently ordered the Indomitable to attack the enemy breaking northward. At 10.54 submarines were reported on the starboard bow, and I personally observed the wash of a periscope. I immediately turned to port. At 10.03 an injury to the Lion being reported as being incapable of immediate repair, I directed the Lion to shape course northwest.  \"At 11.20 I called the Attack alongside, shifting my flag to her, and proceeded at utmost speed to rejoin the squadron. I met them at noon, retiring north-northwest. I boarded and hoisted my flag on the Princess Royal, when Captain Brock acquainted me with what had occurred since the Lion fell out of line, namely, that the Blucher had been sunk and that the enemy battle cruisers had continued their course to the eastward in a considerably damaged condition. He also informed me that a Zeppelin and a seaplane had endeavored to drop bombs on the vessels which went to the rescue of the survivors of the Blucher.\"   It appears from this report that as soon as the Germans sighted the British fleet they promptly turned around and fled to the southeast. This flight, before they could have known the full British strength, suggests that the German Admiral was hoping to lure the British vessels into the Helgoland trap. The British gunnery was remarkably good, shot after shot taking effect at a distance of ten miles, and that too when moving at over thirty miles an hour. Over 120 of the crew of the Blucher were rescued and more would have been rescued if it had not been for the attack upon the rescue parties by the German aircraft. The injury to the Lion was very unfortunate. Admiral Beatty handed over charge of the battle cruisers to Rear-Admiral Moore, and when he was able to overtake the squadron he found that under Admiral Moore\\'s orders the British fleet were retiring. The British squadron at the moment of turning was seventy miles from Helgoland, and in no danger from its mine fields. What might have been a crushing victory became therefore only a partial one: the Germans lost the Blucher; the Derfflinger and the Seydlitz were badly injured, but it seems that with a little more persistence the whole German squadron might have been destroyed.  The result was a serious blow to Germany. This engagement was the first between modern big-gun ships. Particular interest is also attached to it because each squadron was accompanied by scouting and screening light cruisers and destroyers. It was fear of submarines and mines, moreover, that influenced the British to break off the engagement. A Zeppelin airship and a seaplane also took part, and perhaps assisted in the fire control of the Germans. The conditions surrounding this battle were ideal for illustrating the functions of battle cruisers. The German warship raid on the British coast of the previous month was still fresh in mind, and when this situation off the Dogger Bank arose the timely interposing of Admiral Beatty\\'s superior force, the fast chase, the long-range fighting, the loss of the Blucher and the hasty retreat of the enemy, were all particularly pleasing to the British people. As a result the battle cruiser type of ship attained great popularity.    CHAPTER XIV  NEW METHODS AND HORRORS OF WARFARE  When Germany embarked upon its policy of frightfulness, it held in reserve murderous inventions that had been contributed to the German General Staff by chemists and other scientists working in conjunction with the war. Never since the dawn of time had there been such a perversion of knowledge to criminal purposes; never had science contributed such a deadly toll to the fanatic and criminal intentions of a war-crazed class.  As the war uncoiled its weary length, and month after month of embargo and privation saw the morale of the German nation growing steadily lower, these murderous inventions were successively called into play against the Allies, but as each horror was put into play on the battle-field, its principles were solved by the scientists of the Allied nations, and the deadly engine of destruction was turned with trebled force against the Huns.  This happened with the various varieties of poison gas, with liquid fire, with trench knives, with nail-studded clubs, with armor used by shock troops, with airplane bombs, with cannon throwing projectiles weighing thousands of pounds great distances behind the battle lines. Not only did America and the Allies improve upon Germany\\'s pattern in these respects, but they added a few inventions that went far toward turning the scale against Germany. An example of these is the \"tank.\" Originally this was a caterpillar tractor invented in America and adopted in England. At first these were of two varieties, the male, carrying heavy guns only, and the females, equipped with machine guns. To these was later added the whippet tank, named after the racing dog developed in England. These whippet tanks averaged eighteen miles an hour, carrying death and terror into the ranks of the enemy. All the tanks were heavily armored and had as their motto the significant words \"Treat \\'Em Rough.\" The Germans designed a heavy anti-tank rifle about three feet longer than the ordinary rifle and carrying a charge calculated to pierce tank armor. These were issued to the German first line trenches at the rate of three to a company. That they were not particularly effective was proved by the ease with which the tanks of all varieties tore through the barbed wire entanglements and passed over the Hindenburg and Kriemhild lines, supposed by the Germans to be impregnable.  The tanks in effect were mobile artillery and were used as such by all the Allied troops. Germany frantically endeavored to manufacture tanks to meet the Allied monsters, but their efforts were feeble when compared with the great output opposed to them.  Before considering other inventions used for the first time in this war, it is well to understand the tremendous changes in methods and tactics made necessary by these discoveries.  Put into a sentence, the changed warfare amounts to this: it is a mobilization of material, of railroads, great guns, machine guns, food, airplanes and other engines of destruction quite as much as it is a mobilization of men.  The Germans won battle after battle at the beginning of the war because of their system of strategic railways that made it possible to transport huge armies to selected points in the shortest possible time both on the eastern and the western fronts. Lacking a system of transportation to match this, Russia lost the great battles that decided her fate, Belgium was over-run, and France, once the border was passed, became a battle-field upon which the Germans might extend their trench systems over the face of the land.  Lacking strategic railways to match those of Germany, France evolved an effective substitute in the modern system of automobile transportation. When von Kluck swung aside from Paris in his first great rush, Gallieni sent out from Paris an army in taxicabs that struck the exposed flank and went far toward winning the first battle of the Marne. It was the truck transportation system of the French along the famous \"Sacred Road\" back of the battle line at Verdun that kept inviolate the motto of the heroic town, \"They Shall Not Pass.\" Motor trucks that brought American reserves in a khaki flood won the second battle of the Marne. It was automobile transportation that enabled Haig to send the British Canadians and Australians in full cry after the retreating Germans when the backbone of the German resistance was broken before Lens, Cambrai, and Ostend.  America\\'s railway transportation system in France was one of the marvels of the war. Stretching from the sector of seacoast set apart for America by the French Government, it radiated far into the interior, delivering men, munitions and food in a steady stream. American engineers worked with their brothers-in-arms with the Allies to construct an inter-weaving system of wide-gauge and narrow-gauge roads that served to victual and munition the entire front and further serve to deliver at top speed whole army corps. It was this network of strategic railways that enabled the French to send an avalanche clad in horizon-blue to the relief of Amiens when Hindenburg made his final tremendous effort of 1918.  In its essentials, military effort in the great conflict may be roughly divided into   Open warfare,   Trench warfare,   Crater warfare.  The first battle of the Marne was almost wholly open warfare; so also were the battles of the Masurian Lakes, Allenstein, and Dunajec in the eastern theater of war, and most of the warfare on the Italian front between the Piave River and Gorizia.  In this variety of battle, airplanes and observation balloons play a prominent part. Once the enemy is driven out of its trenches, the message is flashed by wireless to the artillery and slaughter at long range begins. If there have been no intrenchments, as was the case in the first battle of the Marne, massed artillery send a plunging fire into the columns moving in open order and prepare the way for machine gunners and infantry to finish the rout.  In previous wars, cavalry played a heroic role in open warfare; only rarely has it been possible to use cavalry in the Great War. The Germans sent a screen of Uhlans before its advancing hordes into Belgium and Northern France in 1914. The Uhlans also were in the van in the Russian invasion, but with these exceptions, German cavalry was a negligible factor.  British and French cavalry were active in pursuit of the fleeing Teutons when the Hindenburg line was smashed in September of 1918. Outside of that brief episode, the cavalry did comparatively nothing so far as the Allies were concerned. It was the practice on both sides to dismount cavalry and convert it into some form of trench service. Trench mortar companies, bombing squads, and other specialty groups were organized from among the cavalrymen. Of course the fighting in the open stretches of Mesopotamia, South Africa and Russia involved the use of great bodies of cavalry. The trend of modern warfare, however, is to equip the cavalryman with grenades and bayonets, in addition to his ordinary gear, and to make of him practically a mounted infantryman.  Trench warfare occupied most of the time and made nine-tenths of the discomforts of the soldiers of both armies. If proof of the adaptive capacity of the human animal were needed, it is afforded by the manner in which the men burrowed in vermin-infested earth and lived there under conditions of Arctic cold, frequently enduring long deprivations of food, fuel, and suitable clothing. During the early stages of the war, before men became accustomed to the rigors of the trenches, many thousands died as a direct result of the exposure. Many thousand of others were incapacitated for life by \"trench feet,\" a group of maladies covering the consequences of exposure to cold and water which in those early days flowed in rivulets through most of the trenches. The trenches at Gallipoli had their own special brand of maladies. Heatstroke and a malarial infection were among these disabling agencies. Trench fever, a malady beginning with a headache and sometimes ending in partial paralysis and death, was another common factor in the mortality records.   But in spite of all these and other discomforts, in spite of the disgusting vermin that crawled upon the men both in winter and in summer, both sides mastered the trenches and in the end learned to live in them with some degree of comfort.  At first the trenches were comparatively straight, shallow affairs; then as the artillery searched them out, as the machine gunners learned the art of looping their fire so that the bullets would drop into the hiding places of the enemy, the trench systems gradually became more scientifically involved. After the Germans had been beaten at the Marne and had retired to their prepared positions along the Aisne, there commenced a series of flanking attempts by one side and the other which speedily resolved itself into the famous \"race to the sea.\" This was a competition between the opposing armies in rapid trench digging. The effort on either side was made to prevent the enemy from executing a flank movement. In an amazingly short time the opposing trenches extended from the Belgian coast to the Swiss border, making further outflanking attempts impossible of achievement.   [Illustration: Map: The North Sea and surrounding countries--Norway, Denmark, Great Britain, France, Belgium, Holland, Germany.]   FORTS, FLYING AND NAVAL BASES ON THE NORTH SEA   This was not the first time in history that intrenched armies opposed each other. The Civil War in this country set the fashion in that respect. The contending sides in the Great War, however, improved vastly upon the American example. Communicating trenches were constructed, leading back to the company kitchens, and finally to the open road leading back to the rest billets of the armies.  When night raiding commenced, it was speedily seen that straight trenches exposed whole companies of men to enfilading fire. Thereupon bastions were made and new defenses presented by zig-zagging the front-line trenches and the communicating ditches as well.  To the formidable obstacles presented by the trenches, equipped as they were with sand-bag parapets and firing steps, were added barbed-wire entanglements and pitfalls of various sorts. The greatest improvement was made by the Germans, and they added \"pill boxes.\" These were really miniature fortresses of concrete and armor plate with a dome-shaped roof and loopholes for machine gunners. Only a direct hit by a projectile from a big gun served to demolish a \"pill box.\" The Allies learned after many costly experiments that the best method to overcome these obstacles was to pass over and beyond them, leaving them isolated in Allied territory, where they were captured at the leisure of the attackers.  Trench warfare brings with it new instruments. There are the flame projectors, which throw fire to a distance of approximately a hundred feet. The Germans were the first to use these, but they were excelled in this respect by the inventive genius of the nations opposing them.  The use of poison gas, the word being used in its broad sense, is now general. It was first used by the Germans, but as in the case of flame throwers, the Allies soon gained the ascendency.

[Illustration: Painting]   CHARGING ON GERMAN TRENCHES IN GAS MASKS   Each British soldier carried two gas-proof helmets. At the first alarm   of gas the helmet was instantly adjusted, for to breathe even a whiff   of the yellow cloud meant death or serious injury. This picture shows   the earlier type before the respirator mask was devised to keep up   with Germany\\'s development of gas warfare.   The first use of asphyxiating gas was by the Germans during the first battle of Ypres. There the deadly compound was mixed in huge reservoirs back of the German lines. From these extended a system of pipes with vents pointed toward the British and Canadian lines. Waiting until air currents were moving steadily westward, the Germans opened the stop-cocks shortly after midnight and the poisonous fumes swept slowly, relentlessly forward in a greenish cloud that moved close to the earth. The result of that fiendish and cowardly act was that thousands of men died in horrible agony without a chance for their lives.  Besides that first asphyxiating gas, there soon developed others even more deadly. The base of most of these was chlorine. Then came the lachrymatory or \"tear-compelling\" gases, calculated to produce temporary or permanent blindness. Another German \"triumph\" was mustard gas. This is spread in gas shells, as are all the modern gases. The Germans abandoned the cumbersome gas-distributing system after the invention of the gas shell. These make a peculiar gobbling sound as they rush overhead. They explode with a very slight noise and scatter their contents broadcast. The liquids carried by them are usually of the sort that decompose rapidly when exposed to the air and give off the acrid gases dreaded by the soldiers. They are directed against the artillery as well as against intrenched troops. Every command, no matter how small, has its warning signal in the shape of a gong or a siren warning of approaching gas.  Gas masks were speedily discovered to offset the dangers of poison gases of all kinds. These were worn not only by troops in the field, but by artillery horses, pack mules, liaison dogs, and by the civilian inhabitants in back of the battle lines. Where used quickly and in accordance with instructions, these masks were a complete protection against attacks by gas.  The perfected gas masks used by both sides contained a chamber filled with a specially prepared charcoal. Peach pits were collected by the millions in all the belligerent countries to make this charcoal, and other vegetable substances of similar density were also used. Anti-gas chemicals were mixed with the charcoal. The wearer of the mask breathed entirely through the mouth, gripping a rubber mouthpiece while his nose was pinched shut by a clamp attached to the mask.  In training, soldiers were required to hold their breath for six seconds while the mask was being adjusted. It was explained to them that four breaths of the deadly chlorine gas was sufficient to kill; the first breath produced a spasm of the glottis; the second brought mental confusion and delirium; the third produced unconsciousness; and the fourth, death. The bag containing the gas mask and respirator was carried always by the soldier.  The soldier during the winter season in the front line trenches was a grotesque figure. His head was crowned with a helmet covered with khaki because the glint of steel would advertise his whereabouts. Beneath the helmet he wore a close fitting woolen cap pulled down tightly around his ears and sometimes tied or buttoned beneath his chin. Suspended upon his chest was the khaki bag containing gas mask and respirator. Over his outer garments were his belt, brace straps, bayonet and ammunition pouches. His rifle was slung upon his shoulder with the foot of a woolen sock covering the muzzle and the leg of the same sock wrapped around the breech. A large jerkin made of leather, without sleeves, was worn over the short coat. Long rubber boots reaching to the hips and strapped at ankle and hip completely covered his legs. When anticipating trench raids, or on a raiding party, a handy trench knife and carefully slung grenades were added to his equipment.  Airplane bombing ultimately changed the whole character of the war. It extended the fighting lines miles behind the battle front. It brought the horrors of night attacks upon troops resting in billets. It visited destruction and death upon the civilian population of cities scores of miles back of the actual front.  Germany transgressed repeatedly the laws of humanity by bombing hospitals far behind the battle front. Describing one of these atrocious attacks, which took place May 29, 1918, Colonel G. H. Andrews, chaplain of a Canadian regiment, said:  \"The building bombed was one of three large Red Cross hospitals at Boulenes and was filled with Allied wounded. A hospital in which were a number of wounded German prisoners stood not very far away.  \"The Germans could not possibly have mistaken the building they bombed for anything else but a hospital. There were flags with a red cross flying, and lights were turned on them so that they would show prominently. And the windows were brilliantly lighted. Those inside heard the buzz of the advancing airplanes, but did not give them a thought.  \"The machines came right on, ignoring the hospital with the German wounded, indicating they had full knowledge of their objective, until they were over a wing of the Red Cross hospital that contained the operating room on the ground floor. In the operating room a man was on the table for a most difficult surgical feat. Around him were gathered the staff of the hospital and its brilliant surgeons. Lieutenant Sage of New York had just given him the anesthetic when one of the airplanes let the bomb drop. It was a big fellow. It must have been all of 250 pounds of high explosive.  \"It hurtled downward, carrying the two floors before it. Through the gap thus made wounded men, the beds in which they lay, convalescents, and all on the floors came crashing down to the ground. The bomb\\'s force extended itself to wreck the operating room, where the man on the table, Lieutenant Sage, and all in the room were killed. In all there were thirty-seven lives lost, including three Red Cross nurses.  \"The building caught fire. The concussion had blown the stairs down, so that escape from the upper floors seemed impossible. But the convalescents and the soldiers, who had run to the scene of the bombing, let the very ill ones out of the windows, and escape was made in that way.  \"And then, to cap the climax, the German airplanes returned over the spot of their ghastly triumph and fired on the rescuers with machine guns. God will never forgive the Huns for that act alone. Nor will our comrades ever forget it.\"  The statement of Colonel Andrews was corroborated by a number of other officers.  To protect artillery against counter-fire of all kinds, both sides from the beginning used the art of camouflage. This was resorted to particularly against scouting airplanes. At first the branches of trees and similar natural cover were used to deceive the airmen. Later the guns themselves were painted with protective colorations, and screens of burlap were used instead of branches. The camoufleur, as the camouflage artist was called, speedily extended his activities to screens over highways, preventing airmen from seeing troops in motion, to the protective coloration of lookout posts, and of other necessary factors along the fighting front. Camouflage also found great usefulness in the protective coloration of battleships and merchant vessels. Scientific study went hand in hand with the art, the object being to confuse the enemy and to offer targets as small as possible to the enemy gunners.  Crater warfare came as a development of intensified artillery attacks upon trench systems. It was at Dunajec on the eastern front that for the first time in modern war the wheels of artillery were placed hub to hub in intensified hurricane fire upon enemy positions. The result there under von Mackensen\\'s direction was the rout of the Russians. When later the same tactics were employed on the western front, the result was to destroy whole trench systems with the exception of deep dugouts, and to send the occupants of the trenches into the craters, made by shell explosions, for protection.  It was observed that, these craters made excellent cover and when linked by vigorous use of the intrenching tools carried by every soldier, they made a fair substitute for the trenches. This observation gave root to an idea which was followed by both armies; this was the deliberate creation of crater systems by the artillery of the attacking force. Into these lines of craters the attacking infantry threw itself in wave after wave as it rushed toward the enemy trenches. The ground is so riddled by this intensive artillery fire that there is created what is known as \"moon terrain\", fields resembling the surface of the moon as seen through a powerful telescope. Troops on both sides were trained to utilize these shell holes to the utmost, each little group occupying a crater, keeping in touch with its nearest group and moving steadily in unison toward the enemy.  One detail in which this war surpassed all others was in the use of machine guns and grenades. The Germans were first to make extensive use of the machine gun as a weapon with which to produce an effective barrage. They established machine-gun nests at frequent intervals commanding the zone over which infantry was to advance and by skilful crossfire kept that terrain free from every living thing. The Germans preferred a machine gun, water cooled and of the barrel-recoil type. The English used a Vickers-Maxim and a Lewis gun, the latter the invention of an officer in the American army. The French preferred the Hotchkiss and the Saint-Etienne. The Americans standardized the Browning light and heavy machine guns, and these did effective service. It was asserted by American gunnery experts that the Browning excels all other weapons of its type.  Two general types of grenades were used on both sides. One a defensive bomb about the size of an orange, containing a bursting charge weighing twenty-two ounces. Then there was a grenade used for offensive work carrying about thirty-two ounces of high explosives. The defensive grenades were of cast iron and so made that they burst into more than a hundred jagged pieces when they exploded. These wounded or killed within a radius of one hundred and fifty yards. In exceptional instances, the range was higher.  The function of artillery in a modern battle is constantly extending. Both the big guns and the howitzers were the deciding factors in most of the military decisions reached during the war. Artillery is divided first between the big guns having a comparatively flat trajectory and the howitzers whose trajectory is curved. Then there is a further division into these four classes:   Field artillery,   Heavy artillery,   Railroad artillery,   Trench artillery.  The type of field artillery is the famous 75-millimeter gun used interchangeably by the French and Americans. It is a quick-firing weapon and is used against attacking masses and for the various kind of barrages, including an anti-aircraft barrage.  Included in the heavy artillery are guns and howitzers of larger caliber than the 75-millimeter. Three distinct and terrifying noises accompany explosions of these guns. First, there is the explosion when the shell leaves the gun; then there is the peculiar rattling noise like the passing of a railway train when the shells pass overhead; then there is the explosion at point of contact, a terrific concussion which produces the human condition called \"shell-shock,\" a derangement of body and brain, paralyzing nerve and muscle centers and frequently producing insanity.  The railroad artillery comprises huge guns pulled on railways by locomotives, each gun having a number of cars as part of its equipment. These are slow-firing guns of great power and hurling the largest projectiles known to warfare. The largest guns of this class were produced by American inventive genius as a reply to the German gun of St. Gobain Forest. This was a weapon which hurled a nine-inch shell from a distance of sixty-two miles into the heart of Paris. The damage done by it was comparatively slight and it had no appreciable effect upon the morale of the Parisians.  Its greatest damage was when it struck the Roman Catholic Church of St. Gervais on Good Friday, March 29, 1918, killing seventy-five persons and wounding ninety. Fifty-four of those killed were women, five being Americans. The total effect of the bombardment by this big gun was to arouse France, England and America to a fiercer fighting pitch. The late Cardinal Farley, Archbishop of New York, expressed this sentiment, when he sent the following message to the Archbishop of Paris:   Shocked by the brutal killing of innocent victims gathered at religious services to commemorate the passing of our blessed Saviour on Good Friday, the Catholics of New York join your noble protest against this outrage of the sanctuary on such a day and at such an hour and, expressing their sympathy to the bereaved relatives of the dead and injured, pledge their unfaltering allegiance in support of the common cause that unites our two great republics. May God bless the brave officers and men of the Allied armies in their splendid defense of liberty and justice!   Trench artillery are Stokes guns and other mortars hurling aerial torpedoes containing great quantities of high explosives. These have curved trajectories and are effective not only against trenches but also against deep dugouts, wire entanglements and listening posts.  One of the most important details of modern warfare is that of communication or liaison on the battlefield. This is accomplished by runners recruited from the trenches, by dogs, pigeons, telephone, radio.  As has been heretofore stated, the airplane considered in all its developments, is the newest and most important of factors in modern warfare. It photographs the enemy positions, it detects concentrations and other movements of the enemy, it makes surprise impossible, it is a deadly engine of destruction when used in spraying machine-gun fire upon troops in the open. As a bombing device, it surpasses the best and most accurate artillery.    CHAPTER XV  GERMAN PLOTS AND PROPAGANDA IN AMERICA  The pages of Germany\\'s militaristic history are black with many shameful deeds and plots. Those pages upon which are written the intrigues against the peace of America and against the lives and properties of American citizens during the period between the declaration of war in 1914 and the armistice ending the war, while not so bloody as those relating to the atrocities in Belgium and Northern France are still revolting to civilized mankind.  Germany not only paid for the murder of passengers on ships where its infernal machines were placed, not only conspired for the destruction of munition plants and factories of many kinds, not only sought to embroil the United States, then neutral, in a war with Mexico and Japan, but it committed also the crime of murderous hypocrisy by conspiring to do these wrongs under the cloak of friendship for this country.  It was in December of 1915 that the German Government sent to the United States for general publication in American newspapers this statement:   The German Government has naturally never knowingly accepted the support of any person, group of persons, society or organization seeking to promote the cause of Germany in the United States by illegal acts, by counsel of violence, by contravention of law, or by any means whatever that could offend the American people in the pride of their own authority.   The answer to this imperial lie came from the President of the United States, when, in his address to Congress, April 2, 1917, urging a declaration of war on Germany, he characterized the German spy system and its frightful fruits in the following language:  \"One of the things that has served to convince us that the Prussian autocracy was not and could never be our friend is that from the very outset of the present war it has filled our unsuspecting communities, and even our offices of government, with spies, and set criminal intrigues everywhere afoot against our national unity of counsel, our peace within and without, our industries and our commerce. Indeed it is now evident that its spies were here even before the war began; and it is unhappily not a matter of conjecture, but a fact proved in our courts of justice, that the intrigues which have more than once come perilously near to disturbing the peace and dislocating the industries of the country have been carried on at the instigation, with the support, and even under the personal direction of official agents of the Imperial Government accredited to the Government of the United States.\"  Austria co-operated with Germany in a feeble way in these plots and propaganda, but the master plotter was Count Johann von Bernstorff, Germany\\'s Ambassador. The Austro-Hungarian Ambassador, Constantin Theodor Dumba, Captain Franz von Papen, Captain Karl Boy-Ed, Dr. Heinrich F. Albert, and Wolf von Igel, all of whom were attached to the German Embassy, were associates in the intrigues. Franz von Rintelen operated independently and received his funds and instructions directly from Berlin.  One of the earliest methods of creating disorder in American munition plants and other industrial establishments engaged in war work was through labor disturbances. With that end in view a general German employment bureau was established in August, 1915, in New York City. It had branches in Philadelphia, Bridgeport, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Chicago and Cincinnati. These cities at that time were the centers of industries engaged in furnishing munitions and war supplies to the Entente allies. Concerning this enterprise Ambassador Dumba, writing to Baron Burian, Foreign Minister of Austria-Hungary, said:   A private German employment office has been established which provides employment for persons who have voluntarily given up their places, and it is already working well. We shall also join in and the widest support is assured us.   The duties of men sent from the German employment offices into munition plants may be gathered from the following frank circular issued on November 2, 1914, by the German General Headquarters and reprinted in the Freie Zeitung, of Berne.   GENERAL HEADQUARTERS TO THE MILITARY REPRESENTATIVE ON THE RUSSIAN AND FRENCH FRONTS, AS WELL AS IN ITALY AND NORWAY.  In all branch establishments of German banking houses in Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, China and the United States, special military accounts have been opened for special war necessities. Main headquarters authorizes you to use these credits to an unlimited extent for the purpose of destroying factories, workshops, camps, and the most important centers of military and civil supply belonging to the enemy. In addition to the incitement of labor troubles, measures must be taken for the damaging of engines and machinery plants, the destruction of vessels carrying war material to enemy countries, the burning of stocks of raw materials and finished goods, and the depriving of large industrial centers of electric power, fuel and food. Special agents, who will be placed at your disposal, will supply you with the necessary means for effecting explosions and fires, as well as with a list of people in the country under your supervision who are willing to undertake the task of destruction. (Signed) DR. E. FISCHER.   Shortly after the establishment of the German employment bureau, Ambassador Dumba sent the following communication to the Austrian Foreign Office:   It is my impression that we can disorganize and hold up for months, if not entirely prevent, the manufacture of munitions in Bethlehem and the Middle West, which, in the opinion of the German military attache, is of importance and amply outweighs the comparatively small expenditure of money involved.   Concerning the operations of the arson and murder squad organized by von Bernstorff, Dumba and their associates, it is only necessary to turn to the records of the criminal courts of the United States and Canada. Take for example the case against Albert Kaltschmidt, living in Detroit, Michigan. The United States grand jury sitting in Detroit indicted Kaltschmidt and his fellow conspirators upon the following counts:  \"To blow up the factory of the Peabody\\'s Company, Limited, at Walkerville, Ontario, ... engaged in manufacturing uniforms, clothing and military supplies ...  \"To blow up the building known as the Windsor Armories of the City of Windsor.  \"To blow up and destroy other plants and buildings in said Dominion of Canada, which were used for the manufacture of munitions of war, clothing and uniforms.  \"To blow up and destroy the great railroad bridges of the Canadian Pacific Railroad at Nipigon.  . . .  \"To employ and send into said Dominion of Canada spies to obtain military information.\"  Besides the acts enumerated in the indictment it was proved upon trial that Kaltschmidt and his gang planned to blow up the Detroit Screw Works where shrapnel was being manufactured, and to destroy the St. Clair tunnel, connecting Canada with the United States. Both of these plans failed. Associated with Kaltschmidt in these plots were Captain von Papen, Baron Kurt von Reiswitz, German consul-general in Chicago; Charles F. Respa, Richard Herman, and William M. Jarasch, the latter two German reservists. Testifying in the case Jarasch, a bartender, said: \"Jacobsen (an aide) told me that munition factories in Canada were to be blown up. Before I left for Detroit, Jacobsen and I went to the consulate. We saw the consul and he shook hands with me and wished me success.\"  Charles F. Respa, in his testimony made the following revelations in response to questions by the government\\'s representatives:  Q. How long had you been employed before he (Kaltschmidt) told you that he wanted you to blow up some of these factories? A. About three weeks.  Q. Did Kaltschmidt at the time speak of any particular place that he wanted you to blow up? A. The particular place was the Armory.  Q. Did he mention the Peabody Building at that time? A. Not particularly--he was more after the bridges and the armories and wanted those places blown up that made ammunition and military clothing.  Q. The explosion at the armories was to be timed so that it would occur when the soldiers were asleep there? A. Yes--he did not mention that he wanted to kill soldiers.  Q. Did he say that if the dynamite in the suitcase exploded it would kill the soldiers? A. I do not remember that he said so, but he must have known it.  Q. Did you take both grips? A. Yes. Q. Where did you set the first grip? A. By the Peabody plant (blown up on June 20,1915).  Q. Where did you put the other suitcase? A. Then I walked down the Walkerville road to the Armories at Windsor, and carried the suitcase.  Q. When you got to the Armories did you know where to place it? A. I had my instructions.  Q. From Kaltschmidt? A. Yes.  Q. Did you place this suitcase containing the dynamite bomb at the armory in a proper place to explode and do any damage? A. Yes.  Q. Was it properly connected so that the cap would explode and strike the dynamite? A. I fixed it so that it would not.  Q. Did you deliberately fix this bomb that you took to the Armories so that it would not explode? A. Yes.  Q. Why did you do that? A. I knew that the suitcase contained thirty sticks of dynamite and if exploded would blow up the Armories and all the ammunition and kill every man in it.  It is interesting to note in this connection that Kaltschmidt was sentenced to four years in the federal prison at Leavenworth, Kansas, and to pay a fine of $20,000. Horn\\'s sentence was eighteen months in the Atlanta penitentiary and a fine of $1,000.  Attempts were also made to close by explosions the tunnels through which the Canadian Pacific Railroad passes under the Selkirk Mountains in British Columbia. The German General Staff in this instance operated through Franz Bopp, the German consul-general in San Francisco, and Lieutenant von Brincken. J. H. van Koolbergen was hired to do this work. Concerning the negotiations, van Koolbergen made this statement:  \"Not knowing what he wanted I went to see him. He was very pleasant and told me that he was an officer in the German army and at present working in the secret service of the German Empire under Mr. Franz Bopp, the Imperial German consul.  \"I went to the consulate and met Franz Bopp and then saw von Brincken in another room. He asked me if I would do something for him in Canada and I answered him, \\'Sure, I will do something, even blow up bridges, if there is money in it.\\' And he said, \\'You are the man; if that is so, you can make good money.\\'  \"Von Brincken told me that they were willing to send me up to Canada to blow up one of the bridges on the Canadian Pacific Railroad or one of the tunnels. I asked him what was in it and he said he would talk it over with the German consul, Bopp.  \"I had accepted von Brincken\\'s proposition to go to Canada and he offered me $500 to defray my expenses. On different occasions, in his room, von Brincken showed me maps and information about Canada, and pointed out to me where he wanted the act to be done. This was to be between Revelstake and Vancouver on the Canadian Pacific Railroad, and I was to get $3,000 in case of a successful blowing up of a military bridge or tunnel.\"  Van Koolbergen only made a pretended effort to blow up the tunnel. He did furnish the evidence, however, which served to send Bopp and his associates to the penitentiary.  Even more sensational was the plot against the international bridge upon which the Grand Trunk Railway crosses the border between the United States and Canada at Vanceboro, Me.  Werner Horn was a German reserve lieutenant. Von Papen delivered to him a flat order to blow up the bridge and he gave him $700 for the purpose of perpetrating the outrage. Horn was partially successful. At his trial in Boston in June, 1917, he made the following confession:   \"I admit and state that the facts set forth in the indictments as to the conveyance of explosives on certain passenger trains from New York to Boston and from Boston to Vanceboro, in the State of Maine, are true. I did, as therein alleged, receive an explosive and conveyed the same from the city of New York to Boston, thence by common carrier from Boston to Vanceboro, Maine. On or about the night of February 1, 1915, I took said explosive in a suitcase in which I was conveying it and carried the same across the bridge at Vanceboro to the Canadian side, and there, about 1.10 in the morning of February 2, 1915, I caused said explosive to be exploded near or against the abutments of the bridge on the Canadian side, with intent to destroy the abutment and cripple the bridge so that the same could not be used for the passage of trains.\"   Bribery of Congressmen was intended by Franz von Rintelen, operating directly in touch with the German Foreign Office in Berlin. Count von Bernstorff sent the following telegram to Berlin in connection with his plan:   I request authority to pay out up to $50,000 in order, as on former occasions, to influence Congress through the organization you know of, which can perhaps prevent war. I am beginning in the meantime to act accordingly. In the above circumstances, a public official German declaration in favor of Ireland is highly desirable, in order to gain the support of the Irish influence here.   That it was Rintelen\\'s purpose to use large sums of money for the purpose of bribing Congressmen was stated positively by George Plochman, treasurer of the Transatlantic Trust Company, where Rintelen kept his deposits.  Rintelen was the main figure on this side of the water in the fantastic plot to have Mexico and Japan declare war upon the United States. During the trial of Rintelen in New York City in May, 1917, it was testified \"that he came to the United States in order to embroil it with Mexico and Japan if necessary; that he was doing all he could and was going to do all he could to embroil this country with Mexico; that he believed that if the United States had a war with Mexico it would stop the shipment of ammunition to Europe; that he believed it would be only a matter of time until we were involved with Japan.\"  Rintelen also said that \"General Huerta was going to return to Mexico and start a revolution there which would cause the United States to intervene and so make it impossible to ship munitions to Europe. Intervention,\" he said, \"was one of his trump cards.\"  Mexico was the happy hunting-ground for pro-German plotters, and the German Ambassador in Mexico, Heinrich von Eckhardt, was the leader in all the intrigues. The culmination of Germany\\'s effort against America on this continent came on January 19, 1917, when Dr. Alfred Zimmerman, head of the German Foreign Office, sent the following cable to Ambassador von Eckhardt:   On the first of February we intend to begin submarine warfare unrestricted. In spite of this, it is our intention to endeavor to keep neutral the United States of America.  If this attempt is not successful, we propose an alliance on the following basis with Mexico: That we shall make war together and together make peace. We shall give general financial support, and it is understood that Mexico is to reconquer the lost territory in New Mexico, Texas and Arizona. The details are left to you for settlement. You are instructed to inform the President of Mexico of the above in the greatest confidence as soon as it is certain that there will be an outbreak of war with the United States, and suggest that the President of Mexico, on his own initiative, should communicate with Japan suggesting adherence at once to this plan; at the same time, offer to mediate between Germany and Japan.  Please call to the attention of the President of Mexico that the employment of ruthless submarine warfare now promises to compel England to make peace in a few months. ZIMMERMAN.   This was almost three months before the United States entered the war. As an example of German blindness and diplomatic folly it stands unrivaled in the annals of the German Foreign Office.  Plots against shipping were the deadliest in which the German conspirators engaged. Death and destruction followed in their wake. In direct connection of von Bernstorff and his tools with these outrages the following testimony by an American secret service man employed by Wolf von Igel is interesting. It refers to an appointment with Captain von Kleist, superintendent of Scheele\\'s bomb factory in Hoboken, N. J.  \"We sat down and we spoke for about three hours. I asked him the different things that he did, and said if he wanted an interview with Mr. von Igel, my boss, he would have to tell everything. So he told me that von Papen gave Dr. Scheele, the partner of von Kleist in this factory, a check for $10,000 to start this bomb factory. He told me that he, Mr. von Kleist, and Dr. Scheele and a man by the name of Becker on the Friedrich der Grosse were making the bombs, and that Captain Wolpert, Captain Bode and Captain Steinberg, had charge of putting these bombs on the ships; they put these bombs in cases and shipped them as merchandise on these steamers, and they would go away on the trip and the bombs would go off after the ship was out four or five days, causing a fire and causing the cargo to go up in flames. He also told me that they have made quite a number of these bombs; that thirty of them were given to a party by the name of O\\'Leary, and that he took them down to New Orleans where he had charge of putting them on ships down there, this fellow O\\'Leary.\"  About four hundred bombs were made under von Igel\\'s direction; explosions and fires were caused by them on thirty-three ships sailing from New York harbor alone.  Four of the bombs were found at Marseilles on a vessel which sailed from Brooklyn in May, 1915. The evidence collected in the case led to the indictment of the following men for feloniously transporting on the steamship Kirk Oswald a bomb or bombs filled with chemicals designed to cause incendiary fires: Rintelen, Wolpert, Bode, Schmidt, Becker, Garbade, Praedel, Paradies, von Kleist, Schimmel, Scheele, Steinberg and others. The last three named fled from justice, Scheele being supplied with $1,000 for that purpose by Wolf von Igel. He eluded the Federal authorities until April, 1918, when he was found hiding in Cuba under the protection of German secret service agents. All the others except Schmidt were found guilty and sentenced, on February 5, 1918, to imprisonment for eighteen months and payment of a fine of $2,000 each. It was proved during the trial that Rintelen had hired Schimmel, a German lawyer, to see that bombs were placed on ships.  Schmidt, von Kleist, Becker, Garbade, Praedel and Paradies had already been tried for conspiracy to make bombs for concealment on ocean-going vessels, with the purpose of setting the same on fire. All were found guilty, and on April 6, 1917, von Kleist and Schmidt were sentenced to two years imprisonment and a fine of $500 each.  Robert Fay, a former officer in the German army, who came to the United States in April, 1915, endeavored to prevent the traffic in munitions by sinking the laden ships at sea. In recounting the circumstances of his arrival here to the chief of the United States secret service, Fay said:   \". . .I had in the neighborhood of $4,000.... This money came from a man who sent me over ... (named) Jonnersen. The understanding was that it might be worth while to stop the shipment of artillery munitions from this country. . . . I imagined Jonnersen to be in the (German) secret service.\"  After stating that he saw von Papen and Boy-Ed, and that neither would have anything to do with him, apparently because suspicious of his identity, Fay continued:  \"I did not want to return (to Germany) without having carried out my intention, that is, the destruction of ships carrying munitions. I proceeded with my experiments and tried to get hold of as much explosive matter as in any way possible. . . .\"  Fay and two confederates were arrested in a lonely spot near Grantwood, New Jersey, while testing an explosive. During his examination at police headquarters in Weehawken immediately after the arrest he was questioned as follows:  Q. That large machine you have downstairs, what is that?  A. That is a patent of mine. It is a new way of getting a time fuse. ...  Q. Did you know where Scholz (Fay\\'s brother-in-law) had this machine made?  A. In different machine shops.  Q. What material is it you wanted (from Daeche, an accomplice)?  A. Trinitrotoluol (T. N. T.). ...  Q. How much did the machinery cost?  A. Roughly speaking, $150 or $200.  Q. What would be the cost of making one and filling it with explosives?  A. About $250 each ... If they had given me money enough I should simply have been able to block the shipping entirely.  Q. Do you mean you could have destroyed every ship that left the harbor by means of those bombs?  A. I would have been able to stop so many that the authorities would not have dared (to send out any ships).  It was proved during Fay\\'s trial that his bomb was a practical device, and that its forty pounds of explosive would sink any ship to which it was attached.  Fay and his accomplices, Scholz and Daeche, were convicted of conspiracy to attach explosive bombs to the rudders of vessels, with the intention of wrecking the same when at sea, and were sentenced, on May 9, 1916, to terms of eight, four and two years respectively, in the federal penitentiary at Atlanta. Dr. Herbert Kienzle and Max Breitung, who assisted Fay in procuring explosives, were indicted on the same charge. Both were interned.  Another plan for disabling ships was suggested by a man who remained for some time unknown. He called one day at the German Military Information Bureau, maintained at 60 Wall Street by Captain von Papen, of the German embassy, and there gave the following outline of his plan:  \"I intend to cause serious damage to vessels of the Allies leaving ports of the United States by placing bombs, which I am making myself, on board. These bombs resemble ordinary lumps of coal and I am planning to have them concealed in the coal to be laden on steamers of the Allies. I have already discussed this plan with ... at ... and he thinks favorably of my idea. I have been engaged on similar work in ... after the outbreak of the war, together with Mr. von ...\"   [Illustration: Painting]   WOMEN AT WORK THAT MEN MAY FIGHT   The women of the world took up quickly almost every masculine task in   industry to release their menfolk for the firing line. They were   especially valuable in the munitions factories of England, as shown   above. The women in the foreground are testing shell cases for size,   while those in the background work the lathes.   [Illustration: Painting]   THE FINAL TRIBUTE   Allied airman dropping a wreath on the grave of a comrade who fell and   was buried within the German lines.   [Illustration: Photograph]   A BELGIAN MILITARY OBSERVATION BALLOON   Large numbers of these balloons, which came to be known as sausages,   were used by the Allied armies on all fronts.   The German secret service report from which the above excerpt is taken states that the maker of the bomb was paid by check No. 146 for $150 drawn on the Riggs National Bank of Washington. A photographic copy of this check shows that it was payable to Paul Koenig, of the Hamburg-American Line, and was signed by Captain von Papen. On the counterfoil is written this memorandum, \"For F. J. Busse.\" Busse confessed later that he had discussed with Captain von Papen at the German Club in New York City the plan of damaging the boilers of munition ships with bombs which resembled lumps of coal.  Free access to Allied ships laden with supplies for Vladivostok would have been invaluable to the conspirators, and in order to obtain it Charles C. Crowley, a detective employed by Consul-General Bopp, resorted to the extraordinary scheme revealed in the following letter to Madam Bakhmeteff, wife of the Russian Ambassador to the United States:   MME J. BAKHMETEFF, care Imperial Russian Embassy, Newport, R. I.: DEAR MADAM:--By direction of the Imperial Russian Consul-General of San Francisco, I beg to submit the following on behalf of several fruit-growers of the State of California. As it is the wish of certain growers to contribute several tons of dried fruit to the Russian Red Cross they desire to have arrangements made to facilitate the transportation of this fruit from Tacoma, Washington, to Vladivostok, and as we are advised that steamships are regularly plying between Tacoma and Vladivostok upon which government supplies are shipped we would like to have arrangements made that these fruits as they might arrive would be regularly consigned to these steamers and forwarded. It would be necessary, therefore, that an understanding be had with the agents of these steamship lines at Tacoma that immediate shipments be made via whatever steamers might be sailing.  It is the desire of the donors that there be no delay in the shipments as delays would lessen the benefits intended to those for whom the fruit was provided .... Respectfully yours, C. C. CROWLEY.   The statements of Louis J. Smith and van Koolbergen, combined with a mass of other evidence consisting in part of letters and telegrams, caused the grand jury to indict Consul-General Bopp, his staff and his hired agents, for conspiracy to undertake a military enterprise against Canada. Among the purposes of this enterprise specified in the indictment was the following:  \"To blow up and destroy with their cargoes and crews any and all vessels belonging to Great Britain, France, Japan or Russia found within the limits of Canada, which were laden with horses, munitions of war, or articles of commerce in course of transportation to the above countries....\"  The following descriptions have been made by the United States Government of the tools of von Bernstorff in German plots:  Paul Koenig, the head of the Hamburg-American secret service, who was active in passport frauds, who induced Gustave Stahl to perjure himself and declare the Lusitania armed, and who plotted the destruction of the Welland Canal. In his work as a spy he passed under thirteen aliases in this country and Canada.  Captains Boy-Ed, von Papen, von Rintelen, Tauscher, and von Igel were all directly connected with the German Government itself. There is now in the possession of the United States Government a check made out to Koenig and signed by von Papen, identified by number in a secret report of the German Bureau of Investigation as being used to procure $150 for the payment of a bomb-maker, who was to plant explosives disguised as coal in the bunkers of the merchant vessels clearing from the port of New York. Boy-Ed, Dr. Bunz, the German ex-minister to Mexico, the German consul at San Francisco, and officials of the Hamburg-American and North German Lloyd steamship lines evaded customs regulations and coaled and victualed German raiders at sea. Von Papen and von Igel supervised the making of the incendiary bombs on the Friedrich der Grosse, then in New York Harbor, and stowed them away on outgoing ships. Von Rintelen financed Labor\\'s National Peace Council, which tried to corrupt legislators and labor leaders.  A lesser light of this galaxy was Robert Fay, who invented an explosive contrivance which he tied to the rudder posts of vessels. According to his confession and that of his partner in murder, the money came from the German secret police.  Among the other tools of the German plotters were David Lamar and Henry Martin, who, in the pay of Captain von Rintelen, organized and managed the so-called Labor\\'s National Peace Council, which sought to bring about strikes, an embargo on munitions, and a boycott of the banks which subscribed to the Anglo-French loan. A check for $5,000 to J. F. J. Archibald for propaganda work, and a receipt from Edwin Emerson, the war correspondent, for $1,000 traveling expenses were among the documents found in Wolf von Igel\\'s possession.  Others who bore English names were persuaded to take leading places in similar organizations which concealed their origin and real purpose. The American Embargo Conference arose out of the ashes of Labor\\'s Peace Council, and its president was American, though the funds were not. Others tampered with were journalists who lent themselves to the German propaganda and who went so far as to serve as couriers between the Teutonic embassies in Washington and the governments in Berlin and Vienna. A check of $5,000 was discovered which Count von Bernstorff had sent to Marcus Braun, editor of Fair Play. And a letter was discovered which George Sylvester Viereck, editor of the Fatherland, sent to Privy Councilor Albert, the German agent, arranging for a monthly subsidy of $1,750, to be delivered to him through the hands of intermediaries--women whose names he abbreviates \"to prevent any possible inquiry.\" There is a record of $3,000 paid through the German embassy to finance the lecture tour of Miss Ray Beveridge, an American artist, who was further to be supplied with German war pictures.  The German propagandists also directed their efforts to poisoning the minds of the people through the circulation of lies concerning affairs in France and at home. Here are some of the rumors circulated throughout the country that were nailed as falsehoods:  It was said that the national registration of women by the Food Administration was to find out how much money each had in the bank, how much of this was owed, and everything about each registrant\\'s personal affairs.  That the millions collected from the public for the Red Cross went into the pockets of thieves, and that the soldiers and sailors got none of it, nor any of its benefits.  That base hospital units had been annihilated while en route overseas.  That leading members of other hospital units had been executed as spies by the American Government.  That canned goods put up by the housewives were to be seized by the government and appropriated to the use of the army and navy.  That soldiers in training were being instructed to put out the eyes of every German captured.  That all of the \"plums\" at the officers\\' training camps fell to Roman Catholics. The plums went to Protestants when the propagandist talked to a Catholic.  That the registration of women was held so that girls would be enticed into the cities where white slaves were made of them.  That the battleship Pennsylvania had been destroyed with everyone on board by a German submarine.  That more than seventy-five per cent of the American soldiers in France had been infected with venereal diseases.  That intoxicants were given freely to American soldiers in Y. M. C. A. and Knights of Columbus huts in France.  But the lies and the plots failed to make any impression on the morale of American citizenry. In fact, America from the moment war was declared against Germany until the time an armistice was declared, seemed to care for nothing but results. Charges of graft made with bitter invective in Congress created scarcely more than a ripple. The harder the pro-German plotters worked for the destruction of property and the incitement to labor disturbances, the closer became the protective network of Americanism against these anti-war influences. After half a dozen German lies had been casually passed from mouth to mouth as rumors; the American people came to look upon other mischievous propaganda in its true light. Patriotic newspapers in every community exposed the false reports and citizens everywhere were on their guard against the misstatements. It was noticeable that the propaganda was intensified just previous to and during the several Liberty Loan campaigns. Proof that the American spirit rises superior to anti-American influences is furnished by the glorious records of these Liberty Loans. Every one was over-subscribed despite the severest handicaps confronted by any nation.    CHAPTER XVI  SINKING OF THE LUSITANIA  The United States was brought face to face with the Great War and with what it meant in ruthless destruction of life when, on May 7, 1915, the crack Cunard Liner Lusitania, bound from New York to Liverpool, with 1,959 persons aboard, was torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine off Old Head of Kinsale, Southwestern Ireland. Two torpedoes reached their mark. The total number of lives lost when the ship sunk was 1,198. Of these 755 were passengers and the remainder were members of the crew. Of the drowned passengers, 124 were Americans and 35 were infants.  \"Remember the Lusitania!\" later became a battlecry just as \"Remember the Maine!\" acted as a spur to Americans during the war with Spain. It was first used by the famous \"Black Watch\" and later American troops shouted it as they went into battle.  The sinking of the Lusitania, with its attendant destruction of life, sent a thrill of horror through the neutral peoples of the world. General opposition to the use of submarines in attacking peaceful shipping, especially passenger vessels, crystallized as the result of the tragedy, and a critical diplomatic controversy between the United States and Germany developed. The American Government signified its determination to break off friendly relations with the German Empire unless the ruthless practices of the submarine commanders were terminated. Germany temporarily agreed to discontinue these practices.  Among the victims of the Cunarder\\'s destruction were some of the best known personages of the Western Hemisphere. Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt, multimillionaire; Charles Frohman, noted theatrical manager; Charles Klein, dramatist, who wrote \"The Lion and the Mouse;\" Justus Miles Forman, author, and Elbert Hubbard, known as Fra Elbertus, widely read iconoclastic writer, were drowned.  The ocean off the pleasant southern coast of Ireland was dotted with bodies for days after the sinking of the liner. The remains of many of the victims, however, never were recovered.  When the Lusitania prepared to sail from New York on her last trip, fifty anonymous telegrams addressed to prominent persons aboard the vessel warned the recipients not to sail with the liner. In addition to these warnings was an advertisement inserted in the leading metropolitan newspapers by the German embassy, advising neutral persons that British steamships were in danger of destruction in the war zone about the British Isles. This notice appeared the day the Lusitania sailed, May 1st, and was placed next the advertisement of the Cunard Line. Following is the advertisement:   NOTICE! Travelers intending to embark on the Atlantic voyage are reminded that a state of war exists between Germany and her allies and Great Britain and her allies; that the zone of war includes the waters adjacent to the British Isles; that, in accordance with formal notice given by the Imperial German Government, vessels flying the flag of Great Britain, or of any of her allies, are liable to destruction in those waters and that travelers sailing in the war zone on ships of Great Britain or her allies do so at their own risk. Imperial German Embassy, Washington, D. C., April 22, 1915.   Little or no attention was paid to the warnings, only the usual number of persons canceling their reservations, The general agent of the Cunard Line at New York assured the passengers that the Lusitania\\'s voyage would be attended by no risk whatever, referring to the liner\\'s speed and water-tight compartments.  As the great Cunarder drew near the scene of her disaster, traveling at moderate speed along her accustomed route, there was news of freight steamers falling victims to Germany\\'s undersea campaign. It was not definitely established, however, whether the liner was warned of danger.  At two o\\'clock on the fine afternoon of May 7th, some ten miles off the Old Head of Kinsale, the Lusitania was sighted by a submarine 1,000 yards away. A second later the track of a torpedo, soon followed by another, was seen and each missile crashed into the Lusitania\\'s hull with rending detonations.  Many were killed or injured immediately by the explosions.  Before the liner\\'s headway was lost, some boats were lowered, and capsized as a result. The immediate listing of the steamship added to the difficulties of rescue and increased the tragical toll of dead.  Much heroism and calmness were displayed by many in the few minutes the liner remained afloat. The bearing of Frohman, Vanderbilt, Hubbard and other Americans was declared to have been particularly inspiring.  Rescue ships and naval vessels rushed to the aid of the survivors from all nearby ports of Ireland.  It has been said that the sinking of the Lusitania was carefully planned by the chiefs of the German admiralty. They expected, it was believed, to demoralize British shipping and strike terror into the minds of the British people by showing that the largest and swiftest of liners could easily be destroyed by submarines.  According to the Paris paper, La Guerre Sociale, published by Gustave Herve, the submarine responsible was the U-21, commanded by Lieutenant Hersing. Hersing was said to have been decorated for his deed. The U-21 afterwards was destroyed and the story of its participation in the sinking of the great Cunarder never was confirmed.  Immediately upon the news of the Lusitania disaster, President Wilson took steps to hold Germany to that \"strict accountability\" of which he had notified Berlin when the war-zone operations were begun earlier in the year. His first communication, protesting against the sinking of the liner in the name of humanity and demanding disavowal, indemnity and assurance that the crime would not be repeated, was despatched on May 13th. On May 30th the German reply argued that the liner carried munitions of war and probably was armed.  The following official German version of the incident by the German Admiralty Staff over the signature of Admiral Behncke was given:  \"The submarine sighted the steamer, which showed no flag, May 7th, at 2.20 o\\'clock, Central European time, afternoon, on the southeast coast of Ireland, in fine, clear weather.  \"At 3.10 o\\'clock one torpedo was fired at the Lusitania, which hit her starboard side below the captain\\'s bridge. The detonation of the torpedo was followed immediately by a further explosion of extremely strong effect. The ship quickly listed to starboard and began to sink.  \"The second explosion must be traced back to the ignition of quantities of ammunition inside the ship.\"  These extenuations were all rejected by the United States, and the next note prepared by President Wilson was of such character that Secretary of State Bryan resigned. This second communication was sent on June 11th, and on June 22d another was cabled. September 1st Germany accepted the contentions of the United States in regard to submarine warfare upon peaceful shipping. There were continued negotiations concerning the specific settlement to be made in the case of the Lusitania.  On February 4th, 1916, arrived a German proposition which, coupled with personal parleys carried on between German Ambassador von Bernstorff and United States Secretary of State Lansing, seemed in a fair way to conclude the whole controversy. It was announced on February 8th that the two nations were in substantial accord and Germany was declared to have admitted the sinking of the liner was wrong and unjustified and promised that reparation would be made.  However, a week later, when Germany took advantage of tentative American proposals concerning the disarming of merchant ships, by announcing that all armed hostile merchantmen would be treated as warships and attacked without warning, the almost completed agreement was overthrown. The renewed negotiations were continuing when the torpedoing of the cross-channel passenger ship Sussex, without warning, on March 24th, impelled the United States to issue a virtual ultimatum, demanding that the Germans immediately cease their present methods of naval warfare on pain of the rupture of diplomatic relations with the most powerful existing neutral nation.  The Lusitania, previous to her sinking, had figured in the war news, first at the conflict, when it was feared she had been captured by a German cruiser while she was dashing across the Atlantic toward Liverpool, and again in February of 1915, when she flew the American flag as a ruse to deceive submarines while crossing the Irish Sea. This latter incident called forth a protest from the United States.  On her fatal trip the cargo of the Lusitania was worth $735,000.  As a great transatlantic liner, the Lusitania was a product of the race for speed, which was carried on for years among larger steamship companies, particularly of England and Germany. When the Lusitania was launched, it was the wonder of the maritime world. Its mastery of the sea, from the standpoint of speed, was undisputed.  Progress of the Lusitania on its first voyage to New York, September 7, 1907, was watched by the world. The vessel made the voyage in five days and fifty-four minutes, at that time a record. Its fastest trip, made on the western voyage, was four days eleven hours forty-two minutes. This record, however, was wrested from it subsequently by the Mauretania, a sister ship, which set the mark of four days ten hours forty-one minutes, that still stands.  Although the Lusitania was surpassed in size by several other liners built subsequently, it never lost the reputation acquired at the outset of its career. Its speed and luxurious accommodations made it a favorite, and its passenger lists bore the names of many of the most prominent Atlantic wayfarers. The vessel was pronounced by its builders to be as nearly unsinkable as any ship could be.  Everything about the Lusitania was of colossal dimensions.  Her rudder weighed sixty-five tons. She carried three anchors of ten tons each. The main frames and beams, placed end to end, would extend thirty miles. The Lusitania was 785 feet long, 88 feet beam, and 60 feet deep. Her gross tonnage was 32,500 and her net tonnage, 9,145.  Charges were made that one or more guardian submarines deliberately drove off ships nearby which might have saved hundreds of lives lost when the Lusitania went down. Captain W. F. Wood, of the Leyland Line steamer Etonian, said his ship was prevented from going to the rescue of the passengers of the sinking Lusitania by a warning that an attack might be made upon his own vessel.  The Etonian left Liverpool, May 6th. When Captain Wood was forty-two miles from Kinsale he received a wireless call from the Lusitania for immediate assistance.  The call was also picked up by the steamers City of Exeter and Narragansett. The Narragansett, Captain Wood said, was made a target for submarine attack, a torpedo missing her by a few feet, and her commander then warned Captain Wood not to attempt to reach the Lusitania.  \"It was two o\\'clock in the afternoon, May 7th, that we received the wireless S O S,\" said Captain Wood. \"I was then forty-two miles distant from the position he gave me. The Narragansett and the City of Exeter were nearer the Lusitania and she answered the SOS.  \"At five o\\'clock I observed the City of Exeter cross our bows and she signaled, \\'Have you heard anything of the disaster?\\'  \"At that moment I saw a periscope of a submarine between the Tonina and the City of Exeter, about a quarter of a mile directly ahead of us. She dived as soon as she saw us.  \"I signaled to the engine room for every available inch of speed. Then we saw the submarine come up astern of us. I now ordered full speed ahead and we left the submarine behind. The periscope remained in sight about twenty minutes.  \"No sooner had we lost sight of the submarine astern, than another appeared on the starboard bow. This one was directly ahead and on the surface, not submerged.  \"I starboarded hard away from him, he swinging as we did. About eight minutes later he submerged. I continued at top speed for four hours and saw no more of the submarines. It was the ship\\'s speed that saved her, that\\'s all.  \"The Narragansett, as soon as she heard the S O S call, went to the assistance of the Lusitania. One of the submarines discharged a torpedo at her and missed her by not more than eight feet. The Narragansett then warned us not to attempt to go to the rescue, and I got her wireless call while I was dodging the two submarines. You can see that three ships would have gone to the assistance of the Lusitania had they not been attacked by the two submarines.\"  The German Government defended the brutal destruction of non-combatants by the false assertions that the Lusitania was an armed vessel and that it was carrying a great store of munitions. Both of these accusations were proved to be mere fabrications. The Lusitania was absolutely unarmed and the nearest approach to munitions was a consignment of 1,250 empty shell cases and 4,200 cases of cartridges for small arms.  Intense indignation swept over the neutral world, the tide rising highest in America. It well may be said that the destruction of the Lusitania was one of the greatest factors in driving America into the war with Germany.  Concerning the charge that the Lusitania carried munitions, Dudley Field Malone, Collector of the port of New York, testified that he made personal and close inspection of the ship\\'s cargo and saw that it carried no guns and that there were no munitions in its cargo.  His statement follows:  \"This report is not correct. The Lusitania was inspected before sailing, as is customary. No guns were found, mounted or unmounted, and the vessel sailed without any armament. No merchant ship would be allowed to arm in this port and leave the harbor.\"  Captain W. T. Turner, of the Lusitania, testifying before the coroner\\'s inquest at Kinsale, Ireland, was interrogated as follows:  \"You were aware threats had been made that the ship would be torpedoed?\"  \"We were,\" the Captain replied.  \"Was she armed?\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"What precautions did you take?\"  \"We had all the boats swung when we came within the danger zone, between the passing of Fastnet and the time of the accident.\"  The coroner asked him whether he had received a message concerning the sinking of a ship off Kinsale by a submarine. Captain Turner replied that he had not.  \"Did you receive any special instructions as to the voyage?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Are you at liberty to tell us what they were?\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"Did you carry them out?\"  \"Yes, to the best of my ability.\"  \"Tell us in your own words what happened after passing Fastnet.\"  \"The weather was clear,\" Captain Turner answered. \"We were going at a speed of eighteen knots. I was on the port side and heard Second Officer Hefford call out:  \"\\'Here\\'s a torpedo!\\'  \"I ran to the other side and saw clearly the wake of a torpedo. Smoke and steam came up between the last two funnels. There was a slight shock. Immediately after the first explosion there was another report, but that may possibly have been internal.  \"I at once gave the order to lower the boats down to the rails, and I directed that women and children should get into them. I also had all the bulkheads closed.  \"Between the time of passing Fastnet, about 11 o\\'clock, and of the torpedoing I saw no sign whatever of any submarines. There was some haze along the Irish coast, and when we were near Fastnet I slowed down to fifteen knots. I was in wireless communication with shore all the way across.\"  Captain Turner was asked whether he had received any message in regard to the presence of submarines off the Irish coast. He replied in the affirmative. Questioned regarding the nature of the message, he replied:  \"I respectfully refer you to the admiralty for an answer.\" \"I also gave orders to stop the ship,\" Captain Turner continued, \"but we could not stop. We found that the engines were out of commission. It was not safe to lower boats until the speed was off the vessel. As a matter of fact, there was a perceptible headway on her up to the time she went down.  \"When she was struck she listed to starboard. I stood on the bridge when she sank, and the Lusitania went down under me. She floated about eighteen minutes after the torpedo struck her. My watch stopped at 2.36. I was picked up from among the wreckage and afterward was brought aboard a trawler.  \"No warship was convoying us. I saw no warship, and none was reported to me as having been seen. At the time I was picked up I noticed bodies floating on the surface, but saw no living persons.\"  \"Eighteen knots was not the normal speed of the Lusitania, was it?\"  \"At ordinary times,\" answered Captain Turner, \"she could make twenty-five knots, but in war times her speed was reduced to twenty-one knots. My reason for going eighteen knots was that I wanted to arrive at Liverpool bar without stopping, and within two or three hours of high water.\"  \"Was there a lookout kept for submarines, having regard to previous warnings?\"  \"Yes, we had double lookouts.\"  \"Were you going a zigzag course at the moment the torpedoing took place?\"  \"No. It was bright weather, and land was clearly visible.\"  \"Was it possible for a submarine to approach without being seen?\"  \"Oh, yes; quite possible.\"  \"Something has been said regarding the impossibility of launching the boats on the port side?\"  \"Yes,\" said Captain Turner, \"owing to the listing of the ship.\"  \"How many boats were launched safely?\"  \"I cannot say.\"  \"Were any launched safely?\"  \"Yes, and one or two on the port side.\"  \"Were your orders promptly carried out?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Was there any panic on board?\"  \"No, there was no panic at all. It was almost calm.\"  \"How many persons were on board?\"  \"There were 1,500 passengers and about 600 crew.\"  By the Foreman of the Jury--\"In the face of the warnings at New York that the Lusitania would be torpedoed, did you make any application to the admiralty for an escort?\"  \"No, I left that to them. It is their business, not mine. I simply had to carry out my orders to go, and I would do it again.\"  Captain Turner uttered the last words of this reply with great emphasis.  By the Coroner--\"I am glad to hear you say so, Captain.\"  By the Juryman--\"Did you get a wireless to steer your vessel in a northern direction?\"  \"No,\" replied Captain Turner.  \"Was the course of the vessel altered after the torpedoes struck her?\"  \"I headed straight for land, but it was useless. Previous to this the watertight bulkheads were closed. I suppose the explosion forced them open. I don\\'t know the exact extent to which the Lusitania was damaged.\"  \"There must have been serious damage done to the water-tight bulkheads?\"  \"There certainly was, without doubt.\"  \"Were the passengers supplied with lifebelts?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Were any special orders given that morning that lifebelts be put on?\"  \"No.\"  \"Was any warning given before you were torpedoed?\"  \"None whatever. It was suddenly done and finished.\"  \"If there had been a patrol boat about, might it have been of assistance?\"  \"It might, but it is one of those things one never knows.\"  With regard to the threats against his ship, Captain Turner said he saw nothing except what appeared in the New York papers the day before the Lusitania sailed. He had never heard the passengers talking about the threats, he said.  \"Was a warning given to the lower decks after the ship had been struck?\" Captain Turner was asked.  \"All the passengers must have heard the explosion,\" Captain Turner replied.  Captain Turner, in answer to another question, said he received no report from the lookout before the torpedo struck the Lusitania.  Ship\\'s Bugler Livermore testified that the watertight compartments were closed, but that the explosion and the force of the water must have burst them open. He said that all the officers were at their posts and that earlier arrivals of the rescue craft would not have saved the situation.  After physicians had testified that the victims had met death through prolonged immersion and exhaustion the coroner summed up the case.  He said that the first torpedo fired by the German submarine did serious damage to the Lusitania, but that, not satisfied with this, the Germans had discharged another torpedo. The second torpedo, he said, must have been more deadly, because it went right through the ship, hastening the work of destruction.  The characteristic courage of the Irish and British people was manifested at the time of this terrible disaster, the coroner continued, and there was no panic. He charged that the responsibility \"lay on the German Government and the whole people of Germany, who collaborated in the terrible crime.\"  \"I propose to ask the jury,\" he continued, \"to return the only verdict possible for a self-respecting jury, that the men in charge of the German submarine were guilty of wilful murder.\"  The jury then retired and after due deliberation prepared this verdict:   We find that the deceased met death from prolonged immersion and exhaustion in the sea eight miles south-southeast of Old Head of Kinsale, Friday, May 7, 1915, owing to the sinking of the Lusitania by torpedoes fired by a German submarine.  We find that the appalling crime was committed contrary to international law and the conventions of all civilized nations.  We also charge the officers of said submarine and the Emperor and the Government of Germany, under whose orders they acted, with the crime of wholesale murder before the tribunal of the civilized world.  We desire to express sincere condolences and sympathy with the relatives of the deceased, the Cunard Company, and the United States, many of whose citizens perished in this murderous attack on an unarmed liner.  President Wilson\\'s note to Germany, written consequent on the torpedoing of the Lusitania, was dated six days later, showing that time for careful deliberation was duly taken. The President\\'s Secretary, Joseph P. Tumulty, on May 8th, the day following the tragedy, made this statement:   Of course the President feels the distress and the gravity of the situation to the utmost, and is considering very earnestly but very calmly, the right course of action to pursue. He knows that the people of the country wish and expect him to act with deliberation as well as with firmness.   Although signed by Mr. Bryan, as Secretary of State, the note was written by the President in shorthand--a favorite method of Mr. Wilson in making memoranda--and transcribed by him on his own typewriter. The document was presented to the members of the President\\'s Cabinet, a draft of it was sent to Counselor Lansing of the State Department, and after a few minor changes, it was transmitted by cable to Ambassador Gerard in Berlin.   DEPARTMENT OF STATE, WASHINGTON, MAY 13, 1915. The Secretary of State to the American Ambassador at Berlin:  Please call on the Minister of Foreign Affairs and after reading to him this communication leave with him a copy.  In view of recent acts of the German authorities in violation of American rights on the high seas, which culminated in the torpedoing and sinking of the British steamship Lusitania on May 7, 1915, by which over 100 American citizens lost their lives, it is clearly wise and desirable that the Government of the United States and the Imperial German Government should come to a clear and full understanding as to the grave situation which has resulted.  The sinking of the British passenger steamer Falaba by a German submarine on March 28th, through which Leon C. Thrasher, an American citizen, was drowned; the attack on April 28th, on the American vessel Cushing by a German aeroplane; the torpedoing on May 1st of the American vessel Gulflight by a German submarine, as a result of which two or more American citizens met their death; and, finally, the torpedoing and sinking of the steamship Lusitania, constitute a series of events which the Government of the United States has observed with growing concern, distress, and amazement.  Recalling the humane and enlightened attitude hitherto assumed by the Imperial German Government in matters of international right, and particularly with regard to the freedom of the seas; having learned to recognize the German views and the German influence in the field of international obligation as always engaged upon the side of justice and humanity; and having understood the instructions of the Imperial German Government to its naval commanders to be upon the same plane of humane action prescribed by the naval codes of the other nations, the Government of the United States was loath to believe--it cannot now bring itself to believe--that these acts, so absolutely contrary to the rules, the practices, and the spirit of modern warfare, could have the countenance, or sanction of that great government. It feels it to be its duty, therefore, to address the Imperial German Government concerning them with the utmost frankness and in the earnest hope that it is not mistaken in expecting action on the part of the Imperial German Government, which will correct the unfortunate impressions which have been created, and vindicate once more the position of that government with regard to the sacred freedom of the seas.  The Government of the United States has been apprised that the Imperial German Government considered themselves to be obliged by the extraordinary circumstances of the present war and the measure adopted by their adversaries in seeking to cut Germany off from all commerce, to adopt methods of retaliation which go much beyond the ordinary methods of warfare at sea, in the proclamation of a war zone from which they have warned neutral ships to keep away. This government has already taken occasion to inform the Imperial German Government that it cannot admit the adoption of such measures or such a warning of danger to operate as in any degree an abbreviation of the rights of American shipmasters or of American citizens bound on lawful errands as passengers on merchant ships of belligerent nationality, and that it must hold the Imperial German Government to a strict accountability for any infringement of those rights, intentional or incidental. It does not understand the Imperial German Government to question these rights. It assumes, on the contrary, that the Imperial Government accept, as of course, the rule that the lives of noncombatants, whether they be of neutral citizenship or citizens of one of the nations at war, cannot lawfully or rightfully be put in jeopardy by the capture or destruction of an unarmed merchantman, and recognize also, as all other nations do, the obligation to take the usual precaution of visit and search to ascertain whether a suspected merchantman is in fact of belligerent nationality or is in fact carrying contraband of war under a neutral flag.   [Illustration: Photograph]   Copyright Underwood and Underwood. N. Y.   THE LUSITANIA   The sinking of this great liner by a German submarine, with the loss   of more than a thousand lives, caused a thrill of horror throughout   all neutral nations and crystallized public opinion in the United   States into a fierce resentment of German barbarism which indirectly   led to the entry into the World War.   [Illustration]   SUBMARINE HUNTING   A small naval dirigible used for scouting by the British Navy. Under   the cigar-shaped balloon is swung an airplane chassis equipped with   powerful motors and steering apparatus, together with a light gun.   The Government of the United States, therefore, desires to call the attention of the Imperial German Government with the utmost earnestness to the fact that the objection to their present method of attack against the trade of their enemies lies in the practical impossibility of employing submarines in the destruction of commerce without disregarding those rules of fairness, reason, justice, and humanity which all modern opinion regards as imperative. It is practically impossible for the officers of a submarine to visit a merchantman at sea and examine her papers and cargo. It is practically impossible for them to make a prize of her; and, if they cannot put a prize crew on board of her, they cannot sink her without leaving her crew and all on board of her to the mercy of the sea in her small boats. These facts, it is understood, the Imperial German Government frankly admit. We are informed that in the instances of which we have spoken time enough for even that poor measure of safety was not given, and in at least two of the cases cited not so much as a warning was received. Manifestly, submarines cannot be used against merchantmen, as the last few weeks have shown, without an inevitable violation of many sacred principles of justice and humanity.  American citizens act within their indisputable rights in taking their ships and in traveling wherever their legitimate business calls them upon the high seas, and exercise those rights in what should be the well-justified confidence that their lives will not be endangered by acts done in clear violation of universally acknowledged international obligations, and certainly in the confidence that their own government will sustain them in the exercise of their rights.  There was recently published in the newspapers of the United States, I regret to inform the Imperial German Government, a formal warning, purporting to come from the Imperial German Embassy at Washington, addressed to the people of the United States, and stating, in effect, that any citizen of the United States who exercised his right of free travel upon the seas would do so at his peril if his journey should take him within the zone of waters within which the Imperial German Navy was using submarines against the commerce of Great Britain and France, notwithstanding the respectful but very earnest protest of the Government of the United States. I do not refer to this for the purpose of calling the attention of the Imperial German Government at this time to the surprising irregularity of a communication from the Imperial German Embassy at Washington addressed to the people of the United States through the newspapers, but only for the purpose of pointing out that no warning that an unlawful and inhumane act will be committed can possibly be accepted as an excuse or palliation for that act or as an abatement of the responsibility for its commission.  Long acquainted as this government has been with the character of the Imperial Government, and with the high principles of equity by which they have in the past been actuated and guided, the Government of the United States cannot believe that the commanders of the vessels which committed these acts of lawlessness did so except under a misapprehension of the orders issued by the Imperial German naval authorities. It takes for granted that, at least within the practical possibilities of every such case, the commanders even of submarines were expected to do nothing that would involve the lives of noncombatants or the safety of neutral ships, even at the cost of failing of their object of capture or destruction. It confidently expects, therefore, that the Imperial German Government will disavow the acts of which the Government of the United States complains; that they will make reparation so far as reparation is possible for injuries which are without measure, and that they will take immediate steps to prevent the recurrence of anything so obviously subversive of the principles of warfare for which the Imperial German Government have in the past so wisely and so firmly contended.  The government and people of the United States look to the Imperial German Government for just, prompt, and enlightened action in this vital matter with the greater confidence, because the United States and Germany are bound together not only by ties of friendship, but also by the explicit stipulations of the Treaty of 1828, between the United States and the Kingdom of Prussia.  Expressions of regret and offers of reparation in case of the destruction of neutral ships sunk by mistake, while they may satisfy international obligations, if no loss of life results, cannot justify or excuse a practice the natural and necessary effect of which is to subject neutral nations and neutral persons to new and immeasurable risks.  The Imperial German Government will not expect the Government of the United States to omit any word or any act necessary to the performance of its sacred duty of maintaining the rights of the United States and its citizens and of safeguarding their free exercise and enjoyment. BRYAN.   Ex-President Roosevelt, after learning details of the sinking of the Lusitania, made these statements:  \"This represents not merely piracy, but piracy on a vaster scale of murder than old-time pirate ever practiced. This is the warfare which destroyed Louvain and Dinant and hundreds of men, women and children in Belgium. It is a warfare against innocent men, women, and children traveling on the ocean, and our own fellowcountrymen and countrywomen, who were among the sufferers.  \"It seems inconceivable that we can refrain from taking action in this matter, for we owe it not only to humanity, but to our own national self-respect.\"  Former President Taft made this statement:  \"I do not wish to embarrass the President of the Administration by a discussion of the subject at this stage of the information, except to express confidence that the President will follow a wise and patriotic course. We must bear in mind that if we have a war it is the people, the men and women, fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, who must pay with lives and money the cost of it, and therefore they should not be hurried into the sacrifices until it is made clear that they wish it and know what they are doing when they wish it.  \"I agree that the inhumanity of the circumstances in the case now presses us on, but in the heat of even just indignation is this the best time to act, when action involves such momentous consequences and means untold loss of life and treasure? There are things worse than war, but delay, due to calm deliberation, cannot change the situation or minimize the effect of what we finally conclude to do.  \"With the present condition of the war in Europe, our action, if it is to be extreme, will not lose efficiency by giving time to the people, whose war it will be, to know what they are facing.  \"A demand for war that cannot survive the passion of the first days of public indignation and will not endure the test of delay and deliberation by all the people is not one that should be yielded to.\"  President Wilson was criticised later by many persons for not insisting upon a declaration of war immediately after the sinking of the Lusitania. Undoubtedly the advice of former President Taft and of others high in statesmanship, prevailed with the President. This in substance was that America should prepare resolutely and thoroughly, giving Germany in the meantime no excuse for charges that America\\'s entrance into the conflict was for aggression or for selfish purposes.  It was seen even as early as the sinking of the Lusitania that Germany\\'s only hope for final success lay in the submarine. It was reasoned that unrestricted submarine warfare against the shipping of the world, so far as tended toward the provisioning and munitioning of the Allies, would be the inevitable outcome. It was further seen that when that declaration would be made by Germany, America\\'s decision for war must be made. The President and his Cabinet thereupon made all their plans looking toward that eventuality.  The resignation of Mr. Bryan from the Cabinet was followed by the appointment of Robert Lansing as Secretary of State. It was recognized on both sides of the Atlantic that President Wilson in all essential matters affecting the war was active in the preparation of all state papers and in the direction of that department. Another Cabinet vacancy was created when Lindley M. Garrison, of New Jersey, resigned the portfolio of Secretary of War because of a clash upon his militant views for preparedness. Newton D. Baker, of Cleveland, Ohio, a close friend and supporter of President Wilson, was appointed in his stead.    CHAPTER XVII  NEUVE CHAPELLE AND WAR IN BLOOD-SOAKED TRENCHES  After the immortal stand of Joffre at the first battle of the Marne and the sudden savage thrust at the German center which sent von Kluck and his men reeling back in retreat to the prepared defenses along the line of the Aisne, the war in the western theater resolved itself into a play for position from deep intrenchments. Occasionally would come a sudden big push by one side or the other in which artillery was massed until hub touched hub and infantry swept to glory and death in waves of gray, or blue or khaki as the case might be. But these tremendous efforts and consequent slaughters did not change the long battle line from the Alps to the North Sea materially. Here and there a bulge would be made by the terrific pressure of men and material in some great assault like that first push of the British at Neuve Chapelle, like the German attack at Verdun or like the tremendous efforts by both sides on that bloodiest of all battlefields, the Somme.  Neuve Chapelle deserves particular mention as the test in which the British soldiers demonstrated their might in equal contest against the enemy. There had been a disposition in England as elsewhere up to that time to rate the Germans as supermen, to exalt the potency of the scientific equipment with which the German army had taken the field. When the battle of Neuve Chapelle had been fought, although its losses were heavy, there was no longer any doubt in the British nation that victory was only a question of time.  The action came as a pendant to the attack by General de Langle de Cary\\'s French army during February, 1915, at Perthes, that had been a steady relentless pressure by artillery and infantry upon a strong German position. To meet it heavy reinforcements had been shifted by the Germans from the trenches between La Bassee and Lille. The earthworks at Neuve Chapelle had been particularly depleted and only a comparatively small body of Saxons and Bavarians defended them. Opposite this body was the first British army. The German intrenchments at Neuve Chapelle surrounded and defended the highlands upon which were placed the German batteries and in their turn defended the road towards Lille, Roubaix and Turcoing.  The task assigned to Sir John French was to make an assault with only forty-eight thousand men on a comparatively narrow front. There was only one practicable method for effective preparation, and this was chosen by the British general. An artillery concentration absolutely unprecedented up to that time was employed by him. Field pieces firing at point-blank range were used to cut the barbed wire entanglements defending the enemy intrenchments, while howitzers and bombing airplanes were used to drop high explosives into the defenseless earthworks.  Sir Douglas Haig, later to become the commander-in-chief of the British forces, was in command of the first army. Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien commanded the second army. It was the first army that bore the brunt of the attack.  No engagement during the years on the western front was more sudden and surprising in its onset than that drive of the British against Neuve Chapelle. At seven o\\'clock on the morning of Wednesday, March 10, 1915, the British artillery was lazily engaged in lobbing over a desultory shell fire upon the German trenches. It was the usual breakfast appetizer, and nobody on the German side took any unusual notice of it. Really, however, the shelling was scientific \"bracketing\" of the enemy\\'s important position. The gunners were making sure of their ranges.  At 7.30 range finding ended, and with a roar that shook the earth the most destructive and withering artillery action of the war up to that time was on. Field pieces sending their shells hurtling only a few feet above the earth tore the wire emplacements of the enemy to pieces and made kindling wood of the supports. Howitzers sent high explosive shells, containing lyddite, of 15-inch, 9.2-inch and 6-inch caliber into the doomed trenches and later into the ruined village. It was eight o\\'clock in the morning, one-half hour after the beginning of the artillery action, that the village was bombarded. During this time British soldiers were enabled to walk about in No Man\\'s Land behind the curtain of fire with absolute immunity. No German rifleman or machine gunner left cover. The scene on the German side of the line was like that upon the blasted surface of the moon, pock-marked with shell holes, and with no trace of human life to be seen above ground.   [Illustration: Map: Neuve Chapelle and surroundings.]   THE BATTLE GROUND OF NEUVE CHAPELLE   An eye witness describing the scene said:  \"The dawn, which broke reluctantly through a veil of clouds on the morning of Wednesday, March 10, 1915, seemed as any other to the Germans behind the white and blue sandbags in their long line of trenches curving in a hemicycle about the battered village of Neuve Chapelle. For five months they had remained undisputed masters of the positions they had here wrested from the British in October. Ensconced in their comfortably-arranged trenches with but a thin outpost in their fire trenches, they had watched day succeed day and night succeed night without the least variation from the monotony of trench warfare, the intermittent bark of the machine guns--rat-tat-tat-tat-tat--and the perpetual rattle of rifle fire, with here and there a bomb, and now and then an exploded mine.  \"For weeks past the German airmen had grown strangely shy. On this Wednesday morning none were aloft to spy out the strange doings which, as dawn broke, might have been descried on the desolate roads behind the British lines.  \"From ten o\\'clock of the preceding evening endless files of men marched silently down the roads leading towards the German positions through Laventie and Richebourg St. Vaast, poor shattered villages of the dead where months of incessant bombardment have driven away the last inhabitants and left roofless houses and rent roadways....  \"Two days before, a quiet room, where Nelson\\'s Prayer stands on the mantel-shelf, saw the ripening of the plans that sent these sturdy sons of Britain\\'s four kingdoms marching all through the night. Sir John French met the army corps commanders and unfolded to them his plans for the offensive of the British army against the German line at Neuve Chapelle.  \"The onslaught was to be a surprise. That was its essence. The Germans were to be battered with artillery, then rushed before they recovered their wits. We had thirty-six clear hours before us. Thus long, it was reckoned (with complete accuracy as afterwards appeared), must elapse before the Germans, whose line before us had been weakened, could rush up reinforcements. To ensure the enemy\\'s being pinned down right and left of the \\'great push,\\' an attack was to be delivered north and south of the main thrust simultaneously with the assault on Neuve Chapelle.\"    [Illustration: Map bounded by Armentieres on the North, Lille on the East, Estaires on the West and Carvin on the South.]   MAP OF THE BATTLE FRONT BETWEEN ARMENTIERES AND LA BASSEE   On the left, half way up the map, may be seen Neuve Chapelle; a little   to the right of it is Aubers, where some of the sternest fighting   occurred.   After describing the impatience of the British soldiers as they awaited the signal to open the attack, and the actual beginning of the engagement, the narrator continues:  \"Then hell broke loose. With a mighty, hideous, screeching burst of noise, hundreds of guns spoke. The men in the front trenches were deafened by the sharp reports of the field-guns spitting out their shells at close range to cut through the Germans\\' barbed wire entanglements. In some cases the trajectory of these vicious missiles was so flat that they passed only a few feet above the British trenches.  \"The din was continuous. An officer who had the curious idea of putting his ear to the ground said it was as though the earth were being smitten great blows with a Titan\\'s hammer. After the first few shells had plunged screaming amid clouds of earth and dust into the German trenches, a dense pall of smoke hung over the German lines. The sickening fumes of lyddite blew back into the British trenches. In some places the troops were smothered in earth and dust or even spattered with blood from the hideous fragments of human bodies that went hurtling through the air. At one point the upper half of a German officer, his cap crammed on his head, was blown into one of our trenches.  \"Words will never convey any adequate idea of the horror of those five and thirty minutes. When the hands of officers\\' watches pointed to five minutes past eight, whistles resounded along the British lines. At the same moment the shells began to burst farther ahead, for, by previous arrangement, the gunners, lengthening their fuses, were \\'lifting\\' on to the village of Neuve Chapelle so as to leave the road open for our infantry to rush in and finish what the guns had begun.  \"The shells were now falling thick among the houses of Neuve Chapelle, a confused mass of buildings seen reddish through the pillars of smoke and flying earth and dust. At the sound of the whistle--alas for the bugle, once the herald of victory, now banished from the fray!--our men scrambled out of the trenches and hurried higgledy-piggledy into the open. Their officers were in front. Many, wearing overcoats and carrying rifles with fixed bayonets, closely resembled their men.  \"It was from the center of our attacking line that the assault was pressed home soonest. The guns had done their work well. The trenches were blown to irrecognizable pits dotted with dead. The barbed wire had been cut like so much twine. Starting from the Rue Tilleloy the Lincolns and the Berkshires were off the mark first, with orders to swerve to right and left respectively as soon as they had captured the first line of trenches, in order to let the Royal Irish Rifles and the Rifle Brigade through to the village. The Germans left alive in the trenches, half demented with fright, surrounded by a welter of dead and dying men, mostly surrendered. The Berkshires were opposed with the utmost gallantry by two German officers who had remained alone in a trench serving a machine gun. But the lads from Berkshire made their way into that trench and bayoneted the Germans where they stood, fighting to the last. The Lincolns, against desperate resistance, eventually occupied their section of the trench and then waited for the Irishmen and the Rifle Brigade to come and take the village ahead of them. Meanwhile the second Thirty-ninth Garhwalis on the right had taken their trenches with a rush and were away towards the village and the Biez Wood.  \"Things had moved so fast that by the time the troops were ready to advance against the village the artillery had not finished its work. So, while the Lincolns and the Berks assembled the prisoners who were trooping out of the trenches in all directions, the infantry on whom devolved the honor of capturing the village, waited. One saw them standing out in the open, laughing and cracking jokes amid the terrific din made by the huge howitzer shells screeching overhead and bursting in the village, the rattle of machine guns all along the line, and the popping of rifles. Over to the right where the Garhwalis had been working with the bayonet, men were shouting hoarsely and wounded were groaning as the stretcher-bearers, all heedless of bullets, moved swiftly to and fro over the shell-torn ground.  \"There was bloody work in the village of Neuve Chapelle. The capture of a place at the bayonet point is generally a grim business, in which instant, unconditional surrender is the only means by which bloodshed, a deal of bloodshed, can be prevented. If there is individual resistance here and there the attacking troops cannot discriminate. They must go through, slaying as they go such as oppose them (the Germans have a monopoly of the finishing-off of wounded men), otherwise the enemy\\'s resistance would not be broken, and the assailants would be sniped and enfiladed from hastily prepared strongholds at half a dozen different points.  \"The village was a sight that the men say they will never forget. It looked as if an earthquake had struck it. The published photographs do not give any idea of the indescribable mass of ruins to which our guns reduced it. The chaos is so utter that the very line of the streets is all but obliterated.  \"It was indeed a scene of desolation into which the Rifle Brigade--the first regiment to enter the village, I believe--raced headlong. Of the church only the bare shell remained, the interior lost to view beneath a gigantic mound of debris. The little churchyard was devastated, the very dead plucked from their graves, broken coffins and ancient bones scattered about amid the fresher dead, the slain of that morning-- gray-green forms asprawl athwart the tombs. Of all that once fair village but two things remained intact--two great crucifixes reared aloft, one in the churchyard, the other over against the chateau. From the cross, that is the emblem of our faith, the figure of Christ, yet intact though all pitted with bullet marks, looked down in mute agony on the slain in the village.  \"The din and confusion were indescribable. Through the thick pall of shell smoke Germans were seen on all sides, some emerging half dazed from cellars and dugouts, their hands above their heads, others dodging round the shattered houses, others firing from the windows, from behind carts, even from behind the overturned tombstones. Machine guns were firing from the houses on the outskirts, rapping out their nerve-racking note above the noise of the rifles.  \"Just outside the village there was a scene of tremendous enthusiasm. The Rifle Brigade, smeared with dust and blood, fell in with the Third Gurkhas with whom they had been brigaded in India. The little brown men were dirty but radiant. Kukri in hand they had very thoroughly gone through some houses at the cross-roads on the Rue du Bois and silenced a party of Germans who were making themselves a nuisance there with some machine guns. Riflemen and Gurkhas cheered themselves hoarse.\"   [Illustration: Map:  Bapaume on the North, Albert on the West, Rosieres and Chaulnes on the South and Peronne on the East.]   SCENE OF THE BLOODY BATTLES OF THE SOMME   The tide of war swept over this terrain with terrific violence.   Peronne was taken by the British in their great offensives of 1916-17;   in the last desperate effort of the Germans in 1918 they plunged   through Peronne advancing 35 miles, only to be hurled back with awful   losses by Marshal Foch. The town of Albert was taken and retaken   several times.   Unfortunately for the complete success of the brilliant attack a great delay was caused by the failure of the artillery that was to have cleared the barbed wire entanglements for the Twenty-third Brigade, and because of the unlooked for destruction of the British field telephone system by shell and rifle fire. The check of the Twenty-third Brigade banked other commands back of it, and the Twenty-fifth Brigade was obliged to fight at right angles to the line of battle. The Germans quickly rallied at these points, and took a terrific toll in British lives. Particularly was this true at three specially strong German positions. One called Port Arthur by the British, another at Pietre Mill and the third was the fortified bridge over Des Layes Creek.  Because of the lack of telephone communication it was impossible to send reinforcements to the troops that had been held up by barbed wire and other emplacements and upon which German machine guns were pouring a steady stream of death.  As the Twenty-third Brigade had been held up by unbroken barbed wire northwest of Neuve Chapelle, so the Seventh Division of the Fourth Corps was also checked in its action against the ridge of Aubers on the left of Neuve Chapelle. Under the plan of Sir Douglas Haig the Seventh Division was to have waited until the Eighth Division had reached Neuve Chapelle, when it was to charge through Aubers. With the tragic mistake that cost the Twenty-third Brigade so dearly, the plan affecting the Seventh Division went awry. The German artillery, observing the concentration of the Seventh Division opposite Aubers, opened a vigorous fire upon that front. During the afternoon General Haig ordered a charge upon the German positions. The advance was made in short rushes in the face of a fire that seemed to blaze from an inferno. Inch by inch the ground was drenched with British blood. At 5.30 in the afternoon the men dug themselves in under the relentless German fire. Further advance became impossible.  The night was one of horror. Every minute the men were under heavy bombardment. At dawn on March 11th the dauntless British infantry rushed from the trenches in an effort to carry Aubers, but the enemy artillery now greatly reinforced made that task an impossible one. The trenches occupied by the British forces were consolidated and the salient made by the push was held by the British with bulldog tenacity.  The number of men employed in the action on the British side was forty-eight thousand. During the early surprise of the action the loss was slight. Had the wire in front of the Twenty-third Brigade been cut by the artillery assigned to such action, and had the telephone system not been destroyed the success of the thrust would have been complete. The delay of four and a half hours between the first and second phases of the attack caused virtually all the losses sustained by the attacking force. The total casualties were 12,811 men of the British forces. Of these 1,751 officers and privates were taken prisoners and 10,000 officers and men were killed and wounded.  The action continued throughout Thursday, March 11th, with little change in the general situation. The British still held Neuve Chapelle and their intrenchments threatened Aubers. On Friday morning, March 12th, the Crown Prince of Bavaria made a desperate attempt under cover of a heavy fog to recapture the village. The effort was made in characteristic German dense formations. The Westphalian and Bavarian troops came out of Biez Wood in waves of gray-green, only to be blown to pieces by British guns already loaded and laid on the mark. Elsewhere the British waited until the Germans were scarcely more than fifty paces away when they opened with deadly rapid fire before which the German waves melted like snow before steam. It was such slaughter as the British had experienced when held up before Aubers. Slaughter that staggered Germany.  So ended Neuve Chapelle, a battle in which the decision rested with the British, a victory for which a fearful price had been paid but out of which came a confidence that was to hearten the British nation and to put sinews of steel into the British army for the dread days to come.  The story of Neuve Chapelle was repeated in large and in miniature many times during the deadlock of trench warfare on the western front until victory finally came to the Allies. During those years the western battle front lay like a wounded snake across France and Belgium. It writhed and twisted, now this way, now that, as one side or the other gambled with men and shells and airplanes for some brief advantage. It bent back in a great bulge when von Hindenburg made his famous retreat in the winter of 1916 after the Allies had pressed heavily against the Teutonic front upon the ghastly field of the Somme. The record is one of great value to military strategists, to the layman it is only a succession of artillery barrages, of gas attacks, of aerial reconnaissances and combats.  One day grew to be very much like another in that deadlock of pythons. A play for position here was met by a counter-thrust in another place. German inventions were out-matched and outnumbered by those coming from the Allied side.  Trench warfare became the daily life of the men. They learned to fight and live in the open. The power of human adaptation to abnormal conditions was never better exemplified than in those weary, dreary years on the western front.  The fighting-lines consisted generally of one, two, or three lines of shelter-trenches lying parallel, measuring twenty or twenty-five inches in width, and varying in length according to the number they hold; the trenches were joined together by zigzag approaches and by a line of reinforced trenches (armed with machine guns), which were almost completely proof against rifle, machine gun, or gun fire. The ordinary German trenches were almost invisible from 350 yards away, a distance which permitted a very deadly fire. It is easy to realize that if the enemy occupied three successive lines and a line of reinforced intrenchments, the attacking line was likely, at the lowest estimate, to be decimated during an advance of 350 yards--by rifle fire at a range of 350 yards\\' distance, and by the extremely quick fire of the machine guns, each of which delivered from 300 to 600 bullets a minute with absolute precision. In the field-trench, a soldier enjoyed far greater security than he would if merely prone behind his knapsack in an excavation barely fifteen inches deep. He had merely to stoop down a little to disappear below the level of the ground and be immune from infantry fire; moreover, his machine guns fired without endangering him. In addition, this stooping position brought the man\\'s knapsack on a level with his helmet, thus forming some protection against shrapnel and shell-splinters.  At the back of the German trenches shelters were dug for non-commissioned officers and for the commander of the unit.   [Illustration: Painting: Several planes flying over troops in a demolished town.]   THE STRUGGLE FOR ARMENTIERES   Allied forces holding up a German attack on the Lys Canal. Airplanes   flying low peppered the Germans with machine guns and broke up their   concentrations, aiding greatly in the severe repulse of the attacking   Huns.   [Illustration: Painting]   AFTER A DRIVE ON THE SOMME   British advancing over the captured German trenches, after heavy   artillery fire had reduced them to tangled ruins and crushed their   powers of resistance.   Ever since the outbreak of the war, the French troops in Lorraine, after severe experiences, realized rapidly the advantages of the German trenches, and began to study those they had taken gloriously. Officers, non-commissioned officers, and men of the engineers were straightway detached in every unit to teach the infantry how to construct similar shelters. The education was quick, and very soon they had completed the work necessary for the protection of all. The tools of the enemy \"casualties,\" the spades and picks left behind in deserted villages, were all gladly piled on to the French soldiers\\' knapsacks, to be carried willingly by the very men who used to grumble at being loaded with even the smallest regulation tool. As soon as night had set in on the occasion of a lull in the fighting, the digging of the trenches was begun. Sometimes, in the darkness, the men of each fighting nation--less than 500 yards away from their enemy--would hear the noise of the workers of the foe: the sounds of picks and axes; the officers\\' words of encouragement; and tacitly they would agree to an armistice during which to dig shelters from which, in the morning, they would dash out, to fight once more.  Commodious, indeed, were some of the trench barracks. One French soldier wrote:  \"In really up-to-date intrenchments you may find kitchens, dining-rooms, bedrooms, and even stables. One regiment has first class cow-sheds. One day a whimsical \\'piou-piou,\\' finding a cow wandering about in the danger zone, had the bright idea of finding shelter for it in the trenches. The example was quickly followed, and at this moment the ----th Infantry possess an underground farm, in which fat kine, well cared for, give such quantities of milk that regular distributions of butter are being made--and very good butter, too.\"  But this is not all. An officer writes home a tale of yet another one of the comforts of home added to the equipment of the trenches:  \"We are clean people here. Thanks to the ingenuity of ----, we are able to take a warm bath every day from ten to twelve. We call this teasing the \\'bosches,\\' for this bathing-establishment of the latest type is fitted up--would you believe it?--in the trenches!\"    CHAPTER XVIII  STEADFAST SOUTH AFRICA  When Germany struck at the heart of France through Belgium simultaneous action was undertaken by the German Command in Southwest Africa through propaganda and mobilization of the available German troops. Insidiously and by the use of money systematic propaganda was instituted to corrupt the Boers against their allegiance to the Union of South Africa. One great character stood like a rock against all their efforts. It was the character of General Louis Botha, formerly arrayed in battle against the British during the Boer uprising.  With characteristic determination he formulated plans for the invasion of German Southwest Africa without asking permission of the citizens of the South African Union or of the British Foreign Office. His vision comprehended an invasion that would have as its culmination a British-Boer colony where the German colony had been, and that from Cable Bay to the source of the Nile there would be one mighty union, with a great trunk railway feeding Egypt, the Soudan, Rhodesia, Uganda, and the Union of South Africa. An able lieutenant to Botha was General Smuts. He co-operated with his chief in a campaign of education. They pointed out the absolute necessity for deafness to the German tempters, and succeeded in obtaining full co-operation for the Botha plan of invasion from the British Imperial Government and the South African Union. Concerning this agreement General Botha said:  \"To forget their loyalty to the empire in this hour of trial would be scandalous and shameful, and would blacken South Africa in the eyes of the whole world. Of this South Africans were incapable. They had endured some of the greatest sacrifices that could be demanded of a people, but they had always kept before them ideals, founded on Christianity, and never in their darkest days had they sought to gain their ends by treasonable means. The path of treason was an unknown path to Dutch and English alike.  \"Their duty and their conscience alike bade them be faithful and true to the Imperial Government in all respects in this hour of darkness and trouble. That was the attitude of the Union Government; that was the attitude of the people of South Africa. The government had cabled to the Imperial Government at the outbreak of war, offering to undertake the defense of South Africa, thereby releasing the Imperial troops for service elsewhere. This was accepted, and the Union Defense Force was mobilized.\"  Preliminary to the invasion of German Southwest Africa, General Botha proclaimed martial law throughout the Union. The first act in consequence of this proclamation was the arrest of a number of conspirators who were planning sedition throughout the Union. The head of this conspiracy was Lieutenant-Colonel S. G. Maritz. General Beyers and General De Wet, both Boer officers of high standing, co-operated with Maritz in an abortive rebellion. The situation was most trying for the native Boers and, to their credit be it recorded, the great majority of them stood out strongly against the Germans. Vigorous action by Botha and Smuts smashed the rebellion in the fall of 1914. A force acting under General Botha in person attacked the troops under General Beyers at Rustemburg on October 27th, and on the next day General Beyers sought refuge in flight. A smaller force acting under General Kemp was also routed on November 5th.  General De Wet opened his campaign of rebellion on November 7th in an action at Wimburg, where he defeated a smaller force of Loyalists under General Cronje. The decisive battle at Marquard occurred on November 12th, Botha commanding the Loyalists forces in person and De Wet the rebels. The victory of Botha in this fierce engagement was complete. De Wet was routed and was captured on December 1st with a rear-guard of fifty-two men. General Beyers was drowned on December 9th while attempting to escape from the Vall into the Transvaal. This virtually ended all opposition to General Botha. The invasion of German Southwest Africa began on January 5, 1915, and was one uninterrupted chapter of successes. Through jungle and swamp, swept by torrential rains and encountering obstacles that would have disheartened any but the stoutest heart, the little force of invasion swept forward. Most of the engagements by the enemy were in the nature of guerrilla and rear-guard actions. The backbone of the German command was broken and the remaining forces capitulated in July, 1915.  With the capitulation came the story of the German mismanagement in Southwest Africa, and particularly their horrible treatment of the Hereros and Hottentots in the country misgoverned by them. An official report fully authenticated was made and none of its essential details were refuted.  The report told the story of how the German authorities exterminated the native Hereros. When Germany annexed the country in 1890 they were believed to possess well over 150,000 head of cattle. After the rinderpest scourge of 1897 they still owned something like 90,000 head. By 1902, less than ten years after the arrival of the first German settlers, the Hereros had only 45,898 head of cattle, while the 1,051 German traders and farmers then in the country owned 44,487. The policy of robbing and killing the natives had by that time received the sanction of Berlin. By the end of 1905 the surviving Hereros had been reduced to pauperism and possessed nothing at all. In 1907 the Imperial German Government by ordinance prohibited the natives of Southwest Africa from possessing live stock.  The wholesale theft of the natives\\' cattle, their only wealth, with the direct connivance and approval of the Berlin Government, was one of the primary causes of the Herero rebellion of 1904. The revolt was suppressed with characteristic German ruthlessness. But the Germans were not content with a mere suppression of the rising; they had decided upon the practical extinction of the whole tribe. For this purpose Leutwein, who was apparently regarded as too lenient, was superseded by von Trotha, noted for his merciless severity. He had played a notorious part in the Chinese Boxer rebellion, and had just suppressed the Arab rising in German East Africa by the wholesale massacre of men, women, and children. As a preliminary von Trotha invited the Herero chiefs to come in and make peace, \"as the war was now over,\" and promptly shot them in cold blood. Then he issued his notorious \"extermination order,\" in terms of which no Herero--man, woman, child, or babe--was to receive mercy or quarter. \"Kill every one of them,\" he said, \"and take no prisoners.\"  The hanging of natives was a common occurrence. A German officer had the right to order a native to be hanged. No trial or court was necessary. Many were hanged merely on suspicion.  The Hereros were far more humane in the field than the Germans. They were once a fine race. Now there is only a miserable remnant left.  This is amply proved by official German statistics. Out of between 80,000 and 90,000 souls, only about 15,000 starving and fugitive Hereros were alive at the end of 1905, when von Trotha relinquished his task. In 1911, after all rebellions had been suppressed and tranquillity restored, the government had a census taken. The figures, reproduced below, speak for themselves:                  Estimate   Official Census                   1904         1911                                             Decrease   Hereros        80,000      15,130          64,870   Hottentots     20,000       9,781          10,219   Berg-Damaras   30,000      12,831          17,169                 -------      ------          ------                 130,000      37,742          92,258  In other words, eighty per cent of the Herero people disappeared, and more than half of the Hottentot and Berg-Damara races shared the same fate. Dr. Paul Rohrbach\\'s dictum, \"It is applicable to a nation in the same way as to the individual that the right of existence is primarily justified in the degree that such existence is useful for progress and general development,\" comes forcible to mind. These natives of Southwest Africa had been, weighed in the German balance and had been found wanting.  Germany lost more than a million square miles of territory in Africa as a direct consequence of General Botha\\'s bold action. These are divided in four great regions, Southwest Africa, Kamerun, Togo and East Africa. Togoland as this region is popularly known extends from the north shore of the Gulf of Guinea into the interior and is bounded by French and British colonies. By a joint attack of French and British forces, beginning the second week in August, 1914, the German power in this rich domain was completely broken, and the conquest of Togoland was complete on August 26, 1914. The military operation was of a desultory nature, and the losses negligible in view of the area of 33,000 square miles of highly productive land passed from German control.  The fighting in the great region of Kamerun was somewhat more stubborn than that in Togoland. The villages of Bonaberi and Duala were particularly well defended. The British and French fought through swamps and jungle under the handicap of terrific heat, and always with victory at the end of the engagement. The conquest of the Kamerun was complete by the end of June, 1915. In addition to the operations by the British and French a combined Belgian and French force captured Molundu and Ngaundera in the German Congo.  The raids by General Botha on German Southwest Africa, commenced on September 27, 1914. A series of brilliant strategic actions resulted in the conquest of a region once and a half the size of the German Empire at the time the Great War began. A British description of the operation states:  The occupation of Windhoek was effected by General Botha\\'s North Damaraland forces working along the railway from Swakopmund. At the former place General Vanderventer joined up with General Botha\\'s forces. The force from Swakopmund met with considerable opposition, first at Tretskopje, a small township in the great Namib Desert fifty miles to the northeast of Swakopmund, and secondly at Otjimbingwe, on the Swakop River, sixty miles northwest of Windhoek. Apart from these two determined stands, however, little other opposition was encountered, and Karibib was occupied on May 5th and Okahandja and Windhoek on May 12th. With the fall of the latter place, 3,000 Europeans and 12,000 natives became prisoners.  The wireless station--one of Germany\\'s most valuable high-power stations, which was able to communicate with one relay only, with Berlin--was captured almost intact, and much rolling stock also fell into the hands of the Union forces.  The advance from the south along the Luderitzbucht-Seeheim-Keetmanshoop Railway, approximately 500 miles in length, was made by two forces which joined hands at Keetmanshoop. The advance from Aus (captured on April 10th) was made by General Smuts\\'s forces. Colonel (afterward General) Vanderventer, moving up from the direction of Warmbad and Kalkfontein, around the flanks of Karas Mountain, pushed on after reaching Keetmanshoop in the direction of Gibeon. Bethany had previously been occupied during the advance to Seeheim. At Kabus, twenty miles to the north of Keetmanshoop, and at Gibeon pitched battles were fought between General Vanderventer\\'s forces and the enemy. No other opposition of importance was encountered, and the operations were brought to a successful conclusion.  The stiffest fighting in all Africa came in German East Africa. It began in late September, 1914, and continued until mid-June, 1915. The Germans, curiously enough, commenced the offensive here with an attack upon Monbasa, the terminus of the Uganda railway and the capital of British East Africa. The attack was planned as a joint naval and military operation, the German cruiser Koenigsburg being assigned to move into the harbor and bombard the town simultaneously with the assault by land. The plan went awry when the presence of British warships frightened off the Koenigsburg. The land attack was easily checked by a detachment of the King\\'s African Rifles and native Arabian troops until the detachments of Indian Regulars arrived upon the scene. The enemy thereupon retreated to his original plans.  British reprisals came early in November, when the towns of Tanga and Gassin were attacked by British troops. The troops selected for this adventure numbered 6,000 and carried only food, water, guns and munitions. No protection of any kind nor any other equipment was taken by the soldiers. Reinforcements to the German forces delayed the capture of Gassin until January. A garrison of three hundred men was left there and this in turn was besieged by three thousand Germans. After a stubborn defense the Germans recaptured the town. A union of two British forces was accomplished early in June, 1915. One of these cut through German East Africa along the Kagera River and the other advanced on steamers from Kisumu. They met the enemy on June 22d and defeated it with heavy casualties. Later General Tighe, commanding the combined British forces, was congratulated on the completeness of his victory on June 28th, by General Kitchener.  The territory acquired by the British as a consequence of the invasion of Germany\\'s African possessions, possesses formidable natural barriers, but once these are past the traveller finds lands of wonderful fertility and great natural resources. Approaching German Southwest Africa from the east access is across the Kalahari Desert. This in its trackless desolation, its frequent sandstorms and torrid heat through which only the hardiest and best provisioned caravans may penetrate is worse than the worst that Sahara can show. There is not a sign of life. Approached from the sea the principal port is Walfish Bay, a fair harbor that was improved by the British when they occupied it. Near Walfish some of the largest diamonds in the history of the world have been found and gold fields of considerable richness have been worked. The climate of German Southwest Africa, after the torrential storms of the seacoast and the terrific heat of the desert have been passed, is one of the most salubrious in the world. It is unique among African regions in the opportunities it affords for colonization by white men. Great Britain possessed large holdings of this land before Germany came into possession, but abandoned them under the belief that the region was comparatively worthless. There was no misapprehension on this score when all of the lands came into the possession of England as the result of the war.    CHAPTER XIX  ITALY DECLARES WAR ON AUSTRIA  For many years before the great war began the great powers of Europe were divided into two great alliances, the Triple Entente, composed of Russia, France and England, and the Triple Alliance, composed of Germany, Austria and Italy. When the war began Italy refused to join with Germany and Austria. Why? The answer to this question throws a vivid light on the origin of the war.  Italy was a member of the Triple Alliance; she knew the facts, not only what was given to the public, but the inside facts. According to the terms of the alliance each member was bound to stand by each other only in case of attack. Italy refused to join with Austria and Germany because they were the aggressors. The constant assertions of the German statesmen, and of the Kaiser himself, that war had been forced upon them were declared untrue by their associate Italy in the very beginning, and the verdict of Italy was the verdict of the world. Not much was said in the beginning about Italy\\'s abstention from war. The Germans, indeed, sneered a little and hinted that some day Italy would be made to regret her course, but now that the Teuton snake is scotched the importance of Italy\\'s action has been perceived and appraised at its true value.  The Germans from the very beginning understood the real danger that might come to the Central Powers through Italian action. Every effort was made by the foreign office to keep her neutral. First threats were used, later promises were held out of addition to Italian territory if she would send her troops to Germany\\'s assistance. When this failed the most strenuous efforts were made to keep Italy neutral, and a former German premier, Prince von Bulow, was sent to Italy for this purpose. Socialist leaders, too, were sent from Germany to urge the Italian Socialists to insist upon neutrality.  In July, 1914, the Italian Government was not taken by surprise. They had observed the increase year by year of the German army and of the German fleet. At the end of the Balkan wars they had been asked whether they would agree to an Austrian attack upon Serbia. They had consequently long been deliberating as to what their course should be in case of war, and they had made up their minds that under no circumstances would they aid Germany against England.  Quite independently of her long-standing friendship with England it would be suicide to Italy in her geographical position to enter a war which should permit her coast to be attacked by the English and French navies, and her participation in the Triple Alliance always carried the proviso that it did not bind her to fight England. This was well known in the German foreign office, and, indeed, in France where the writers upon war were reckoning confidently on the withdrawing of Italy from the Triple Alliance, and planning to use the entire forces of France against Germany.  A better understanding of the Italian position will result from a consideration of the origin of the Triple Alliance.  After the war of 1870, Bismarck, perceiving the quick recovery of France, considered the advisability of attacking her again, and, to use his own words, \"bleeding her white.\" He found, however, that if this were attempted France would be joined by Russia and England and he gave up this plan. In order, however, to render France powerless he planned an alliance which should be able to control Europe. A league between Germany, Austria and Russia was his desire, and for some time every opportunity was taken to develop friendship with the Czar. Russia, however, remained cool. Her Pan-Slavonic sympathies were opposed to the interests of Germany. Bismarck, therefore, determined, without losing the friendship of Russia, to persuade Italy to join in the continental combination. Italy, at the time, was the least formidable of the six great powers, but Bismarck foresaw that she could be made good use of in such a combination.  At that time Italy, just after the completion of Italian unity, found herself in great perplexity. Her treatment of the Pope had brought about the hostility of Roman Catholics throughout the world. She feared both France and Austria, who were strong Catholic countries, and hardly knew where to look for friends. The great Italian leader at the time was Francesco Crispi, who, beginning as a Radical and a conspirator, had become a constitutional statesman. Bismarck professed the greatest friendship for Crispi, and gave Crispi to understand that he approved of Italy\\'s aspirations on the Adriatic and in Tunis.  The next year, however, at the Berlin Congress, Italy\\'s interests were ignored, and finally, in 1882, France seized Tunis, to the great indignation of the Italians. It has been shown in more recent times that the French seizure of Tunis was directly due to Bismarck\\'s instigation.  The Italians having been roused to wrath, Bismarck proceeded to offer them a place in the councils of the Triple Alliance. It was an easy argument that such an alliance would protect them against France, and no doubt it was promised that it would free them from the danger of attack by Austria. England, at the time, was isolated, and Italy continued on the best understanding with her.  The immediate result of the alliance was a growth of Italian hostility toward France, which led, in 1889, to a tariff war on France. Meanwhile German commercial and financial enterprises were pushed throughout the Italian peninsula. What did Italy gain by this? Her commerce was weakened, and Austria permitted herself every possible unfriendly act except open war.  As time went on Germany and Austria became more and more arrogant. Italy\\'s ambitions on the Balkan peninsula were absolutely ignored. In 1908 Austria appropriated Bosnia and Herzegovina, another blow to Italy. By this time Italy understood the situation well, and that same year, seeing no future for herself in Europe, she swooped down on Tripoli. In doing this she forestalled Germany herself, for Germany had determined to seize Tripoli.  Both Germany and Austria were opposed to this action of Italy, but Italy\\'s eyes were now open. Thirty years of political alliance had created no sympathy among the Italians for the Germans. Moreover, it was not entirely a question of policy. The lordly arrogance of the Prussians caused sharp antagonism. The Italians were lovers of liberty; the Germans pledged toward autocracy. They found greater sympathy in England and in France.  \"I am a son of liberty,\" said Cavour, \"to her I owe all that I am.\" That, too, is Italy\\'s motto. When the war broke out popular sympathy in Italy was therefore strongly in favor of the Allies. The party in power, the Liberals, adopted the policy of neutrality for the time being, but thousands of Italians volunteered for the French and British service, and the anti-German feeling grew greater as time went on.  Finally, on the 23rd of May, 1915, the Italian Government withdrew its ambassador to Austria and declared war. A complete statement of the negotiations between Italy and Austria-Hungary, which led to this declaration, was delivered to the Government of the United States by the Italian Ambassador on May 25th. This statement, of which the following is an extract, lucidly presented the Italian position:  \"The Triple Alliance was essentially defensive, and designed solely to preserve the status quo, or in other words equilibrium, in Europe. That these were its only objects and purposes is established by the letter and spirit of the treaty, as well as by the intentions clearly described and set forth in official acts of the ministers who created the alliance and confirmed and renewed it in the interests of peace, which always has inspired Italian policy. The treaty, as long as its intents and purposes had been loyally interpreted and regarded, and as long as it had not been used as a pretext for aggression against others, greatly contributed to the elimination and settlement of causes of conflict, and for many years assured to Europe the inestimable benefits of peace. But Austria-Hungary severed the treaty by her own hands. She rejected the response of Serbia which gave to her all the satisfaction she could legitimately claim. She refused to listen to the conciliatory proposals presented by Italy in conjunction with other powers in the effort to spare Europe from a vast conflict, certain to drench the Continent with blood and to reduce it to ruin beyond the conception of human imagination, and finally she provoked that conflict.  \"Article first of the treaty embodied the usual and necessary obligation of such pacts--the pledge to exchange views upon any fact and economic questions of a general nature that might arise pursuant to its terms. None of the contracting parties had the right to undertake without a previous agreement any step the consequence of which might impose a duty upon the other signatories arising under the alliance, or which would in any way whatsoever encroach upon their vital interests. This article was violated by Austria-Hungary, when she sent to Serbia her note dated July 23, 1914, an action taken without the previous assent of Italy. Thus, Austria-Hungary violated beyond doubt one of the fundamental provisions of the treaty. The obligation of Austria-Hungary to come to a previous understanding with Italy was the greater because her obstinate policy against Serbia gave rise to a situation which directly tended toward the provocation of a European war.  \"As far back as the beginning of July, 1914, the Italian Government, preoccupied by the prevailing feeling in Vienna, caused to be laid before the Austro-Hungarian Government a number of suggestions advising moderation, and warning it of the impending danger of a European outbreak. The course adopted by Austria-Hungary against Serbia constituted, moreover, a direct encroachment upon the general interests of Italy both political and economical in the Balkan peninsula. Austria-Hungary could not for a moment imagine that Italy could remain indifferent while Serbian independence was being trodden upon. On a number of occasions theretofore, Italy gave Austria to understand, in friendly but clear terms, that the independence of Serbia was considered by Italy as essential to the Balkan equilibrium. Austria-Hungary was further advised that Italy could never permit that equilibrium to be disturbed through a prejudice. This warning had been conveyed not only by her diplomats in private conversations with responsible Austro-Hungarian officials, but was proclaimed publicly by Italian statesmen on the floors of Parliament.  \"Therefore, when Austria-Hungary ignored the usual practices and menaced Serbia by sending her an ultimatum, without in any way notifying the Italian Government of what she proposed to do, indeed leaving that government to learn of her action through the press, rather than through the usual channels of diplomacy, when Austria-Hungary took this unprecedented course she not only severed her alliance with Italy but committed an act inimical to Italy\\'s interests....  \"After the European war broke out Italy sought to come to an understanding with Austria-Hungary with a view to a settlement satisfactory to both parties which might avert existing and future trouble. Her efforts were in vain, notwithstanding the efforts of Germany, which for months endeavored to induce Austria-Hungary to comply with Italy\\'s suggestion thereby recognizing the propriety and legitimacy of the Italian attitude. Therefore Italy found herself compelled by the force of events to seek other solutions.  \"Inasmuch as the treaty of alliance with Austria-Hungary had ceased virtually to exist and served only to prolong a state of continual friction and mutual suspicion, the Italian Ambassador at Vienna was instructed to declare to the Austro-Hungarian Government that the Italian Government considered itself free from the ties arising out of the treaty of the Triple Alliance in so far as Austria-Hungary was concerned. This communication was delivered in Vienna on May 4th.  \"Subsequently to this declaration, and after we had been obliged to take steps for the protection of our interests, the Austro-Hungarian Government submitted new concessions, which, however, were deemed insufficient and by no means met our minimum demands. These offers could not be considered under the circumstances. The Italian Government taking into consideration what has been stated above, and supported by the vote of Parliament and the solemn manifestation of the country came to the decision that any further delay would be inadvisable. Therefore, on May 23d, it was declared, in the name of the King, to the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador at Rome, that, beginning the following day, May 24th, it would consider itself in a state of war with Austria-Hungary.\"  It was a closely reasoned argument that the Italian statesmen presented, but there was something more than reasoned argument in Italy\\'s course. She had been waiting for years for the opportunity to bring under her flag the men of her own race still held in subjection by hated Austria. Now was the time or never. Her people had become roused. Mobs filled the streets. Great orators, even the great poet, D\\'Annunzio, proclaimed a holy war. The sinking of the Lusitania poured oil on the flames, and the treatment of Belgium and eastern France added to the fury.  Italian statesmen, even if they had so desired, could not have withstood the pressure. It was a crusade for Italia Irredenta, for civilization, for humanity. The country had been flooded by representatives of German propaganda, papers had been hired and, by all report, money in large amounts distributed. But every German effort was swept away in the flood of feeling. It was the people\\'s war.  Amid tremendous enthusiasm the Chamber of Deputies adopted by vote of 407 to 74 the bill conferring upon the government full power to make war. All members of the Cabinet maintained absolute silence regarding what step should follow the action of the chamber. When the chamber reassembled on May 20th, after its long recess, there were present 482 Deputies out of 500, the absentees remaining away on account of illness. The Deputies especially applauded were those who wore military uniforms and who had asked permission for leave from their military duties to be present at the sitting. All the tribunes were filled to overflowing. No representatives of Germany, Austria or Turkey were to be seen in the diplomatic tribune. The first envoy to arrive was Thomas Nelson Page, the American Ambassador, who was accompanied by his staff. M. Barrere, Sir J. Bennell Rodd, and Michel de Giers, the French, British and Russian Ambassadors, respectively, appeared a few minutes later and all were greeted with applause, which was shared by the Belgian, Greek and Roumanian ministers. George B. McClellan, one-time mayor of New York, occupied a seat in the President\\'s tribune.  A few minutes before the session began the poet, Gabrielle D\\'Annunzio, one of the strongest advocates of war, appeared in the rear of the public tribune which was so crowded that it seemed impossible to squeeze in anybody else. But the moment the people saw him they lifted him shoulder high and passed him over their heads to the first row.  The entire chamber, and all those occupying the other tribunes, rose and applauded for five minutes, crying \"Viva D\\'Annunzio!\" Later thousands sent him their cards and in return received his autograph bearing the date of this eventful day. Senor Marcora, President of the Chamber, took his place at three o\\'clock. All the members of the House, and everybody in the galleries, stood up to acclaim the old follower of Garibaldi. Premier Salandra, followed by all the members of the Cabinet, entered shortly afterward. It was a solemn moment. Then a delirium of cries broke out.  \"Viva Salandra!\" roared the Deputies, and the cheering lasted for a long time. After the formalities of the opening, Premier Salandra, deeply moved by the demonstration, arose and said:  \"Gentlemen, I have the honor to present to you a bill to meet the eventual expenditures of a national war.\"  The announcement was greeted by further prolonged applause. The Premier\\'s speech was continually interrupted by enthusiasm, and at times he could hardly continue on account of the wild cheering. The climax was reached when he made a reference to the army and navy. Then the cries seemed interminable, and those on the floor of the House and in the galleries turned to the military tribune from which the officers answered by waving their hands and handkerchiefs.  At the end of the Premier\\'s speech there were deafening vivas for the King, war and Italy. Thirty-four Socialists refused to join the cheers, even in the cry \"Viva Italia!\" and they were hooted and hissed.  The action of the Italian Government created intense feeling. A newspaper man in Vienna, describing the Austrian indignation, said:  \"The exasperation and contempt which Italy\\'s treacherous surprise attack and her hypocritical justification aroused here, are quite indescribable. Neither Serbia nor Russia, despite a long and costly war, is hated. Italy, however, or rather those Italian would-be politicians and business men who offer violence to the majority of peaceful Italian people, are unutterably hated.\" On the other hand German papers spoke with much more moderation and recognized that Italy was acting in an entirely natural manner.  On the very day on which war was declared active operations were begun. Both sides had been making elaborate preparations. Austria had prepared herself by building strong fortifications in which were employed the latest technical improvements in defensive warfare. Upon the Carso and around Gorizia the Austrians had placed innumerable batteries of powerful guns mounted on rails and protected by armor plates. They also had a great number of medium and smaller guns. A net of trenches had been excavated and constructed in cement all along the edge of the hills which dominated the course of the Isonzo River.   [Illustration: Painting: Hundreds of soldiers using ropes to drag a large gun up a mountain slope.]   ITALY\\'S TITANIC LABOR TO CONQUER THE ALPS   When the Italians were making their first mighty advance against   Austria descriptions came through of the almost unbelievable natural   obstacles they were conquering. Getting one of the monster guns into   position in the mountains, as shown above, over the track that had to   be built for every foot of its progress, was one such handicap.   [Illustration: Painting: Soldiers debarking from a transport under heavy gun fire.]   THE HISTORIC LANDING FROM THE \"RIVER CLYDE\" AT SEDDUL BARR   An incident of the Dardanelles Expedition. Horrible losses were   sustained by the Allied troops from the concentrated fire of the   Turkish machine guns on shore.   These trenches, occupying a position nearly impregnable because so mountainous, were defended by every modern device. They were protected with numerous machine guns, surrounded by wire entanglements through which ran a strong electric current. These lines of trenches followed without interruption from the banks of the Isonzo to the summit of the mountains which dominate it; they formed a kind of formidable staircase which had to be conquered step by step with enormous sacrifice.  During this same period General Cadorna, then head of the Italian army, had been bringing that army up to date, working for high efficiency and piling up munitions.  The Army of Italy was a formidable one. Every man in Italy is liable to military service for a period of nineteen years from the age of twenty to thirty-nine.  At the time of the war the approximate war strength of the army was as follows: Officers, 41,692; active army with the colors, 289,910; reserve, 638,979; mobile militia, 299,956; territorial militia, 1,889,659; total strength, 3,159,836. The above number of total men available included upward of 1,200,000 fully trained soldiers, with perhaps another 800,000 partially trained men, the remaining million being completely untrained men. This army was splendidly armed, its officers well educated, and the men brave and disciplined.  The Italian plan of campaign apparently consisted first, in neutralizing the Trentino by capturing or covering the defenses and cutting the two lines of communication with Austria proper, the railway which ran south from Insbruck, and that which ran southwest from Vienna and joined the former at Fransensfets; and second, in a movement in force on the eastern frontier, with Trieste captured or covered on the right flank in the direction of the Austrian fortress at Klagenfurt and Vienna.  The first blow was struck by Austria on the day that war was declared. On that day bombs were dropped on Venice, and five other Adriatic ports were shelled from air, and some from sea. The Italian armies invaded Austria on the east with great rapidity, and by May 27th a part of the Italian forces had moved across the Isonzo River to Monfalcone, sixteen miles northwest of Trieste. Another force penetrated further to the north in the Crown land of Gorizia, and Gradisca. Reports from Italy were that encounters with the enemy had thus far been merely outpost skirmishes, but had allowed Italy to occupy advantageous positions on Austrian territory By June 1st, the Italians had occupied the greater part of the west bank of the Isonzo, with little opposition. The left wing was beyond the Isonzo, at Caporetto, fighting among the boulders of Monte Nero, where the Austrian artillery had strong positions. Monfalcone was kept under constant bombardment.  A general Italian advance took place on June 7th across the Isonzo River from Caporetto to the sea, a distance of about forty miles. Monfalcone was taken by the Italians on June the 10th, the first serious blow against Trieste, as Monfalcone was a railway junction, and its electrical works operated the light and power of Trieste.  Next day the center made a great blow against Gradisca and Sagrado, but the river line proved too strong. The only success was won that night at Plava, north of Borrigia, which was carried by a surprise attack. The Isonzo was in flood, and presented a serious obstacle to the onrush of the Italians. By June 14th the Italian eastern army had pushed forward along the gulf of Trieste toward the town of Nebrosina, nine miles from Trieste.  Meanwhile, the Austrian armies were being constantly strengthened. The initial weakness of the Austrian defensive was due to the fact that the armies normally assigned to the invaded region had been sent to defend the Austrian line in Galicia against the Russians. When Italy began her invasion the defenses of the country were chiefly in the hands of hastily mobilized youths below the military age of nineteen, and men above the military age of forty-two. From now on Austrian troops began to arrive from the Galician front, some of these representing the finest fighting material in the Austrian ranks. The chance of an easy victory was slipping from Italy\\'s hands. The Italian advance was checked.  On the 15th of June the Italians carried an important position on Monte Nero, climbing the rocks by night and attacking by dawn. But this conquest did not help much. No guns of great caliber could be carried on the mountain, and Tolmino, which had been heavily fortified, and contained a garrison of some thirty thousand men, was entirely safe. The following week there were repeated counter-attacks at Plava and on Monte Nero, but the Italians held what they had won.   [Illustration: Map]   AREA OF GENERAL CADORNA\\'S SUCCESSFUL OPERATIONS AGAINST GORIZIA   The Isonzo valley forms the eastern line for the defense of Italy and   its possession was essential to the realization of Italian ideals.   Gorizia, its main strategic position, first fell to the Italians   August 9, 1916.   The position was now that Cadorna\\'s left wing was in a strong position, but could not do much against Tolmino. His center was facing the great camp of Gorizia, while his right was on the edge of the Carso, and had advanced as far as Dueno, on the Monfalcone-Trieste Railroad. The army was in position to make an attack upon Gorizia. On the 2d of July an attack on a broad front was aimed directly at Gorizia. The left was to swing around against the defenses of Gorizia to the north; the center was directed against the Gorizia bridge head, and the right was to swing around to the northeast through the Doberdo plateau. If it succeeded the Trieste railway would be cut and Gorizia must fall.  Long and confused fighting followed. The center and the right of the Italian army slowly advanced their line, taking over one thousand prisoners. For days there was continuous bombardment and counter-bombardment. The fighting on the left was terrific. In the neighborhood of Plava the Italian forces found themselves opposed by Hungarian troops, unaccustomed to mountain warfare, who at first fell back. Austrian reserves came to their aid, and flung back three times the Italian charge.  Three new Italian brigades were brought up, and King Victor Emanuel himself came to encourage his troops. The final assault carried the heights. On the 22d of July the Italian right captured the crest of San Michele, which dominates the Doberdo plateau.  Meanwhile the Austrian armies were being heavily reinforced, and General Cadorna found himself unable to make progress. Much ground had been won but Gorizia was still unredeemed. Many important vantage points were in Italian hands, but it was difficult to advance. The result of the three months\\' campaign was a stalemate. In the high mountains to the north Italy\\'s campaign was a war of defense. To undertake her offensive on the Isonzo it was necessary that she guard her flanks and rear. The Tyrolese battle-ground contained three distinct points where it was necessary to operate; the Trentino Salient, the passes of the Dolomites, and the passes of the Carnic Alps.  Early in June Italy had won control of the ridges of the mountains in the two latter points, but the problem in the Trentino was more difficult. It was necessary, because of the converging valleys, to push her front well inland. On the Carnic Alps the fighting consisted of unimportant skirmishes. The main struggle centered around the pass of Monte Croce Carnico.  In two weeks the Alpini had seized dominating positions to the west of the pass, but the Austrians clung to the farther slopes. A great deal of picturesque fighting went on, but not much progress was made. Further west in the Dolomite region there was more fighting. On the 30th of May Cartina had been captured, and the Italians moved north toward the Pusterthal Railway. Progress was slow, as the main routes to the railway were difficult.  By the middle of August they were only a few miles from the railway, but all the routes led through defiles, and the neighboring heights were in the possession of the Austrians. To capture these heights was a most difficult feat, which the Italians performed in the most brilliant way; but even after they had passed these defiles success was not yet won. Each Italian column was in its own grove, with no lateral communication. The Austrians could mass themselves where they pleased. As a result the Italian forces were compelled to halt.  In the Trentino campaign the Italians soon captured the passes, and moved against Trente and Roverito. These towns were heavily fortified, as were their surrounding heights. The campaign became a series of small fights on mountain peaks and mountain ridges. Only small bodies of troops could maneuver, and the raising of guns up steep precipices was extremely difficult. The Italians slowly succeeded in gaining ground, and established a chain of posts around the heights so that often one would see guns and barbed wire intrenchments at a height of more than ten thousand feet among the crevasses of the glaciers. The Alpini performed wonderful feats of physical endurance, but the plains of Lombardy were still safe.    CHAPTER XX  GLORIOUS GALLIPOLI  If ever the true mettle and temper of a people were tried and exemplified in the crucible of battle, that battle was the naval and land engagement embracing Gallipoli and the Dardanelles and the people so tested, the British race. Separated in point of time but united in its general plan, the engagements present a picture of heroism founded upon strategic mistakes; of such perseverance and dogged determination against overwhelming natural and artificial odds as even the pages of supreme British bravery cannot parallel. The immortal charge of the Light Brigade was of a piece with Gallipoli, but it was merely a battle fragment and its glorious record was written in blood within the scope of a comparatively few inspired minutes. In the mine-strewn Dardanelles and upon the sun-baked, blood-drenched rocky slopes of Gallipoli, death always partnered every sailor and soldier. As at Balaklava, virtually everyone knew that some one had blundered, but the army and the navy as one man fought to the bitter end to make the best of a bad bargain, to tear triumph out of impossibilities.  France co-operated with the British in the naval engagement, but the greater sacrifice, the supreme charnel house of the war, the British race reserved for itself. There, the yeomanry of England, the unsung county regiments whose sacrifices and achievements have been neglected in England\\'s generous desire to honor the men from \"down under,\" the Australians and New Zealanders grouped under the imperishable title of the Anzacs--there the Scotch, Welsh and Irish knit in one devoted British Army with the great fighters from the self-governing colonies waged a battle so hopeless and so gallant that the word Gallipoli shall always remind the world how man may triumph over the fear of death; how with nothing but defeat and disaster before them, men may go to their deaths as unconcernedly as in other days they go to their nightly sleep.  On November 5, 1914, Great Britain declared war upon Turkey. Hostilities, however, had preceded the declaration. On November 3d the combined French and British squadrons had bombarded the entrance forts. This was merely intended to draw the fire of the forts and make an estimate of their power. From that time on a blockade was maintained, and on the 13th of December a submarine, commanded by Lieutenant Holbrook, entered the straits and torpedoed the Turkish warship Messoudieh, which was guarding the mine fields.  By the end of January the blockading fleet, through constant reinforcement, had become very strong, and had seized the Island of Tenedos and taken possession of Lemnos, which nominally belonged to Greece, as bases for naval operations. On the 19th of February began the great attack upon the forts at the entrance to the Dardanelles, which attracted the attention of the world for nearly a year.  The expedition against the Dardanelles had been considered with the greatest care, and approved by the naval authorities. That their judgment was correct, however, is another question. The history of naval warfare seems to make very plain that a ship, however powerful, is at a tremendous disadvantage when attacking forts on land. The badly served cannon of Alexandria fell, indeed, before a British fleet, but Gallipoli had been fortified by German engineers, and its guns were the Krupp cannon. The British fleet found itself opposed by unsurmountable obstacles. Looking backward it seems possible, that if at the very start Lord Kitchener had permitted a detachment of troops to accompany the fleet, success might have been attained, but without the army the navy was powerless.  The Peninsula of Gallipoli is a tongue of land about fifty miles long, varying in width from twelve to two or three miles. It is a mass of rocky hills so steep that in many places it is a matter of difficulty to reach their tops. On it are a few villages, but there are no decent roads and little cultivated land. On the southern shore of the Dardanelles conditions are nearly the same. Here, the entrance is a flat and marshy plain, but east of this plain are hills three thousand feet high. The high ground overhangs the sea passage on both sides, and with the exception of narrow bits of beach at their base, presents almost no opportunity for landing.   [Illustration:  Map: Gallipoli and surroundings]   MAP OF THE GALLIPOLI PENINSULA Showing the various landing places,   with inset of the Sari-Bair Region.   A strong current continually sifts down the straits from the Sea of Marmora.  Forts were placed at the entrance on both the north and south side, but they were not heavily armed and were merely outposts. Fourteen miles from the mouth the straits become quite narrow, making a sharp turn directly north and then resuming their original direction. The channel thus makes a sharp double bend. At the entrance to the strait, known as the Narrows, were powerful fortresses, and the slopes were studded with batteries. Along both sides of the channel the low ground was lined with batteries. It was possible to attack the forts at fairly long range, but there was no room to bring any large number of ships into action at the same time.  At the time of the Gallipoli adventure there were probably nearly half a million of men available for a defense of the straits, men well armed and well trained under German leadership. The first step was comparatively easy. The operations against the other forts began at 8 A.M. on Friday, the 19th of February. The ships engaged were the Inflexible, the Agamemnon, the Cornwallis, the Vengeance and the Triumph from the British fleet, and the Bouvet, Suffren, and the Gaulois from the French, all under the command of Vice-Admiral Sackville Carden. The French squadron was under Rear-Admiral Gueprette. A flotilla of destroyers accompanied the fleet, and airplanes were sent up to guide the fire of the battleships.  At first the fleet was arranged in a semicircle some miles out to sea from the entrance to the strait. It afforded an inspiring spectacle as the ships came along and took up position, and the picture became most awe-inspiring when the guns began to boom. The bombardment at first was slow. Shells from the various ships screaming through the air at the rate of about one every two minutes.  The Turkish batteries, however, were not to be drawn, and, seeing this, the British Admiral sent one British ship and one French ship close in shore toward the Sedd-el-Bahr forts. As they went in they sped right under the guns of the shore batteries, which could no longer resist the temptation to see what they could do. Puffs of white smoke dotted the landscape on the far shore, and dull booms echoed over the placid water. Around the ships fountains of water sprang up into the air. The enemy had been drawn, but his marksmanship was obviously very bad. Not a single shot directed against the ships went within a hundred yards of either.  At sundown on account of the failing light Admiral Carden withdrew the fleet. On account of the bad weather the attack was not renewed until February 25th. It appeared that the outer forts had not been seriously damaged on the 19th, and that what injury had been done had been repaired. In an hour and a half the Cape Helles fort was silenced. The Agamemnon was hit by a shell fired at a range of six miles, which killed three men and wounded five. Early in the afternoon Sedd-el-Bahr was attacked at close range, but not silenced till after 5 P.M. At this time British trawlers began sweeping the entrance for mines, and during the next day the mine field was cleared for a distance of four miles up the straits.  As soon as this clearance was made the Albion, Vengeance and Majestic steamed into the strait and attacked Fort Dardanos, a fortification some distance below the Narrows. The Turks replied vigorously, not only from Dardanos but from batteries scattered along the shore. Believing that the Turks had abandoned the forts at the entrance, landing parties of marines were sent to shore. In a short time, however, they met a detachment of the enemy and were compelled to retreat to their boats. The outer forts, however, were destroyed, and their destruction was extremely encouraging to the Allies.  For a time a series of minor operations was carried on, meeting with much success. Besides attacks on forts inside of the strait, Smyrna was bombarded on March the 5th, and on March the 6th the Queen Elizabeth, the Agamemnon and the Ocean bombarded the forts at Chanak on the Asiatic side of the Narrows, from a position in the gulf of Saros on the outer side of the Gallipoli Peninsula. To all of these attacks the Turks replied vigorously and the attacking ships were repeatedly struck, but with no loss of life. On the 7th of March Fort Dardanos was silenced, and Fort Chanak ceased firing, but, as it turned out, only temporarily.  Preparations were now being made for a serious effort against the Narrows. The date of the attack was fixed for March 17th, weather permitting. On the 16th Admiral Carden was stricken down with illness and was invalided by medical authority. Admiral de Roebeck, second in command, who had been very active in the operations, was appointed to succeed him. Admiral de Roebeck was in cordial sympathy with the purposes of the expedition and determined to attack on the 18th of March. At a quarter to eleven that morning, the Queen Elizabeth, Inflexible, Agamemnon, Lord Nelson, the Triumph and Prince George steamed up the straits towards the Narrows, and bombarded the forts of Chanak. At 12.22 the French squadron, consisting of the Suffren, Gaulois, Charlemagne, and Bouvet, advanced up the Dardanelles to aid their English associates.  Under the combined fire of the two squadrons the Turkish forts, which at first replied strongly, were finally silenced. All of the ships, however, were hit several times during this part of the action. A third squadron, including the Vengeance, Irresistible, Albion, Ocean, Swiftshore and Majestic, then advanced to relieve the six old battleships inside the strait.  As the French squadron, which had engaged the forts in a most brilliant fashion, was passing out the Bouvet was blown up by a drifting mine and sank in less than three minutes, carrying with her most of her crew. At 2.36 P.M. the relief battleships renewed the attack on the forts, which again opened fire. The Turks were now sending mines down with the current. At 4.09 the Irresistible quitted the line, listing heavily, and at 5.50 she sank, having probably struck a drifting mine. At 6.05 the Ocean, also having struck a mine, sank in deep water. Practically the whole of the crews were removed safely. The Gaulois was damaged by gunfire; the Inflexible had her forward control position hit by a heavy shell, which killed and wounded the majority of the men and officers at that station and set her on fire. At sunset the forts were still in action, and during the twilight the Allied fleet slipped out of the Dardanelles.  Meantime, an expeditionary force was being gathered. The largest portion of this force came from Great Britain, but France also provided a considerable number from her marines and from her Colonial army. Both nations avoided, as far as possible, drawing upon the armies destined for service in France.  In the English army there were divisions from Australia and New Zealand and there were a number of Indian troops and Territorials. The whole force was put under the command of General Sir Ian Hamilton. The commander-in-chief on the Turkish side was the German General Liman von Sanders, the former chief of the military mission at Constantinople. The bulk of the expeditionary force, which numbered altogether about a hundred and twenty thousand men, were, therefore, men whose presence in the east did not weaken the Allied strength in the west.  The great difficulty of the new plan was that it was impossible to surprise the enemy. The whole Gallipoli Peninsula was so small that a landing at any point would be promptly observed, and the nature of the ground was of such a character that progress from any point must necessarily be slow. The problem was therefore a simple one.  The expeditionary force gathered in Egypt during the first half of April, and about the middle of the month was being sent to Lemnos. Germany was well aware of the English plans, and was doing all that it could to provide a defense.  On April 23d the movement began, and about five o\\'clock in the afternoon the first of the transports slowly made its way through the maze of shipping toward the entrance of Mudros Bay.  Immediately the patent apathy, which had gradually overwhelmed everyone, changed to the utmost enthusiasm, and as the liners steamed through the fleet, their decks yellow with khaki, the crews of the warships cheered them on to victory while the bands played them out with an unending variety of popular airs. The soldiers in the transports answered this last salutation from the navy with deafening cheers, and no more inspiring spectacle has ever been seen than this great expedition.  The whole of the fleet from the transports had been divided up into five divisions and there were three main landings. The 29th Division disembarked off the point of the Gallipoli Peninsula near Sedd-el-Bahr, where its operations were covered both from the gulf of Saros and from the Dardanelles by the fire of the covering warships. The Australian and New Zealand contingent disembarked north of Gaba Tepe. Further north a naval division made a demonstration.  Awaiting the Australians was a party of Turks who had been intrenched almost on the shore and had opened up a terrific fusillade. The Australian volunteers rose, as a man, to the occasion. They waited neither for orders nor for the boats to reach the beach, but springing out into the sea they went in to the shore, and forming some sort of a rough line rushed straight on the flashes of the enemy\\'s rifles. In less than a quarter of an hour the Turks were in full flight.  While the Australians and New Zealanders, or Anzacs as they are now generally known from the initials of the words Australian-New Zealand Army Corps, were fighting so gallantly at Gaba Tepe, the British troops were landing at the southern end of the Gallipoli Peninsula. The advance was slow and difficult. The Turk was pushed back, little by little, and the ground gained organized. The details of this progress, though full of incidents of the greatest courage and daring, need not be recounted.  On June the 4th a general attack was made, preceded by heavy bombardments by all guns, but after terrific fighting, in which many prisoners were captured and great losses suffered, the net result was an advance of about five hundred yards. As time went on the general impression throughout the Allied countries was that the expedition had failed. On June 30th the losses of the Turks were estimated at not less than seventy thousand, and the British naval and military losses up to June 1st, aggregated 38,635 officers and men. At that time the British and French allies held but a small corner of the area to be conquered. In all of these attacks the part played by the Australian and New Zealand army corps was especially notable. Reinforcements were repeatedly sent to the Allies, who worked more and more feverishly as time went on with the hope of aiding Russia, which was then desperately struggling against the great German advance.  On August 17th it was reported that a landing had been made at Suvla Bay, the extreme western point of the Peninsula. From this point it was hoped to threaten the Turkish communications with their troops at the lower end of the Peninsula. This new enterprise, however, failed to make any impression, and in the first part of September, vigorous Turkish counter-offensives gained territory from the Franco-British troops. According to the English reports the Turks paid a terrible price for their success.  It had now become evident that the expedition was a failure. The Germans were already gloating over what they called the \"failure of British sea power,\" and English publicists were attempting to show that, though the enterprise had failed, the very presence of a strong Allied force at Saloniki had been an enormous gain. The first official announcement of failure was made December 20, 1916, when it was announced that the British forces at Anzac and Suvla Bay had been withdrawn, and that only the minor positions near Sedd-el-Bahr were occupied. Great Britain\\'s loss of officers and men at the Dardanelles up to December 11th was 112,921, according to an announcement made in the House of Commons by the Parliamentary Under Secretary for War. Besides these casualties the number of sick admitted to hospitals was 96,683. The decision to evacuate Gallipoli was made in the course of November by the British Government as the result of the early expressed opinion of General Monro, who had succeeded General Hamilton on October 28, 1915.  General Monro found himself confronted with a serious problem in the attempt to withdraw an army of such a size from positions not more than three hundred yards from the enemy\\'s trenches, and to embark on open beaches every part of which was within effective range of Turkish guns. Moreover, the evacuation must be done gradually, as it was impossible to move the whole army at once with such means of transportation as existed. The plan was to remove the munitions, supplies and heavy guns by instalments, working only at night, carrying off at the same time a large portion of the troops, but leaving certain picked battalions to guard the trenches. Every endeavor had to be made for concealment. The plan was splendidly successful, and the Turks apparently completely deceived. On December 20th the embarkation of the last troops at Suvla was accomplished. The operations at Anzac were conducted in the same way. Only picked battalions were left to the end, and these were carried safely off.  The success of the Suvla and Anzac evacuation made the position at Cape Helles more dangerous. The Turks were on the lookout, and it seemed almost impossible that they could be again deceived. On January 7th an attack was made by the Turks upon the trenches, which was beaten back. That night more than half the troops had left the Peninsula. The next day there was a heavy storm which made embarkation difficult, but it was nevertheless accomplished. The whole evacuation was a clever and successful bit of work.    CHAPTER XXI  THE GREATEST NAVAL BATTLE IN HISTORY  Germany\\'s ambition for conquest at sea had been nursed and carefully fostered for twenty years. During the decade immediately preceding the declaration of war, it had embarked upon a policy of naval upbuilding that brought it into direct conflict with England\\'s sea policy. Thereafter it became a race in naval construction, England piling up a huge debt in its determination to construct two tons of naval shipping to every one ton built by Germany.  Notwithstanding Great Britain\\'s efforts in this direction, Germany\\'s naval experts, with the ruthless von Tirpitz at their head, maintained that, given a fair seaway with ideal weather conditions favoring the low visibility tactics of the German sea command, a victory for the Teutonic ships would follow. It was this belief that drew the ships of the German cruiser squadron and High Seas Fleet off the coast of Jutland and Horn Reef into the great battle that decided the supremacy of the sea.  The 31st of May, 1916, will go down in history as the date of this titanic conflict. The British light cruiser Galatea on patrol duty near Horn Reef reported at 2.20 o\\'clock on the afternoon of that day, that it had sighted smoke plumes denoting the advance of enemy vessels from the direction of Helgoland Bight. Fifteen minutes later the smoke plumes were in such number and volume that the advance of a considerable force to the northward and eastward was indicated. It was reasoned by Vice-Admiral Beatty, to whom the Galatea had sent the news by radio, that the enemy in rounding Horn Reef would inevitably be brought into action. The first ships of the enemy were sighted at 3.31 o\\'clock. These were the battle screen of fast light cruisers. Back of these were five modern battle cruisers of the highest power and armament.  The report of the battle, by an eye-witness, that was issued upon semiofficial authority of the British Government, follows:  First Phase, 3.30 P.M. May 31st. Beatty\\'s battle cruisers, consisting of the Lion, Princess Royal, Queen Mary, Tiger, Inflexible, Indomitable, Invincible, Indefatigable, and New Zealand, were on a southeasterly course, followed at about two miles distance by the four battleships of the class known as Queen Elizabeths.  Enemy light cruisers were sighted and shortly afterward the head of the German battle cruiser squadron, consisting of the new cruiser Hindenburg, the Seydlitz, Derfflinger, Lutzow, Moltke, and possibly the Salamis.  Beatty at once began firing at a range of about 20,000 yards (twelve miles) which shortened to 16,000 yards (nine miles) as the fleets closed. The Germans could see the British distinctly outlined against the light yellow sky. The Germans, covered by a haze, could be very indistinctly made out by the British gunners.  The Queen Elizabeths opened fire on one after another as they came within range. The German battle cruisers turned to port and drew away to about 20,000 yards.  Second Phase, 4.40 P.M. A destroyer screen then appeared beyond the German battle cruisers. The whole German High Seas Fleet could be seen approaching on the northeastern horizon in three divisions, coming to the support of their battle cruisers.  The German battle cruisers now turned right around 16 points and took station in front of the battleships of the High Fleet.  Beatty, with his battle cruisers and supporting battleships, therefore, had before him the whole of the German battle fleet, and Jellicoe was still some distance away.  The opposing fleets were now moving parallel to one another in opposite directions, and but for a master maneuver on the part of Beatty the British advance ships would have been cut off from Jellicoe\\'s Grand Fleet. In order to avoid this and at the same time prepare the way so that Jellicoe might envelop his adversary, Beatty immediately also turned right around 16 points, so as to bring his ships parallel to the German battle cruisers and facing the same direction.  As soon as he was around he increased to full speed to get ahead of the Germans and take up a tactical position in advance of their line. He was able to do this owing to the superior speed of the British battle cruisers.   [Illustration: Photographs]   Copyright Harris & Ewing.   ADMIRAL WILLIAM S.

FRENCH; Commander-in-chief of the British   force in France and Belgium from the beginning of the war to December,   1915.   Just before the turning point was reached, the Indefatigable sank, and the Queen Mary and the Invincible also were lost at the turning point, where, of course, the High Seas Fleet concentrated their fire.  A little earlier, as the German battle cruisers were turning the Queen Elizabeths had in similar manner concentrated their fire on the turning point and destroyed a new German battle cruiser, believed to be the Hindenburg.  Beatty had now got around and headed away with the loss of three ships, racing parallel to the German battle cruisers. The Queen Elizabeths followed behind engaging the main High Seas Fleet.  Third Phase, 5 P.M. The Queen Elizabeths now turned short to port 16 points in order to follow Beatty. The Warspite jammed her steering gear, failed to get around, and drew the fire of six of the enemy, who closed in upon her.  The Germans claimed her as a loss, since on paper she ought to have been lost, but, as a matter of act, though repeatedly straddled by shell fire with the water boiling up all around her, she was not seriously hit, and was able to sink one of her opponents. Her captain recovered control of the vessel, brought her around, and followed her consorts.  In the meantime the Barham, Valiant and Malaya turned short so as to avoid the danger spot where the Queen Mary and the Invincible had been lost, and for an hour, until Jellicoe arrived, fought a delaying action against the High Seas Fleet.  The Warspite joined them at about 5.15 o\\'clock, and all four ships were so successfully maneuvered in order to upset the spotting corrections of their opponents that no hits of a seriously disabling character were suffered. They had the speed over their opponents by fully four knots, and were able to draw away from part of the long line of German battleships, which almost filled up the horizon.  At this time the Queen Elizabeths were steadily firing on at the flashes of German guns at a range which varied between 12,000 and 15,000 yards, especially against those ships which were nearest them. The Germans were enveloped in a mist and only smoke and flashes were visible.  By 5.45 half of the High Seas Fleet had been left out of range, and the Queen Elizabeths were steaming fast to join hands with Jellicoe.  To return to Beatty\\'s battle cruisers. They had succeeded in outflanking the German battle cruisers, which were, therefore, obliged to turn a full right angle to starboard to avoid being headed.  Heavy fighting was renewed between the opposing battle cruiser squadrons, during which the Derfflinger was sunk; but toward 6 o\\'clock the German fire slackened very considerably, showing that Beatty\\'s battle cruisers and the Queen Elizabeths had inflicted serious damage on their immediate opponents.  Fourth Phase, 6 P.M. The Grand Fleet was now in sight, and, coming up fast in three directions, the Queen Elizabeths altered their course four points to the starboard and drew in toward the enemy to allow Jellicoe room to deploy into line.  The Grand Fleet was perfectly maneuvered and the very difficult operation of deploying between the battle cruisers and the Queen Elizabeths was perfectly timed.  Jellicoe came up, fell in behind Beatty\\'s cruisers, and followed by the damaged but still serviceable Queen Elizabeths, steamed right across the head of the German fleet.  The first of the ships to come into action were the Revenue and the Royal Oak with their fifteen-inch guns, and the Agincourt which fired from her seven turrets with the speed almost of a Maxim gun.  The whole British fleet had now become concentrated. They had been perfectly maneuvered, so as to \"cross the T\" of the High Seas Fleet, and, indeed, only decent light was necessary to complete their work of destroying the Germans in detail. The light did improve for a few minutes, and the conditions were favorable to the British fleet, which was now in line approximately north and south across the head of the Germans.  During the few minutes of good light Jellicoe smashed up the first three German ships, but the mist came down, visibility suddenly failed, and the defeated High Seas Fleet was able to draw off in ragged divisions.  Fifth Phase, Night. The Germans were followed by the British, who still had them enveloped between Jellicoe on the west, Beatty on the north, and Evan Thomas with his three Queen Elizabeths on the south. The Warspite had been sent back to her base.   [Illustration: Map]   HOW THE GREAT NAVAL BATTLE OF JUTLAND WAS FOUGHT   This chart must be taken only as a general indication of the courses   of the opposing fleets. Sir David Beatty with two squadrons of battle   cruisers and one squadron of fast battleships, first steamed southward   and southeastward of the German battle cruiser squadron; then,   sighting the German battle fleet, turned northward, afterwards bearing   eastward and connecting with Sir John Jellicoe\\'s battle squadron.   During the night the torpedo boat destroyers heavily attacked the German ships, and, although they lost seriously themselves, succeeded in sinking two of the enemy.  Coordination of the units of the fleet was practically impossible to keep up, and the Germans discovered by the rays of their searchlights the three Queen Elizabeths, not more than 4,000 yards away. Unfortunately they were then able to escape between the battleships and Jellicoe, since the British gunners were not able to fire, as the destroyers were in the way.  So ended the Jutland battle, which was fought as had been planned and very nearly a great success. It was spoiled by the unfavorable weather conditions, especially at the critical moment, when the whole British fleet was concentrated and engaged in crushing the head of the German line.  Commenting on the engagement, Admiral Jellicoe said: \"The battle cruiser fleet, gallantly led by Vice-Admiral Beatty, and admirably supported by the ships of the fifth battle squadron under Rear Admiral Evan-Thomas, fought the action under, at times, disadvantageous conditions, especially in regard to light, in a manner that was in keeping with the best traditions of the service.\"  His estimate of the German losses was: two battleships of the dreadnought type, one of the Deutschland type, which was seen to sink; the battle cruiser Lutzow, admitted by the Germans; one battle cruiser of the dreadnought type, one battle cruiser seen to be so severely damaged that its return was extremely doubtful; five light cruisers, seen to sink--one of them possibly a battleship; six destroyers seen to sink, three destroyers so damaged that it was doubtful if they would be able to reach port, and a submarine sunk. The official German report admitted only eleven ships sunk; the first British report placed the total at eighteen, but Admiral Jellicoe enumerated twenty-one German vessels as probably lost.  The Admiral paid a fine tribute to the German naval men: \"The enemy,\" he said, \"fought with the gallantry that was expected of him. We particularly admired the conduct of those on board a disabled German light cruiser which passed down the British line shortly after the deployment under a heavy fire, which was returned by the only gun left in action. The conduct of the officers and men war entirely beyond praise. On all sides it is reported that the glorious traditions of the past were most worthily upheld; whether in the heavy ships, cruisers, light cruisers, or destroyers, the same admirable spirit prevailed. The officers and men were cool and determined, with a cheeriness that would have carried them through anything. The heroism of the wounded was the \\'admiration\\' of all. I cannot adequately express the pride with which the spirit of the fleet filled me.\"  At daylight on the 1st of June the British battle fleet, being southward of Horn Reef, turned northward in search of the enemy vessels. The visibility early on the first of June was three to four miles less than on May 31st, and the torpedo-boat destroyers, being out of visual touch, did not rejoin the fleet until 9 A.M. The British fleet remained in the proximity of the battlefield and near the line of approach to the German ports until 11 A.M., in spite of the disadvantage of long distances from fleet bases and the danger incurred in waters adjacent to the enemy\\'s coasts from submarines and torpedo craft.  The enemy, however, made no sign, and the admiral was reluctantly compelled to the conclusion that the High Sea Fleet had returned into port. Subsequent events proved this assumption to have been correct. The British position must have been known to the enemy, as at 4 A.M. the fleet engaged a Zeppelin about five minutes, during which time she had ample opportunity to note and subsequently report the position and course of the British fleet.  The Germans at first claimed a victory for their fleet. The test, of course, was the outcome of the battle. The fact that the German fleet retreated and nevermore ventured forth from beneath the protecting guns and mine fields around Helgoland, demonstrates beyond dispute that the British were entitled to the triumph. The German official report makes the best presentation of the German case. It follows in full:   The High Sea Fleet, consisting of three battleship squadrons, five battle cruisers, and a large number of small cruisers, with several destroyer flotillas, was cruising in the Skagerrak on May 31 for the purpose, as on earlier occasions, of offering battle to the      British fleet. The vanguard of the small cruisers at 4.30 o\\'clock in the afternoon (German time) suddenly encountered ninety miles west of Hanstholm, (a cape on the northwest coast of Jutland), a group of eight of the newest cruisers of the Calliope class and fifteen or twenty of the most modern destroyers.  While the German light forces and the first cruiser squadron under Vice Admiral Hipper were following the British, who were retiring north-westward, the German battle cruisers sighted to the westward Vice Admiral Beatty\\'s battle squadron of six ships, including four of the Lion type and two of the Indefatigable type. Beatty\\'s squadron developed a battle line on a southeasterly course and Vice Admiral Hipper formed his line ahead on the same general course and approached for a running fight. He opened fire at 5.49 o\\'clock in the afternoon with heavy artillery at a range of 13,000 meters against the superior enemy. The weather was clear and light, and the sea was light with a northwest wind.  After about a quarter of an hour a violent explosion occurred on the last cruiser of the Indefatigable type. It was caused by a heavy shell, and destroyed the vessel.  About 6.20 o\\'clock in the afternoon five warships of the Queen Elizabeth type came from the west and joined the British battle cruiser line, powerfully reinforcing with their fifteen-inch guns the five British battle cruisers remaining after 6.20 o\\'clock. To      equalize this superiority Vice Admiral Hipper ordered the destroyers to attack the enemy. The British destroyers and small cruisers interposed, and a bitter engagement at close range ensued, in the course of which a light cruiser participated.  The Germans lost two torpedo boats, the crews of which were rescued by sister ships under a heavy fire. Two British destroyers were sunk by artillery, and two others--the Nestor and Nomad--remained on the scene in a crippled condition. These later were destroyed by the main fleet after German torpedo boats had rescued all the survivors.  While this engagement was in progress, a mighty explosion, caused by a big shell, broke the Queen Mary, the third ship in line, asunder, at 6.30 o\\'clock.  Soon thereafter the German main battleship fleet was sighted to the southward, steering north. The hostile fast squadrons thereupon turned northward, closing the first part of the fight, which lasted about an hour.  The British retired at high speed before the German fleet, which followed closely. The German battle cruisers continued the artillery combat with increasing intensity, particularly with the division of the vessels of the Queen Elizabeth type, and in this the leading German battleship division participated intermittently. The hostile ships showed a desire to run in a flat curve ahead of the point of our line and to cross it.  At 7.45 o\\'clock in the evening British small cruisers and destroyers launched an attack against our battle cruisers, who avoided the torpedoes by maneuvering, while the British battle cruisers retired from the engagement, in which they did not participate further as far as can be established. Shortly thereafter a German reconnoitering group, which was parrying the destroyer attack, received an attack from the northeast. The cruiser Wiesbaden was soon put out of action in this attack. The German torpedo flotillas immediately attacked the heavy ships.  Appearing shadow-like from the haze bank to the northeast was made out a long line of at least twenty-five battleships, which at first sought a junction with the British battle cruisers and those of the Queen Elizabeth type on a northwesterly to westerly course, and then turned on an easterly to southeasterly course.  With the advent of the British main fleet, whose center consisted of three squadrons of eight battleships each, with a fast division of three battle cruisers of the Invincible type on the northern-end, and three of the newest vessels of the Royal Sovereign class, armed with fifteen-inch guns, at the southern end, there began about 8 o\\'clock in the evening the third section of the engagement, embracing the combat between the main fleets.  Vice Admiral Scheer determined to attack the British main fleet, which he now recognized was completely assembled and about doubly superior. The German battleship squadron, headed by battle cruisers, steered first toward the extensive haze bank to the      northeast, where the crippled cruiser Wiesbaden was still receiving a heavy fire. Around the Wiesbaden stubborn individual fights under quickly changing conditions now occurred.  The light enemy forces, supported by an armored cruiser squadron of five ships of the Minatour, Achilles, and Duke of Edinburgh classes coming from the northeast, were encountered and apparently surprised on account of the decreasing visibility of our battle      cruisers and leading battleship division. The squadron came under a violent and heavy fire by which the small cruisers Defense and Black Prince were sunk. The cruiser Warrior regained its own line a wreck and later sank. Another small cruiser was damaged severely.   Two destroyers already had fallen victims to the attack of German  torpedo boats against the leading British battleships and a small  cruiser and two destroyers were damaged. The German battle cruisers and  leading battleship division had in these engagements come under  increased fire of the enemy\\'s battleship squadron, which, shortly after  8 o\\'clock, could be made out in the haze turning to the north-eastward  and finally to the east, Germans observed, amid the artillery combat  and shelling of great intensity, signs of the effect of good shooting  between 8.20 and 8.30 o\\'clock particularly.      Several officers on  German ships observed that a battleship of the Queen Elizabeth class  blew up under conditions similar to that of the Queen Mary. The  Invincible sank after being hit severely. A ship of the Iron Duke class  had earlier received a torpedo hit, and      one of the Queen Elizabeth  class was running around in a circle,  its steering apparatus  apparently having been hit.  The Lutzow was hit by at least fifteen heavy shells and was unable to maintain its place in line. Vice Admiral Hipper, therefore, trans-shipped to the Moltke on a torpedo boat and under a heavy fire. The Derfflinger meantime took the lead temporarily. Parts of the German torpedo flotilla attacked the enemy\\'s main fleet and heard detonations. In the action the Germans lost a torpedo boat. An enemy destroyer was seen in a sinking condition, having been hit by a torpedo.  After the first violent onslaught into the mass of the superior enemy the opponents lost sight of each other in the smoke by powder clouds. After a short cessation in the artillery combat Vice Admiral Scheer ordered a new attack by all the available forces.  German battle cruisers, which with several light cruisers and torpedo boats again headed the line, encountered the enemy soon after 9 o\\'clock and renewed the heavy fire, which was answered by them from the mist, and then by the leading division of the main      fleet. Armored cruisers now flung themselves in a reckless onset at extreme speed against the enemy line in order to cover the attack of the torpedo boats. They approached the enemy line, although covered with shot from 6,000 meters distances. Several German torpedo flotillas dashed forward to attack, delivered torpedoes, and returned, despite the most severe counterfire, with the loss of only one boat. The bitter artillery fire was again interrupted, after this second violent onslaught, by the smoke from guns and funnels.  Several torpedo flotillas, which were ordered to attack somewhat later, found, after penetrating the smoke cloud, that the enemy fleet was no longer before them; nor, when the fleet commander again brought the German squadrons upon the southerly and southwesterly course where the enemy was last seen, could our opponents be found. Only once more--shortly before 10.30 o\\'clock--did the battle flare up. For a short time in the late twilight German battle cruisers sighted four enemy capital ships to seaward and opened fire immediately. As the two German battleship squadrons attacked, the enemy turned and vanished in the darkness. Older German light cruisers of the fourth reconnoissance group also were engaged with the older enemy armored cruisers in a short fight. This ended the day battle.  The German divisions, which, after losing sight of the enemy, began a night cruise in a southerly direction, were attacked until dawn by enemy light force in rapid succession.  The attacks were favored by the general strategic situation and the particularly dark night.  The cruiser Frauenlob was injured severely during the engagement of the fourth reconnoissance group with a superior cruiser force, and was lost from sight.  One armored cruiser of the Cressy class suddenly appeared close to a German battleship and was shot into fire after forty seconds, and sank in four minutes.  The Florent (?) Destroyer 60, (the names were hard to decipher in the darkness and therefore were uncertainly established) and four destroyers--3, 78, 06, and 27--were destroyed by our fire. One destroyer was cut in two by the ram of a German battleship. Seven destroyers, including the G-30, were hit and severely damaged. These, including the Tipperary and Turbulent, which after saving survivors, were left behind in a sinking condition, drifted past our line, some of them burning at the bow or stern.  The tracks of countless torpedoes were sighted by the German ships, but only the Pommern (a battleship) fell an immediate victim to a torpedo. The cruiser Rostock was hit, but remained afloat. The cruiser Elbing was damaged by a German battleship during an unavoidable maneuver. After vain endeavors to keep the ship afloat the Elbing was blown up, but only after her crew had embarked on torpedo boats. A post torpedo boat was struck by a mine laid by the enemy.

The entire crew was also lost, except twelve men, a warrant officer and eleven seamen, who escaped on a raft. Earl Kitchener was on his way to Russia, at the request of the Russian Government, for a consultation regarding munitions to be furnished the Russian army. He was intending to go to Archangel and visit Petrograd, and expected to be back in London by June 20th. He was accompanied by Hugh James O\\'Beirne, former Councillor of the British Embassy at Petrograd, O.A. Fitz-Gerald, his military secretary, Brigadier-General Ellarshaw, and Sir Frederick Donaldson, all of whom were lost.  The cause of the sinking of the Hampshire is not known. It is supposed that it struck a mine, but the tragedy very naturally brought into existence many stories which ascribe his death to more direct German action.  Seaman Rogerson, one of the survivors, describes Lord Kitchener\\'s last moments as follows: \"Of those who left the ship, and have survived, I was the one who saw Lord Kitchener last. He went down with the ship, he did not leave her. I saw Captain Seville help his boat\\'s crew to clear away his galley. At the same time the Captain was calling to Lord Kitchener to come to the boat, but owing to the noise made by the wind and sea, Lord Kitchener could not hear him, I think. When the explosion occurred, Kitchener walked calmly from the Captain\\'s cabin, went up the ladder and on to the quarter deck. There I saw him walking quite collectedly, talking to two of the officers. All three were wearing khaki and had no overcoats on. Kitchener calmly watched the preparations for abandoning the ship, which were going on in a steady and orderly way. The crew just went to their stations, obeyed orders, and did their best to get out the boats. But it was impossible. Owing to the rough weather, no boats could be lowered. Those that were got out were smashed up at once. No boats left the ship. What people on the shore thought to be boats leaving, were rafts. Men did get into the boats as these lay in their cradles, thinking that as the ship went under the boats would float, but the ship sank by the head, and when she went she turned a somersault forward, carrying down with her all the boats and those in them. I do not think Kitchener got into a boat. When I sprang to a raft he was still on the starboard side of the quarter deck, talking with the officers. From the little time that elapsed between my leaving the ship and her sinking I feel certain Kitchener went down with her, and was on deck at the time she sank.\"   [Illustration: Map]   WHERE EARL KITCHENER MET HIS DEATH   The British Admiralty, after investigation, gave out a statement declaring that the vessel struck a mine, and sank about fifteen minutes after.  The news of Lord Kitchener\\'s death shocked the whole Allied world. He was the most important personality in the British Empire. He had built up the British army, and his name was one to conjure by. His efficiency was a proverb, and he had an air of mystery about him that made him a sort of a popular hero. He was great before the World War began; he was the conqueror of the Soudan; the winner of the South African campaign; the reorganizer of Egypt. In his work as Secretary of War he had met with some criticism, but he possessed, more than any other man, the public confidence. At the beginning of the war he was appointed Secretary of War at the demand of an overwhelming public opinion. He realized more than any one else what such a war would mean. When others thought of it as an adventure to be soon concluded, he recognized that there would be years of bitter conflict. He asked England to give up its cherished tradition of a volunteer army; to go through arduous military training; he saw the danger to the Empire, and he alone, perhaps, had the authority to inspire his countrymen with the will to sacrifice. But his work was done. The great British army was in the field.    CHAPTER XXII  THE RUSSIAN CAMPAIGN  In the very beginning Russia had marked out one point for attack. This was the city of Cracow. No doubt the Grand Duke Nicholas had not hoped to be able to invest that city early. The slowness of the mobilization of the Russian army made a certain prudence advisable at the beginning of the campaign. But the great success of his armies in Lemberg encouraged more daring aims. He had invested Przemysl, and Galicia lay before him. Accordingly, he set his face toward Cracow.  Cracow, from a military point of view, is the gate both of Vienna and Berlin. A hundred miles west of it is the famous gap of Moravia, between the Carpathian and the Bohemian mountains, which leads down into Austria. Through this gap runs the great railway connecting Silesia with Vienna, and the Grand Duke knew that if he could capture Cracow he would have an easy road before him to the Austrian capital. Cracow also is the key of Germany.  Seventy miles from the city lies the Oder River. An army might enter Germany by this gate and turn the line of Germany\\'s frontier fortresses. The Oder had been well fortified, but an invader coming from Cracow might move upon the western bank. The Russian plan no doubt was to threaten both enemy capitals. Moreover, an advance of Russia from Cracow would take its armies into Silesia, full of coal and iron mines, and one of the greatest manufacturing districts in the German Empire. This would be a real success, and all Germany would feel the blow.  Another reason for the Russian advance in Galicia was her desire to control the Galician oil wells. To Germany petrol had become one of the foremost munitions of war. Since she could not obtain it from either America or Russia she must get it from Austria, and the Austrian oil fields were all in Galicia. This, in itself, would explain the Galician campaign. Moreover, through the Carpathian Mountains it was possible to make frequent raids into Hungary, and Russia understood well the feeling of Hungary toward her German allies.  She hoped that when Hungary perceived her regiments sacrificed and her plains overrun by Russian troops, she would regret that she had allowed herself to be sacrificed to Prussian ambition. The Russians, therefore, suddenly, moved toward Cracow.  Then von Hindenburg came to the rescue. The supreme command of the Austrian forces was given to him. The defenses of Cracow were strengthened under the direction of the Germans, and a German army advanced from the Posen frontier toward the northern bank of the Vistula. The advance threatened the Russian right, and, accordingly, within ten days\\' march of Cracow, the Russians stopped. The German offensive in Poland had begun. The news of the German advance came about the fifth of October. Von Hindenburg, who had been fighting in East Prussia, had at last perceived that nothing could be gained there. The vulnerable part of Russia was the city of Warsaw. This was the capital of Poland, with a population of about three-quarters of a million. If he could take Warsaw, he would not only have pleasant quarters for the winter but Russia would be so badly injured that no further offensive from her need be anticipated for a long period. Von Hindenburg had with him a large army. In his center he probably had three-quarters of a million men, and on his right the Austrian army in Cracow, which must have reached a million.  Counting the troops operating in East Prussia and along the Carpathians, and the garrison of Przemysl, the Teuton army must have had two and a half million soldiers. Russia, on the other hand, though her mobilization was still continuing, at this time could not have had as many as two million men in the whole nine hundred miles of her battle front.  The fight for Warsaw began Friday, October 16th, and continued for three days, von Hindenburg being personally in command. On Monday the Germans found themselves in trouble. A Russian attack on their left wing had come with crushing force. Von Hindenburg found his left wing thrown back, and the whole German movement thrown into disorder. Meanwhile an attempt to cross the Vistula at Josefov had also been a failure. The Russians allowed the Germans to pass with slight resistance, waited until they arrived at the village Kazimirjev, a district of low hills and swampy flats, and then suddenly overwhelmed them.  Next day the Russians crossed the river themselves, and advanced along the whole line, driving the enemy before them, through great woods of spruce out into the plains on the west. This forest region was well known to the Russian guides, and the Germans suffered much as the Russians had suffered in East Prussia. Ruzsky, the Russian commander, pursued persistently; the Germans retreating first to Kielce, whence they were driven, on the 3d of November, with great losses, and then being broken into two pieces, with the north retiring westward and the south wing southwest toward Cracow.  Rennenkampf\\'s attack on the German left wing was equally successful, and von Hindenburg was driven into full retreat. The only success won during this campaign was that in the far south where Austrian troops were sweeping eastward toward the San. This army drove back the Russians under Ivanov, reoccupied Jaroslav and relieved Przemysl. This was a welcome relief to Przemysl, for the garrison was nearly starved, and it was well for the garrison that the relief came, for in a few days the Russians returned, recaptured Jaroslav and reinvested Przemysl. As von Hindenburg retreated he left complete destruction in his wake, roads, bridges, railroad tracks, water towers, railway stations, all were destroyed; even telegraph posts, broken or sawn through, and insulators broken to bits.  It was now the turn of Russia to make a premature advance, and to pay for it. Doubtless the Grand Duke Nicholas, whose strategy up to this point had been so admirable, knew very well the danger of a new advance in Galicia, but he realized the immense political as well as military advantages which were to be obtained by the capture of Cracow. He therefore attempted to move an army through Poland as well as through Galicia, hoping that the army in Poland would keep von Hindenburg busy, while the Galician army would deal with Cracow.  The advance was slow on account of the damaged Polish roads. It was preceded by a cavalry screen which moved with more speed. On November 10th, the vanguard crossed the Posen frontier and cut the railway on the Cracow-Posen line. This reconnaissance convinced the Russian general that the German army did not propose to make a general stand, and it seemed to him that if he struck strongly with his center along the Warta, he might destroy the left flank of the German southern army, while his own left flank was assaulting Cracow. He believed that even if his attack upon the Warta failed, the Russian center could at any rate prevent the enemy from interfering with the attack further south upon Cracow.  The movement therefore began, and by November 12th, the Russian cavalry had taken Miechow on the German frontier, about twenty miles north of Cracow. Its main forces were still eighty miles to the east. About this time Grand Duke Nicholas perceived that von Hindenburg was preparing a counter stroke. He had retreated north, and then, by means of his railways, was gathering a large army at Thorn. Large reinforcements were sent him, some from the western front, giving him a total of about eight hundred thousand men. In his retreat from Warsaw, while he had destroyed all roads and railways in the south and west, he had carefully preserved those of the north already planning to use them in another movement. He now was beginning an advance, once again, against Warsaw. On account of the roads he perceived that it would be difficult for the Russians to obtain reinforcements. Von Hindenburg had with him as Chief of Staff General von Ludendorff, one of the cleverest staff officers in the German army, and General von Mackensen, a commander of almost equal repute.  The Russian army in the north had been pretty well scattered. The Russian forces were now holding a front of nearly a thousand miles, with about two million men. The Russian right center, which now protected Warsaw from the new attack could hardly number more than two hundred thousand men. Von Hindenburg\\'s aim was Warsaw only, and did not affect directly the Russian advance to Cracow, which was still going on. Indeed, by the end of the first week in December, General Dmitrieff had cavalry in the suburbs of Cracow, and his main force was on the line of the River Rava about twelve miles away. Cracow had been strongly fortified, and much entrenching had been done in a wide circle around the city.   [Illustration: Photograph]   Copyright Press Illustrating Service.

[Illustration: Photograph]   GERMAN FRIGHTFULNESS FROM THE AIR   A gas attack on the eastern front photographed by a Russian airman.   The German plan was to use its field army in Cracow\\'s defense rather than a garrison. Two separate forces were used; one moving southwest of Cracow along the Carpathian hills, struck directly at Ivanov\\'s left; the other, operating from Hungary, threatened the Russian rear. These two divisions struck at the same time and the Russians found it necessary to fight rear actions as they moved forward. They were doing this with reasonable success and working their way toward Cracow, when, on the 12th of December, the Austrian forces working from Hungary carried the Dukla Pass. This meant that the Austrians would be able to pour troops down into the rear of the Russian advance, and the Russian army would be cut off. Dmitrieff, therefore, fell rapidly back, until the opening of the Dukla Pass was in front of his line, and the Russian army was once more safe.  Meanwhile the renewed siege of Przemysl was going on with great vigor, and attracting the general attention of the Allied world. The Austrians attempted to follow up their successes at the Dukla Pass by attempting to seize the Lupkow Pass, and the Uzzok Pass, still further to the east, but the Russians were tired of retreating. New troops had arrived, and about the 20th of December a new advance was begun.  With the right of the army swinging up along the river Nida, northeast of Cracow, the Russian left attacked the Dukla Pass in great force, driving Austrians back and capturing over ten thousand men. On Christmas Day all three great western passes were in Russian hands. The Austrian fighting, during this period, was the best they had so far shown, the brunt of it being upon the Hungarian troops, who, at this time, were saving Germany.  Meantime von Hindenburg was pursuing his movement in the direction of Warsaw. The Russian generals found it difficult to obtain information. Each day came the chronicle of contests, some victories, some defeats, and it soon appeared that a strong force was crushing in the Russian outposts from the direction of Thorn and moving toward Warsaw. Ruzsky found himself faced by a superior German force, and was compelled to retreat. The Russian aim was to fall back behind the river Bzura, which lies between the Thorn and Warsaw. Bzura is a strong line of defense, with many fords but no bridges. The Russian right wing passed by the city of Lowicz, moved southwest to Strykov and then on past Lodz. West of Lowicz is a great belt of marshes impossible for the movement of armies.  The first German objective was the city of Lodz. Von Hindenburg knew that he must move quickly before the Russians should get up reserves. His campaign of destruction had made it impossible for aid to be sent to the Russian armies from Ivanov, far in the south, but every moment counted. His right pushed forward and won the western crossings of the marshes. His extreme left moved towards Plock, but the main effort was against Piontek, where there is a famous causeway engineered for heavy transport through the marshes.  At first the Russians repelled the attack on the causeway, but on November 19th the Russians broke and were compelled to fall back. Over the causeway, then, the German troops were rushed in great numbers, splitting the Russian army into two parts; one on the south surrounding Lodz, and the other running east of Brezin on to the Vistula. The Russian army around Lodz was assailed on the front flank and rear. It looked like an overwhelming defeat for the Russian army. At the very last moment possible, Russian reinforcements appeared--a body of Siberians from the direction of Warsaw. They were thrown at once into the battle and succeeded in re-establishing the Russian line. This left about ninety thousand Germans almost entirely surrounded, as if they were in a huge sack. Ruzsky tried his best to close the mouth of the sack, but he was unsuccessful. The fighting was terrific, but by the 26th the Germans in the sack had escaped.  The Germans were continually receiving reinforcements and still largely outnumbered the Russians. Von Hindenburg therefore determined on a new assault. The German left wing was now far in front of the Russian city of Lodz, one of the most important of the Polish cities. The population was about half a million. Such a place was a constant danger, for it was the foundation of a Russian salient.  When the German movement began the Russian general, perceiving how difficult it would have been to hold the city, deliberately withdrew, and on December 6th the Germans entered Lodz without opposition.  The retreat relieved the Russians of a great embarrassment. Its capture was considered in Germany as a great German victory, and at this time von Hindenburg seems to have felt that he had control of the situation. His movement, to be sure, had not interfered with the Russian advance on Cracow, but Warsaw must have seemed to him almost in his power. He therefore concentrated his forces for a blow at Warsaw. His first new movement was directed at the Russian right wing, which was then north of the Bzura River and east of Lowicz. He also directed the German forces in East Prussia to advance and attempted to cut the main railway line between Warsaw and Petrograd. If this attempt had been successful it would have been a highly serious matter for the Russians. The Russians, however, defeated it, and drove the enemy back to the East Prussian border. The movement against the Russian right wing was more successful, and the Russians fell back slowly. This was not because they were defeated in battle, but because the difficult weather interfered with communications. There had been a thaw, and the whole country was waterlogged. The Grand Duke was willing that the Germans should fight in the mud.  This slow retreat continued from the 7th of December to Christmas Eve, and involved the surrender of a number of Polish towns, but it left the Russians in a strong position. They were able to entrench themselves so that every attack of the enemy was broken. The Germans tried hard. Von Hindenburg would have liked to enter Warsaw on Christmas. The citizens heard day and night the sound of the cannon, but they were entirely safe.  The German attack was a failure. On the whole, the Grand Duke Nicholas had shown better strategy than the best of the German generals. Outnumbered from the very start, his tactics had been admirable. Twice he had saved Warsaw, and he was still threatening Cracow. The Russian armies were fighting with courage and efficiency, and were continually growing in numbers as the days went by.  During the first weeks of 1915 while there were a number of attacks and counter attacks both armies had come to the trench warfare, so familiar in France. The Germans in particular had constructed a most elaborate trench system, with underground rooms containing many of the ordinary comforts of life. Toward the end of the month the Russians began to move in East Prussia in the north and also far south in the Bukovina. The object of these movements was probably to prevent von Hindenburg from releasing forces on the west. Russia was still terribly weak in equipment and was not ready for a serious advance. An attack on sacred East Prussia would stir up the Germans, while Hungary would be likewise disturbed by the advance on Bukovina. Von Hindenburg, however, was still full of the idea of capturing Warsaw. He had failed twice but the old Field Marshal was stubborn and moreover he knew well what the capture of Warsaw would mean to Russia, and so he tried again.  The Russian front now followed the west bank of the Bzura for a few miles, changed to the eastern bank following the river until it met with the Rawka, from there a line of trenches passed south and east of Balinov and from there to Skiernievice. Von Mackensen concentrated a considerable army at Balinov and had on the 1st of February about a hundred and forty thousand men there. That night, with the usual artillery preparation, he moved from Balinov against the Russian position at the Borzymov Crest. The Germans lost heavily but drove forward into the enemy\\'s line, and by the 3d of February had almost made a breach in it. This point, however, could be readily reinforced and troops were hurried there from Warsaw in such force that on February 4th the German advance was checked. Von Mackensen had lost heavily, and by the time it was checked he had become so weak that his forces yielded quickly to the counter-attack and were flung back.  This was the last frontal attack upon Warsaw. Von Hindenburg then determined to attack Warsaw by indirection. Austria was instructed to move forward along the whole Carpathian front, while he himself, with strong forces, undertook to move from East Prussia behind the Polish capital, and cut the communications between Warsaw and Petrograd. If Austria could succeed, Przemysl might be relieved, Lemberg recaptured, and Russia forced back so far on the south that Warsaw would have to be abandoned. On the other hand if the East Prussia effort were successful, the Polish capital would certainly fall. These plans, if they had developed successfully, would have crippled the power of Russia for at least six months. Meantime, troops could be sent to the west front, and perhaps enable Germany to overwhelm France. By this time almost all of Poland west of the Vistula was in the power of the Germans, while three-fourths of Galicia was controlled by Russia.  Von Hindenburg now returned to his old battle-ground near the Masurian Lakes. The Russian forces, which, at the end of January, had made a forward movement in East Prussia, had been quite successful. Their right was close upon Tilsit, and their left rested upon the town of Johannisburg. Further south was the Russian army of the Narev. Von Hindenburg determined to surprise the invaders, and he gathered an army of about three hundred thousand men to face the Russian forces which did not number more than a hundred and twenty thousand, and which were under the command of General Baron Sievers. The Russian army soon found itself in a desperate position. A series of bitter fights ensued, at some of which the Kaiser himself was present. The Russians were driven steadily back for a week, but the German stories of their tremendous losses are obviously unfounded. They retreated steadily until February 20th, fighting courageously, and by that date the Germans began to find themselves exhausted.  Russian reinforcements came up, and a counter-attack was begun. The German aim had evidently been to reach Grodno and cut the main line from Warsaw to Petrograd, which passes through that city. They had now reached Suwalki, a little north of Grodno, but were unable to advance further, though the Warsaw-Petrograd railway was barely ten miles away. The southern portion of von Hindenburg\\'s army was moving against the railway further west, in the direction of Ossowietz. But Ossowietz put up a determined resistance, and the attack was unsuccessful. By the beginning of March, von Hindenburg ordered a gradual retreat to the East Prussian frontier.  While this movement to drive the Russians from East Prussia was under way, von Hindenburg had also launched an attack against the Russian army on the Narev. If he could force the lower Narev from that point, too, he could cut the railroad running east from the Polish capital. He had hoped that the attacks just described further east would distract the Russian attention so that he would find the Narev ill guarded. The advance began on February 22d, and after numerous battles captured Przasnysz, and found itself with only one division to oppose its progress to the railroad. On the 23d this force was attacked by the German right, but resisted with the utmost courage. It held out for more than thirty-six hours, until, on the evening of the 24th, Russian reinforcements began to come up, and drove the invaders north through Przasnysz in retreat.  It was an extraordinary fight. The Russians were unable to supply all their troops with munitions and arms. At Przasnysz men fought without rifles, armed only with a bayonet. All they could do was to charge with cold steel, and they did it so desperately that, though they were outnumbered, they drove the Germans before them. By all the laws of war the Russians should have been defeated with ease. As it was, the German attempt to capture Warsaw by a flank movement was defeated. While the struggle was going on in the north, the Austrian armies in Galicia were also moving, Russia was still holding the three great passes in the Carpathian Mountains, but had not been able to begin an offensive in Hungary.  The Austrians had been largely reinforced by German troops, and were moving forward to the relief of Przemysl, and also to drive Brussilov from the Galician mountains. Brussilov\\'s movements had been partly military and partly political. From the passes in those mountains Hungary could be attacked, and unless he could be driven away there was no security for the Hungarian cornfields, to which Germany was looking for food supplies. Moreover, from the beginning of the Russian movement in Galicia, northern Bukovina had been in Russian hands. Bukovina was not only a great supply ground for petrol and grain, but she adjoined Roumania which, while still neutral, had a strong sympathy with the Allies, especially Italy. The presence of a Russian army on her border might encourage her to join the Allies. Austria naturally desired to free Roumania from this pressure. The leading Austrian statesmen, at this time, were especially interested in Hungary. The Austrian Minister of Foreign Affairs was Baron Stephen Burian, the Hungarian diplomatist, belonging to the party of the Hungarian Premier, Count Tisza. It was his own country that was threatened. The prizes of a victorious campaign were therefore great.  The campaign began in January amid the deepest snow, and continued during February in the midst of blizzards. The Austrians were divided into three separate armies. The first was charged with the relief of Przemysl. The second advanced in the direction of Lemberg, and the third moved upon Bukovina. The first made very little progress, after a number of lively battles. It was held pretty safely by Brussilov. The second army was checked by Dmitrieff. Further east, however, the army of the Bukovina crossed the Carpathian range, and made considerable advances. This campaign was fought out in a great number of battles, the most serious of which, perhaps, was the battle of Koziowa. At that point Brussilov\\'s center withstood for several days the Austrian second army which was commanded by the German General von Linsengen. The Russian success here saved Lemberg, prevented the relief of Przemysl and gave time to send reinforcements into Bukovina.  The Austrian third army, moving on Bukovina, had the greatest Austrian success. They captured in succession Czernowitz, Kolomea, and Stanislau. They did not succeed, however, in driving the Russians from the province. The Russians retired slowly, waiting for reinforcements. These reinforcements came, whereupon the Austrians were pushed steadily back. The passes in the Carpathians still remained in Austrian hands, but Przemysl was not relieved or Lemberg recaptured. On March 22d Przemysl fell.  The capture of Przemysl was the greatest success that Russia had so far attained. It had been besieged for about four months, and the taking of the fortress was hailed as the first spectacular success of the war. Its capture altered the whole situation. It released a large Russian army, which was sent to reinforce the armies of Ivanov, where the Austrians were vigorously attacked.  By the end of March the Russians had captured the last Austrian position on the Lupkow pass and were attacking vigorously the pass of Uzzok, which maintained a stubborn defense. Brussilov tried to push his way to the rear of the Uzzok position, and though the Austrians delivered a vigorous counter-attack they were ultimately defeated. In five weeks of fighting Ivanov captured over seventy thousand prisoners.  During this period there was considerable activity in East Prussia, and the Courland coast was bombarded by the German Baltic squadron. There was every indication that Austria was near collapse, but all the time the Germans were preparing for a mighty effort, and the secret was kept with extraordinary success. The little conflicts in the Carpathians and in East Prussia were meant to deceive, while a great army, with an enormous number of guns of every caliber, and masses of ammunition, were being gathered. The Russian commanders were completely deceived. There had been no change in the generals in command except that General Ruzsky, on account of illness, was succeeded by General Alexeiev. The new German army was put under the charge of von Hindenburg\\'s former lieutenant, General von Mackensen. This was probably the strongest army that Germany ever gathered, and could not have numbered less than two millions of men, with nearly two thousand pieces in its heavy batteries.  On April 28th, the action began. The Austro-German army lay along the left of the Donajetz River to its junction with the Biala, and along the Biala to the Carpathian Mountains. Von Mackensen\\'s right moved in the direction of Gorlice. General Dmitrieff was compelled to weaken his front to protect Gorlice and then, on Saturday, the 1st of May, the great attack began. Under cover of artillery fire such as had never been seen before bridges were pushed across the Biala and Ciezkowice was taken. The Russian positions were blown out of existence. The Russian armies did what they could but their defense collapsed and they were soon in full retreat.  The German armies advanced steadily, and though the Russians made a brave stand at many places they could do nothing. On the Wisloka they hung on for five days, but they were attempting an impossibility. From that time on each day marked a new German victory, and in spite of the most desperate fighting the Russians were forced back until, on the 11th, the bulk of their line lay just west of the lower San as far as Przemysl and then south to the upper Dniester. The armies were in retreat, but were not routed. In a fortnight the army of Dmitrieff had fallen back eighty-five miles.  The Grand Duke Nicholas by this time understood the situation. He perceived that it was impossible to make a stand. The only thing to do was to retreat steadily until Germany\\'s mass of war material should be used up, even though miles of territory should be sacrificed. It should be a retreat in close contact with the enemy, so that the Austro-German troops would have to fight for every mile. This meant a retreat not for days, but perhaps for weeks. It meant that Przemysl must be given up, and Lemberg, and even Warsaw, but the safety of the Russian army was of more importance than a province or a city.  On May 18th the German War Office announced their successes in the following terms: \"The army under General von Mackensen in the course of its pursuit of the Russians reached yesterday the neighborhood of Subiecko, on the lower Wisloka, and Kolbuezowa, northeast of Debica. Under the pressure of this advance the Russians also retreated from their positions north of the Vistula. In this section the troops under General von Woyrach, closely following the enemy, penetrated as far as the region northwest of Kielce. In the Carpathians Austro-Hungarian and German troops under General von Linsingen conquered the hills east of the Upper Stryi, and took 3,660 men prisoners, as well as capturing six machine guns. At the present moment, while the armies under General von Mackensen are approaching the Przemysl fortresses and the lower San, it is possible to form an approximate idea of the booty taken. In the battles of Tarno and Gorlika, and in the battles during the pursuit of these armies, we have so far taken 103,500 Russian prisoners, 69 cannon, and 255 machine guns. In these figures the booty taken by the Allied troops fighting in the Carpathians, and north of the Vistula, is not included. This amounts to a further 40,000 prisoners. Przemysl surrendered to the German\\'s on June 3, 1915, only ten weeks after the Russian capture of the fortress, which had caused such exultation.\"  General von Mackensen continued toward Lemberg, the capital of Galicia. On June 18th, when the victorious German armies were approaching the gates of Lemberg, the Russian losses were estimated at 400,000 dead and wounded, and 300,000 prisoners, besides 100,000 lost before Marshal von Hindenburg\\'s forces in Poland and Courland. On June 23d Lemberg fell. The weakness of Russia in this campaign arose from the exhaustion of her ammunition supplies, but great shipments of such supplies were being constantly forwarded from Vladivostock.  When the German army crossed the San, Wilhelm II, then German Emperor, was present. It is interesting to look back on the scene. Here is a paragraph from the account of the Wolff Telegraphic Bureau: \"The Emperor had hurried forward to his troops by automobile. On the way he was greeted with loud hurrahs by the wounded, riding back in wagons. On the heights of Jaroslav the Emperor met Prince Eitel Friedrich, and then, from several points of observation, for hours followed with keen attention the progress of the battle for the crossing.\"  While the great offensive in Galicia was well under way, the Germans were pushing forward in East Prussia. Finding little resistance they ultimately invaded Courland, captured Libau, and established themselves firmly in that province. The sweep of the victorious German armies through Galicia was continued into Poland. On July 19th William the War Lord bombastically telegraphed his sister, the Queen of Greece, to the effect that he had \"paralyzed Russia for at least six months to come\" and was on the eve of \"delivering a coup on the western front that will make all Europe tremble.\"  It would be futile to recount the details of the various German victories which followed the advance into Poland. On July 24th, the German line ran from Novgorod in the north, south of Przasnysz, thence to Novogeorgievsk, then swinging to the southeast below Warsaw it passed close to the west of Ivangorad, Lublin, Chelm, and then south to a point just east of Lemberg. Warsaw at that time was in the jaws of the German nutcracker.  On July 21st, the bells in all the churches throughout Russia clanged a call to prayer for twenty-four hours\\' continual service of intercession for victory. In spite of the heat the churches were packed. Hour after hour the people stood wedged together, while the priests and choirs chanted their litanies. Outside the Kamian Cathedral an open-air mass was celebrated in the presence of an enormous crowd. But the German victories continued.  On August 5th Warsaw was abandoned. Up to July 29th hope was entertained in military quarters in London and Paris that the Germans would stand a siege in their fortresses along the Warsaw salient, but on that date advices came from Petrograd that in order to save the Russian armies a retreat must be made, and the Warsaw fortresses abandoned. For some time before this the Russian resistance had perceptibly stiffened, and many vigorous counter-attacks had been made against the German advance, but it was the same old story, the lack of ammunition. The armies were compelled to retire and await the munitions necessary for a new offensive.  The last days of Russian rule in Warsaw were days of extraordinary interest. The inhabitants, to the number of nearly half a million, sought refuge in Russia. All goods that could be useful to the Germans were either removed or burned. Crops were destroyed in the surrounding fields. When the Germans entered they found an empty and deserted city, with only a few Poles and the lowest classes of Jews still left. Warsaw is a famous city, full of ancient palaces, tastefully, adorned shops, finely built streets, and fourscore church towers where the bells are accustomed to ring melodiously for matins and vespers. In the Ujazdowske Avenue one comes to the most charming building in all Warsaw, the Lazienki Palace, with its delicious gardens mirrored in a lovely lake. It is a beautiful city.  The fall of Warsaw meant the fall of Russian Poland, but Russia was not yet defeated. Von Hindenburg was to be treated as Napoleon was in 1812, The strategy of the Grand Duke was sound; so long as he could save the army the victories of Germany would be futile. It is true that the German armies were not compelled, like those of Napoleon, to live on the land. They could bring their supplies from Berlin day by day, but every mile they advanced into hostile territory made their task harder. The German line of communication, as it grew longer, became weaker and the troops needed for garrison duty in the captured towns, seriously diminished the strength of the fighting army, The Russian retreat was good strategy and it was carried on with extraordinary cleverness.  It is unnecessary to describe the events which succeeded the fall of Warsaw in great detail. There was a constant succession of German victories and Russian defeats, but never one of the Russian armies enveloped or destroyed. Back they went, day after day, always fighting; each great Russian fortress resisted until it saw itself in danger, and then safely withdrew its troops. Kovno fell and Novogeorgievsk, and Ivangorad, then Ossowietz was abandoned, and Brest-Litovsk and Grodno.  On September 5th the Emperor of Russia signed the following order:   Today I have taken supreme command of all the forces of the sea and land armies operating in the theater of war. With firm faith in the clemency of God, with unshakable assurance in final victory, we shall fulfil our sacred duty to defend our country to the last. We will not dishonor the Russian land.   The Grand Duke Nicholas was made Viceroy of the Caucasus, a post which took him out of the main theater of fighting but gave him a great field for fresh military activity. He had been bearing a heavy burden, and had shown himself to be a great commander. He had outmaneuvered von Hindenberg again and again, and though finally the Russian armies under his command had been driven back, the retreat itself was a proof of his military ability, not only in its conception, but in the way in which it was done.  The Emperor chose General Alexieff as his Chief of General Staff. He was the ablest of the great generals who had been leading the Russian army. With this change in command a new spirit seemed to come over Russia. The German advance, however, was not yet completely checked. It was approaching Vilna.  The fighting around Vilna was the bitterest in the whole long retreat. On the 18th of September it fell, but the Russian troops were safely removed and the Russian resistance had become strong. Munitions were pouring into the new Russian army. The news from the battle-front began to show improvement. On September 8th General Brussilov, further in the south, had attacked the Germans in front of Tarnopol, and defeated them with heavy loss. More than seventeen thousand men were captured with much artillery. Soon the news came of other advances. Dubno was retaken and Lutsk.  The end of September saw the German advance definitely checked. The Russian forces were now extended in a line from Riga on the north, along the river Dvina, down to Dvinsk. Then turning to the east along the river, it again turned south and so on down east of the Pripet Marshes, it followed an almost straight line to the southern frontier. Its two strongest points were Riga, on the Gulf of Riga, which lay under the protection of the guns of the fleet, and Dvinsk, through which ran the great Petrograd Railway line. Against these two points von Hindenburg directed his attack. And now, for the first time in many months, he met with complete failure. The German fleet attempted to assist him on the Gulf of Riga, but was defeated by the Russian Baltic fleet with heavy losses. A bombardment turned out a failure and the German armies were compelled to retire.   [Illustration: Map: Riga and Surroundings.]   THE GERMAN ATTACK ON THE ROAD TO PETROGRAD   A more serious effort was made against Dvinsk but was equally unsuccessful and the German losses were immense. Again and again the attempt was made to cross the Dvina River, but without success; the German invasion was definitely stopped. By the end of October there was complete stagnation in the northern sector of the battle line, and though in November there were a number of battles, nothing happened of great importance.  During the year 1916 the Russian armies seemed to have had a new birth. At last they were supplied with guns and munitions. They waited until they were ready. In March a series of battles was fought in the neighborhood of Lake Narotch, and eight successive attacks were made against the German army, intrenched between Lake Narotch and Lake Vischenebski. The Germans at first were driven back and badly defeated. Later on, however, the Russian artillery was sent to another section, and the Germans were able to recover their position. During June the Russians attacked all along the southern part of their line. In three weeks they had regained a whole province. Lutsk and Dubno had been retaken; two hundred thousand men and hundreds of guns, had been captured, and the Austrian line had been pierced and shattered. Further south the German army had been compelled to retreat and the Russian armies were in Bukovina and Galicia. On the 10th of August Stanislau fell.  By this time two Austrian armies had been shattered, over three hundred and fifty thousand prisoners taken, and nearly a million men put out of action. Germany, however, was sending reinforcements as fast as possible, and putting up a desperate defense. Nevertheless everything was encouraging for Russia and she entered upon the winter in a very different condition from her condition in the previous year. Then she had just ended her great retreat. Now she had behind her a series of successes. But a new difficulty had arisen in the loss of the political harmony at home which had marked the first years of the war. Dark days were ahead.    CHAPTER XXII  HOW THE BALKANS DECIDED   For more than half a century the Balkans have presented a problem which  disturbed the minds of the statesmen of Europe. Again and again, during  that period, it seemed that in the Balkan mountains might be kindled a  blaze which might set the world afire. Balkan politics is a labyrinth  in which one might easily be lost. The inhabitants of the Balkans  represent many races, each with its own ambition, and, for the most  part, military. There were Serbs, and Bulgarians, and Turks, and  Roumanians, and Greeks, and their territorial divisions did not  correspond to their nationalities. The land was largely mountainous,  with great gaps that make it, in a sense, the highway of the world.  From 1466 to 1878 the Balkans was in the dominion of the Turks. In the  early days while the Turks were warring against Hungary, their armies  marched through the Balkan hills. The natives kept apart, and preserved  their language, religion and customs.  In the nineteenth century, as the Turks grew weaker, their subject people began to seek independence. Greece came first, and, in 1829, aided by France, Russia and Great Britain, she became an independent kingdom. Serbia revolted in 1804, and by 1820 was an autonomous state, though still tributary to Turkey. In 1859, Roumania became autonomous. The rising of Bulgaria in 1876, however, was really the beginning of the succession of events which ultimately led to the World War of 1914-18. The Bulgarian insurrection was crushed by the Turks in such a way as to stir the indignation of the whole world. What are known as the \"Bulgarian Atrocities\" seem mild today, but they led to the Russo-Turkish War in 1877.  The treaty of Berlin, by which that war was settled in 1878, was one of those treaties which could only lead to trouble. It deprived Russia of much of the benefit of her victory, and left nearly every racial question unsettled. Roumania lost Bessarabia, which was mainly inhabited by Roumanians. Bosnia and Herzegovina were handed over to the administration of Austria. Turkey was allowed to retain Macedonia, Albania and Thrace. Serbia was given Nish, but had no outlet to the sea. Greece obtained Thessaly, and a new province was made of the country south of the Balkans called Eastern Rumelia. From that time on, quarrel after quarrel made up the history of the Balkan peoples, each of whom sought the assistance and support of some one of the great powers. Russia and Austria were constantly intriguing with the new states, in the hope of extending their own domains in the direction of Constantinople.  The history of Bulgaria shows that that nation has been continually the center of these intrigues. In 1879 they elected as their sovereign Prince Alexander of Battenburg, whose career might almost be called romantic. A splendid soldier and an accomplished gentleman, he stands out as an interesting figure in the sordid politics of the Balkans. He identified himself with his new country. In 1885 he brought about a union with Eastern Rumelia, which led to a disagreement with Russia.  Serbia, doubtless at Russian instigation, suddenly declared war, but was overwhelmed by Prince Alexander in short order. Russia then abducted Prince Alexander, but later was forced to restore him. However, Russian intrigues, and his failure to obtain support from one of the great powers, forced his abdication in 1886.  In 1887 Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha became the Prince of Bulgaria. He, also, was a remarkable man, but not the romantic of his predecessor. He seems to have been a sort of a parody of a king. He was fond of ostentation, and full of ambition. He was a personal coward, but extremely cunning. During his long reign he built up Bulgaria into a powerful, independent kingdom, and even assumed the title of Czar of Bulgaria. During the first days of his reign he was kept safely on the throne by his mother, the Princess Clementine, a daughter of Louis Phillippe, who, according to Gladstone, was the cleverest woman in Europe, and for a few years Bulgaria was at peace. In 1908 he declared Bulgaria independent, and its independence was recognized by Turkey on the payment of an indemnity. During this period Russia was the protector of Bulgaria, but the Bulgarian fox was looking also for the aid of Austria. Serbia more and more relied upon Russia.

[Illustration: Photograph: Soldier working on a telephone connection.]   Copyright Underwood and Underwood, N. Y.   British Official Photo   THE NERVE-SYSTEM OF THE FIGHTING ARMIES   What the nerves are to the human body the signal system was to the   armies, transmitting warnings of danger from the outposts to a central   brain, and flashing back the thing to be done to meet it.   The Austrian treatment of the Slavs was a source of constant irritation to Serbia. Roumania had a divided feeling. Her loss of Bessarabia to Russia had caused ill feeling, but in Austria\\'s province of Transylvania there were millions of Roumanians, whom Roumania desired to bring under her rule. Greece was fearful of Russia, because of Russia\\'s desire for the control of Constantinople. All of these nations, too, were deeply conscious of the Austro-German ambitions for extension of their power through to the East. Each of these principalities was also jealous of the other. Bulgaria and Serbia had been at war; many Bulgarians were in the Roumanian territory, many Serbians, Bulgarians and Greeks in Macedonia. There was only one tie in common, that was their hatred of Turkey. In 1912 a league was formed, under the direction of the Greek statesman, Venizelos, having for its object an attack on Turkey. By secret treaties arrangements were made for the division of the land, which they hoped to obtain from Turkey.  War was declared, and Turkey was decisively defeated, and then the trouble began. Serbia and Bulgaria had been particularly anxious for an outlet to the sea, and in the treaty between them it had been arranged that Serbia should have an outlet on the Adriatic, while Bulgaria was to obtain an outlet on the AEgean. The Triple Alliance positively refused Serbia its share of the Adriatic coast. Serbia insisted, therefore, on a revision of the treaty, which would enable her to have a seaport on the AEgean.  An attempt was made to settle the question by arbitration, but King Ferdinand refused, whereupon, in July, 1913, the Second Balkan War began. Bulgaria was attacked by Greece and Serbia, and Turkey took a chance and regained Adrianople, and even Roumania, which had been neutral in the First Baltic War, mobilized her armies and marched toward Sofia. Bulgaria surrendered, and on the 10th of August the Treaty of Bucharest was signed by the Balkan States.  As a result of this Bulgaria was left in a thoroughly dissatisfied state of mind. She had been the leader in the war against Turkey, she had suffered heavy losses, and she had gained almost nothing. Moreover she had lost to Roumania, a territory containing a quarter of a million Bulgarians, and a splendid harbor on the Black Sea. Serbia and Greece were the big winners. Such a treaty could not be a final settlement. The Balkans were left seething with unrest. Serbia, though she had gained much, was still dissatisfied. Her ambitions, however, now turned in the direction of the Jugoslavs under the rule of Austria, and it was her agitation in this matter which directly brought on the Great War. But Bulgaria was sullen and ready for revenge. When the Great War began, therefore, Roumania, Serbia, Montenegro and Greece were strongly in sympathy with Russia, who had been their backer and friend. Bulgaria, in spite of all she owed to Russia in the early days, was now ready to find protection from an alliance with the Central Powers. Her feeling was well known to the Allies, and every effort was made to obtain her friendship and, if possible, her aid.  Viviani, then Premier of France, in an address before the French Chamber of Deputies, said:   The Balkan question was raised at the outset of the war, even before it came to the attention of the world. The Bucharest Treaty had left in Bulgaria profound heartburnings. Neither King nor people were resigned to the loss of the fruits of their efforts and sacrifices, and to the consequences of the unjustifiable war they had waged upon their former allies. From the first day, the Allied governments took into account the dangers of such a situation, and sought a means to remedy it. Their policy has proceeded in a spirit of justice and generosity which has characterized the attitude of Great Britain, Russia and Italy as well as France. We have attempted to re-establish the union of the Baltic peoples, and in accord with them seek the realization of their principal national aspirations. The equilibrium thus obtained by mutual sacrifices really made by each would have been the best guarantee of future peace. Despite constant efforts in which Roumania, Greece and Serbia lent their assistance, we have been unable to obtain the sincere collaboration of the Bulgarian Government. The difficulties respecting the negotiations were always at Sofia.   At the beginning of the war it appears, therefore, that Bulgaria was entering into negotiations with the Allies, hoping to regain in this way, some of the territory she had lost in the Second Baltic War. Many of her leading statesmen and most distinguished generals favored the cause of Russia, but in May came the great German advance in Galicia, and the Allies\\' stalemate in the Dardanelles, and the king, and his supporters, found the way clear for a movement in favor of Germany. Still protesting neutrality they signed a secret treaty with Berlin, Vienna and Constantinople on July 17th. The Central Powers had promised them not only what they had been asking, in Macedonia, but also the Greek territory of Epirus. This treaty was concealed from those Bulgarian leaders who still held to Russia, and on the 5th of October Bulgaria formally entered into war on the side of Germany, and began an attack on Serbia.  The full account of the intrigue which led to this action has never been told. It is not improbable that King Ferdinand himself never had any other idea than to act as he did, but he dissembled for a long time. He set forth his claims in detail to the Allies, who used every effort to induce Roumania, Greece and Serbia to make the concessions that would be necessary. Such concessions were made, but not until it was too late. In a telegram from Milan dated September 24th, an account is given of an interview between Czar Ferdinand and a committee from those Bulgarians who were opposed to the King\\'s policy.  \"Mind your own head. I shall mind mine!\" are the words which the King spoke to M. Stambulivski when he received the five opposition members who had come to warn him of the danger to which he was exposing himself and the nation.  The five members were received by the King in the red room at the Royal Palace and chairs had been placed for them around a big table. The King entered the room, accompanied by Prince Boris, the heir apparent, and his secretary, M. Boocovitch.  \"Be seated, gentlemen,\" said the King, as he sat down himself, as if for a very quiet talk. His secretary took a seat at the table, a little apart to take notes, but the conversation immediately became so heated and rapid that he was unable to write it down.  The first to speak was M. Malinoff, leader of the Democratic party, who said: \"The policy adopted by the Government is one of adventure, tending to throw Bulgaria into the arms of Germany, and driving her to attack Serbia. This policy is contrary to the aspirations, feeling and interests of the country, and if the Government obstinately continues in this way it will provoke disturbances of the greatest gravity.\" It was the first allusion to the possibility of a revolution, but the King listened without flinching. M. Malinoff concluded: \"For these reasons we beg your Majesty, after having vainly asked the Government, to convoke the Chamber immediately, and we ask this convocation for the precise object of saving the country from dangerous adventures by the formation of a coalition Ministry.\"  The King remained silent, and, with a nod, invited M. Stambulivski to speak. M. Stambulivski was a leader of the Agrarian party, a man of sturdy, rustic appearance, accustomed to speak out his mind boldly, and exceedingly popular among the peasant population. He grew up himself as a peasant, and wore the laborer\\'s blouse up till very recently. He stood up and looking the King straight in the face said in resolute tones: \"In the name of every farmer in Bulgaria I add to what M. Malinoff has just said, that the Bulgarian people hold you personally responsible more than your Government, for the disastrous adventure of 1913. If a similar adventure were to be repeated now its gravity this time would be irreparable. The responsibility would once more fall on your policy, which is contrary to the welfare of our country, and the nation would not hesitate to call you personally to account. That there may be no mistake as to the real wishes of the country I present to your Majesty my country\\'s demand in writing.\"  He handed the King a letter containing the resolution voted by the Agrarians. The King read it and then turned to M. Zanoff, leader of the Radical Democrats, and asked him to speak. M. Zanoff did so, speaking very slowly and impressively, and also looking the King straight in the face: \"Sire, I had sworn never again to set foot inside your palace, and if I come today it is because the interests of my country are above personal questions, and have compelled me. Your Majesty may read what I have to say in this letter, which I submit to you in behalf of our party.\"  He handed the letter and the King read it and still remained silent. Then he said, turning to his former Prime Minister and ablest politician: \"Gueshoff, it is now your turn to speak.\"  M. Gueshoff got up and said: \"I also am fully in accord with what M. Stambulivski has just said. No matter how severe his words may have been in their simple unpolished frankness, which ignores the ordinary formalities of etiquette, they entirely express our unanimous opinion. We all, as representing the opposition, consider the present policy of the Government contrary to the sentiments and interests of the country, because by driving it to make common cause with Germany it makes us the enemies of Russia, which was our deliverer, and the adventure into which we are thus thrown compromises our future. We disapprove most absolutely of such a policy, and we also ask that the Chamber be convoked, and a Ministry formed with the co-operation of all parties.\"  After M. Gueshoff, the former Premier, M. Daneff also spoke, and associated himself with what had already been said.  The King remained still silent for a while, then he, also, stood up and said: \"Gentlemen, I have listened to your threats, and will refer them to the President of the Council of Ministers, that he may know and decide what to do.\"  All present bowed, and a chilly silence followed. The King had evidently taken the frank warning given him as a threat to him personally, and he walked up and down nervously for a while. Prince Boris turned aside to talk with the Secretary, who had resumed taking notes. The King continued pacing to and fro, evidently very nettled. Then, approaching M. Zanoff, and as if to change the conversation, he asked him for news about this season\\'s harvest.  M. Zanoff abruptly replied: \"Your Majesty knows that we have not come here to talk about the harvest, but of something far more important at present, namely, the policy of your Government, which is on the point of ruining our country. We can on no account approve the policy that is anti-Russian. If the Crown and M. Radoslavoff persist in their policy we shall not answer for the consequences. We have not desired to seek out those responsible for the disaster of 1913, because other grave events have been precipitated. But it was a disaster due to criminal folly. It must not be repeated by an attack on Serbia by Bulgaria, as seems contemplated by M. Radoslavoff, and which according to all appearances, has the approval of your Majesty. It would be a premeditated crime, and deserve to be punished.\"  The King hesitated a moment, and then held out his hand to M. Zanoff, saying: \"All right. At all events I thank you for your frankness.\" Then, approaching M. Stambulivski, he repeated to him his question about the harvest.  M. Stambulivski, as a simple peasant, at first allowed himself to be led into a discussion of this secondary matter, and had expressed the hope that the prohibition on the export of cereals would be removed, when he suddenly remembered, and said:  \"But this is not the moment to speak of these things. I again repeat to your Majesty that the country does not want a policy of adventure which cost it so dear in 1913. It was your own policy too. Before 1913 we thought you were a great diplomatist, but since then we have seen what fruits your diplomacy bears. You took advantage of all the loopholes in the Constitution to direct the country according to your own views. Your Ministers are nothing. You alone are the author of this policy and you will have to bear the responsibility.\"  The King replied frigidly, \"The policy which I have decided to follow is that which I consider the best for the welfare of the country.\"  \"It is a policy which will only bring misfortune,\" replied the sturdy Agrarian. \"It will lead to fresh catastrophes, and compromise not only the future of our country, but that of your dynasty, and may cost you your head.\"  It was as bold a saying as ever was uttered before a King, and Ferdinand looked astonished at the peasant who was thus speaking to him. He said, \"Do not mind my head; it is already old. Rather mind your own!\" he added with a disdainful smile, and turned away.  M. Stambulivski retorted: \"My head matters little, Sire. What matters more is the good of our country.\"  The King paid no more attention to him, and took M. Gueshoff and M. Danoff apart, who again insisted on convoking the Chamber, and assured him that M. Radoslavoff\\'s government would be in a minority. They also referred to the Premier\\'s oracular utterances.  \"Ah!\" said the King. \"Has Radoslavoff spoken to you, and what has he said?\"  \"He has said--\" replied the leaders, \"that Bulgaria would march with Germany and attack Serbia.\"  The King made a vague gesture, and then said: \"Oh, I did not know.\"  This incident throws a strong light upon the conflict which was going on in the Balkan states, between those Kings who were of German origin, and who believed in the German power, and their people who loved Russia. King Ferdinand got his warning. He did not listen, and he lost his throne. All this, however, took place before the Bulgarian declaration of war. Yet much had already shown what King Ferdinand was about to do. The Allies, to be sure, were incredulous, and were doing their best to cultivate the good will of the treacherous King, On September 23rd the official order was given for Bulgaria\\'s mobilization. She, however, officially declared that her position was that of armed neutrality and that she had no aggressive intentions. As it has developed, she was acting under the direction of the German High Command.  It was at this period that Germany had failed to crush Russia in the struggle on the Vilna, and, in accordance with her usual strategy when one plan failed, another was undertaken. It seemed to her, therefore, that the punishment of Serbia would make up for other failures, and moreover would enable her to assist Turkey, which needed munitions, besides releasing for Germany supplies of food and other material which might come from Turkey. They therefore entrusted an expedition against Serbia to Field Marshal von Mackensen, and had begun to gather an army for that purpose, north of the Danube.  This army of course was mainly composed of Austrian troops, but was stiffened throughout by some of the best regiments from the German army. To assist this new army they counted upon Bulgaria, with whom they had already a secret treaty, and in spite of the falsehoods issued from Sofia, the Bulgarian mobilization was meant for an attack on Serbia. The condition of affairs was well understood in Russia.  On October 2, 1915, M. Sazonov, Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, issued the following statement: \"The situation in the Balkans is very grave. The whole Russian nation is aroused by the unthinkable treachery of Ferdinand and his Government to the Slavic cause. Bulgaria owes her independence to Russia, and yet seems willing now to become a vassal of Russia\\'s enemies. In her attitude towards Serbia, when Serbia is fighting for her very existence, Bulgaria puts herself in the class with Turkey. We do not believe that the Bulgarian people sympathize with the action of their ruler therefore, the Allies are disposed to give them time for reflection. If they persist in their present treacherous course they must answer to Russia.\" The next day the following ultimatum from Russia was handed the Bulgarian Prime Minister:   Events which are taking place in Bulgaria at this moment give evidence of the definite decision of King Ferdinand\\'s Government to place the fate of its country in the hands of Germany. The presence of German and Austrian officers at the Ministry of War and on the staffs of the army, the concentration of troops in the zone bordering on Serbia, and the extensive financial support accepted from her enemies by the Sofia Cabinet, no longer leave any doubt as to the object of the present military preparations of Bulgaria. The powers of the Entente, who have at heart the realization of the      aspirations of the Bulgarian people, have on many occasions warned M. Radoslavoff that any hostile act against Serbia would be considered as directed against themselves. The assurances given by the head of the Bulgarian Cabinet in reply to these warnings are      contradicted by facts. The representative of Russia, bound to Bulgaria by the imperishable memory of her liberation from the Turkish yoke, cannot sanction by his presence preparations for fratricidal aggression against a Slav and allied people. The Russian Minister has, therefore, received orders to leave Bulgaria with all the staffs of the Legation and the Consulates if the Bulgarian Government does not within twenty-four hours openly break with the enemies of the Slav cause and of Russia, and does not at once proceed to send away the officers belonging to the armies of states who are at war with the powers of the Entente.   Similar ultimatums were presented by representatives of France and Great Britain. Bulgaria\\'s reply to these ultimatums was described as bold to the verge of insolence. In substance she denied that German officers were on the staffs of Bulgarian armies, but said that if they were present that fact concerned only Bulgaria, which reserved the right to invite whomsoever she liked. The Bulgarian Government then issued a manifesto to the nation, announcing its decision to enter the war on the side of the Central Powers. The manifesto reads as follows:   The Central Powers have promised us parts of Serbia, creating an Austro-Hungarian border line, which is absolutely necessary for Bulgaria\\'s independence of the Serbians. We do not believe in the promises of the Quadruple Entente. Italy, one of the Allies, treacherously broke her treaty of thirty-three years. We believe in Germany, which is fighting the whole world to fulfill her treaty with Austria. Bulgaria must fight at the victor\\'s side. The Germans and Austro-Hungarians are victorious on all fronts. Russia soon will have collapsed entirely. Then will come the turn of France, Italy and Serbia. Bulgaria would commit suicide if she did not fight on the side of the Central Powers, which offer the only possibility of realizing her desire for a union of all Bulgarian peoples.   The manifesto also stated that Russia was fighting for Constantinople and the Dardanelles; Great Britain to destroy Germany\\'s competition; France for Alsace and Lorraine, and the other allies to rob foreign countries; the Central Powers were declared to be fighting to defend property and assure peaceful progress. The manifesto filled seven columns in the newspapers, and discussed at some length Bulgaria\\'s trade interests. It attacked Serbia most bitterly, declaring that Serbia had oppressed the Bulgarian population of Macedonia in a most barbarous manner; that she had attacked Bulgarian territory and that the Bulgarian troops had been forced to fight for the defense of their own soil. In fact it was written in quite the usual German manner.  Long before this M. Venizelos, the Greek Premier, had perceived what was coming. Greece was bound by treaty to assist Serbia if she were attacked by Bulgaria. On September 21st, Venizelos asked France and Britain for a hundred and fifty thousand troops. On the 24th, the Allies agreed to this and Greece at once began to mobilize. His policy was received with great enthusiasm in the Greek Chamber, and former Premier Gounaris, amid applause, expressed his support of the government.  On October 6th an announcement from Athens stated that Premier Venizelos had resigned, the King having informed him that he was unable to support the policy of his Minister. King Constantine was a brother-in-law of the German Emperor, and although professing neutrality he had steadily opposed M. Venizelos\\' policy. He had once before forced M. Venizelos\\' resignation, but at the general elections which followed, the Greek statesman was returned to power by a decisive majority.  Intense indignation was caused by the King\\'s action, though the King was able to procure the support of a considerable party. Venizelos\\' resignation was precipitated by the landing of the Allied troops in Saloniki. They had come at the invitation of Venizelos, but the opposition protested against the occupation of Greek territory by foreign troops. After a disorderly session in which Venizelos explained to the Chamber of Deputies the circumstances connected with the landing, the Chamber passed a vote of confidence in the Government by 142 to 102. The substance of his argument may be found in his conclusion:   \"We have a treaty with Serbia. If we are honest we will leave nothing undone to insure its fulfillment in letter and spirit. Only if we are rogues may we find excuses to avoid our obligations.\"   [Illustration: Map]   TWELVE MILES EAST OF MONASTIR BEGAN THE GREAT ALLIED   OFFENSIVE THAT DEFEATED BULGARIA IN SEPTEMBER, 1918   Upon his first resignation M. Zaimis was appointed Premier, and declared for a policy of armed neutrality. This position was sharply criticised by Venizelos, but for a time became the policy of the Greek Government. Meantime the Allied troops were arriving at Saloniki. On October 3d, seventy thousand French troops arrived. A formal protest was made by the Greek commandant, who then directed the harbor officials to assist in arranging the landing. In a short time the Allied forces amounted to a hundred and fifty thousand men, but the German campaign was moving rapidly.  The German Balkan army captured Belgrade on the 9th of October, and by that date two Bulgarian armies were on the Serbian frontier. Serbia found herself opposed by two hundred thousand Austro-Germans and a quarter of a million Bulgarians. Greece and Roumania fully mobilized and were watching the conflict, and the small allied contingent at Saloniki was preparing to march inland to the aid of Serbia.  The conduct of Greece on this occasion has led to universal criticism. The King himself, no doubt, was mainly moved by his German wife and the influence of his Imperial brother-in-law. Those that were associated with him were probably moved by fear. They had been much impressed by the strength of the German armies. They had seen the success of the great German offensive in Russia, while the French and British were being held in the West. They knew, too, the strength of Bulgaria. The national characteristic of the Greeks is prudence, and it cannot be denied that there was great reason to suppose that the armies of Greece would not be able to resist the new attack. With these views Venizelos, the greatest statesman that Greece had produced for many years, did not agree, and the election seemed to show that he was supported by the majority of the Greek people.  This was another case where the Allies, faced by a dangerous situation, were acting with too great caution. In Gallipoli they had failed, because at the very beginning they had not used their full strength. Now, again, knowing as they did all that depended upon it, bound as they were to the most loyal support of Serbia, the aid they sent was too small to be more than a drop in the bucket. It must be remembered, however, that the greatest leaders among the Allies were at all times opposed to in any way scattering their strength. They believed that the war was to be won in France. Military leaders in particular yielded under protest to the political leaders when expeditions of this character were undertaken.  Certainly this is true, that the world believed that Serbia had a right to Allied assistance. The gallant little nation was fighting for her life, and public honor demanded that she should be aided. It was this strong feeling that led to the action that was taken, in spite of the military opinions. It was, however, too late.  In the second week of October Serbia found herself faced by an enemy which was attacking her on three sides. She herself had been greatly weakened. Her losses in 1914, when she had driven Austria from her border, must have been at least two hundred thousand men. She had suffered from pestilence and famine. Her strength now could not have been more than two hundred thousand, and though she was fairly well supplied with munitions, she was so much outnumbered that she could hardly hope for success. On her west she was facing the Austro-German armies; on her east Bulgaria; on the south Albania. Her source of supplies was Saloniki and this was really her only hope. If the Allies at Saloniki could stop the Bulgarian movement, the Serbians might face again the Austro-Germans. They expected this help from the Allies.  At Nish the town was decorated and the school children waited outside the station with bouquets to present to the coming reinforcements. But the Allies did not come.  Von Mackensen\\'s plan was simple enough. His object was to win a way to Constantinople. This could be done either by the control of the Danube or the Ottoman Railroad. To control the Danube he had to seize northeastern Serbia for the length of the river. This was comparatively easy and would give him a clear water way to the Bulgarian railways connected with Constantinople. The Ottoman railway was a harder route to win. It meant an advance to the southeast, which would clear the Moravo valley up to Nish, and then the Nishava valley up to Bulgaria. The movements involved were somewhat complex, but easily carried out on account of the very great numerical superiority of von Mackensen\\'s forces.  On September 19th Belgrade was bombarded. The Serbian positions were gradually destroyed. On the 7th of October the German armies crossed the Danube, and on the 8th the Serbians began to retreat. There was great destruction in Belgrade and the Bulgarian General, Mishitch, was forced slowly back to the foothills of the Tser range.  For a time von Mackensen moved slowly. He did not wish to drive the Serbians too far south. On the 12th of October the Bulgarian army began its attack. At first it was held, but by October 17th was pushing forward all along the line. On the 20th they entered Uskub, a central point of all the routes of southern Serbia. This practically separated the Allied forces at Saloniki from the Serbian armies further north. Disaster followed disaster. On Tuesday, October 26th, a junction of Bulgarian and Austro-German patrols was completed in the Dobravodo mountains. General von Gallwitz announced that a moment of world significance had come, that the \"Orient and Occident had been united, and on the basis of this firm and indissoluble union a new and mighty vierbund comes into being, created by the victory of our arms.\"   [Illustration: Map: Proposed railroad through Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Balkans, Turkey, to Bagdad and the Persian Gulf.]  GERMANY\\'S DREAM: \"THE BREMEN-BERLIN-BOSPORUS-BAGDAD-BAHN\"   The road from Germany, through Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria to Turkey lay open. On October 31st, Milanovac was lost, and on November 2nd, Kraguyevac surrendered, the decisive battle of the war. On November 7th, Nish was captured. General Jecoff announced: \"After fierce and sanguinary fighting the fortress of Nish has been conquered by our brave victorious troops and the Bulgarian flag has been hoisted to remain forever.\"  The Serbian army continued steadily to retreat, until on November 8th, advancing Franco-British troops almost joined with them, presenting a line from Prilep to Dorolovo on the Bulgarian frontier. At this time the Bulgarian army suffered a defeat at Izvor, and also at Strumitza. The Allied armies were now reported to number three hundred thousand men. The Austro-Germans by this time had reached the mountainous region of Serbia, and were meeting with strong resistance.  On November 13th, German despatches from the front claimed the capture of 54,000 Serbian prisoners. The aged King Peter of Serbia was in full flight, followed by the Crown Prince. The Serbians, however, were still fighting and on November 15th, made a stand on the western bank of the Morava River, and recaptured the town of Tatova.  At this time the Allied world was watching the Serbian struggle with interest and sympathy. In the House of Lords, Lord Lansdowne in a discussion of the English effort to give them aid said: \"It is impossible to think or speak of Serbia without a tribute to the wondrous gallantry with which that little country withstood two separate invasions, and has lately been struggling against a third. She repelled the first two invasions by an effort which I venture to think formed one of the most glorious chapters in the history of this Great War.\"  Serbia, however, was compelled once more to retreat, and their retreat soon became a rout. Their guns were abandoned and the roads were strewn with fainting, starving men. The sufferings of the Serbian people during this time are indescribable. Men, women, and children struggled along in the wake of the armies without food or shelter. King Peter himself was able to escape, with the greatest difficulty. By traveling on horseback and mule back in disguise he finally reached Scutari and crossed to Brindisi and finally arrived at Saloniki on New Year\\'s Day, crippled and almost blind, but still full of fight.  \"I believe,\" he said, \"in the liberty of Serbia, as I believe in God. It was the dream of my youth. It was for that I fought throughout manhood. It has become the faith of the twilight of my life, I live only to see Serbia free. I pray that God may let me live until the day of redemption of my people. On that day I am ready to die, if the Lord wills. I have struggled a great deal in my life, and am tired, bruised and broken from it, but I will see, I shall see, this triumph. I shall not die before the victory of my country.\"  The Serbian army had been driven out of Serbia. But the Allies who had come up from Saloniki were still unbeaten. On October 12th, the French General Serrail arrived and moved with the French forces, as has already been said, to the Serbian aid. They met with a number of successes. On October 19th they seized the Bulgarian town of Struminitza, and occupied strong positions on the left bank of the Vardar. On October 27th they occupied Krivolak, with the British Tenth Division, which had joined them on their right. They then occupied the summit of Karahodjali, which commanded the whole section of the valley. This the Bulgarians attacked in force on the 5th of November, but were badly repulsed. They then attempted to move toward Babuna Pass, twenty-five miles west of Krivolak, where they hoped to join hands with the Serbian column at that point.  They were being faced by a Bulgarian army numbering one hundred and twenty-five thousand men, and found themselves in serious danger. They were compelled to fall back into what is called the \"Entrenched Camp of Kavodar\" without bringing the aid to the Serbian army that they had hoped. The Allied expedition to aid Serbia had failed. It was hopeless from the start, and, if anything, had injured Serbia by raising false expectations which had interfered with their plans.  During the whole of this disastrous campaign a desperate political struggle was going on in Greece. On November 3rd, the Zaimis Cabinet tendered its resignation to King Constantine. The trouble was over a bill for extra pay to army officers, but it led to an elaborate discussion of the Greek war policy. M. Venizelos made two long speeches defending his policy, and condemning the policy of his opponents in regard to the Balkan situation. He said that he deplored the fact that Serbia was being left to be crushed by Bulgaria, Greece\\'s hereditary enemy, who would not scruple later to fall on Greece herself. He spoke of the King in a friendly way, criticizing, however, his position. He had been twice removed from the Premiership, although he had a majority behind him in the Greek Chamber.  \"Our State,\" he said, \"is a democracy, presided over by the King, and the whole responsibility rests with the Cabinet. I admit that the Crown has a right to disagree with the responsible Government if he thinks the latter is not in agreement with the national will. But after the recent election, non-agreement is out of the question, and now the Crown has not the right to disagree again on the same question. It is not a question of patriotism but of constitutional liberty.\"  When the vote was taken the Government was defeated by 147 to 114. Instead of appointing Venizelos Premier, King Constantine gave the position to M. Skouloudis, and then dissolved the Greek Chamber by royal decree. Premier Skouloudis declared his policy to be neutrality with the character of sincerest benevolence toward the Entente Powers. The general conditions at Athens during this whole time were causing great anxiety in the Allied capitals, and the Allied expedition were in continual fear of an attack in the rear in case of reverse. They endeavored to obtain satisfactory assurances on this point, and while assurances were given, during the whole period of King Constantine\\'s reign aggressive action was prevented because of the doubt as to what course King Constantine would take.  It was not till August 27th, 1916, that Roumania cast aside her role of neutral and entered the war with a declaration of hostilities on Austria-Hungary. Great expectations were founded upon the supposedly well-trained Roumanian army and upon the nation which, because of its alertness and discipline, was known as \"the policeman of Europe.\" The belief was general in Paris and London that the weight of men and material thrown into the scale by Roumania would bring the to a speedy, victorious end.  Germany, however, was confident. A spy system excelling in its detailed reports anything that had heretofore been attempted, made smooth the path of the German army. Scarcely had the Roumanian army launched a drive in force into Transylvania on August 30th, when the message spread from Bucharest \"von Mackensen is coming. Recall the army. Draft all males of military age. Prepare for the worst.\"  And the worst fell upon hapless Roumania. A vast force of military engineers moving like a human screen in front of von Mackensen\\'s array, followed routes carefully mapped out by German spies during the period of Roumanians neutrality. Military bridges, measured to the inch, had been prepared to carry cannon, material and men over streams and ravines. Every Roumanian oil well, mine and storehouse had been located and mapped. German scientists had studied Roumanian weather conditions and von Mackensen attacked while the roads were at their best and the weather most favorable. As the Germans swept forward, spies met them giving them military information of the utmost value. A swarm of airplanes spied out the movements of the Roumanians and no Roumanian airplanes rose to meet them.

[Illustration: Photograph]   BAGDAD THE MAGNIFICENT FALLS TO THE BRITISH   General Maude is here shown making his formal entry at the head of his   troops into the ancient city. This occurred on March 11, 1917, and was   the most notable exploit of General Maude, commander of the British   Mesopotamian expedition until his death by cholera nine months   afterwards.   General von Falkenhayn, co-operating with von Mackensen, smashed his way through Vulkan Pass, and cut the main line running to Bucharest at Craiova. The Dobrudja region was over-run and the central Roumanian plain was swept clear of all Roumanian opposition to the German advance. The seat of government transferred from Bucharest to Jassy on November 28, 1916, and on December 6th Bucharest was entered by von Mackensen, definitely putting an end to Roumania as a factor in the war.  The result of the fall of Roumania was to release immense stores of petroleum for German use. British and Roumanian engineers had done their utmost by the use of explosives to make useless the great Roumanian oil wells, but German engineers soon had the precious fluid in full flow. This furnished the fuel which Germany had long and ardently desired. The oil-burning submarine now came into its own. It was possible to plan a great fleet of submersibles to attempt execution of von Tirpitz\\'s plan for unrestricted submarine warfare. This was decided upon by the German High Command, the day Bucharest fell. It was realized that such a policy would bring the United States into the war, but the Kaiser and his advisers hoped the submarine on sea and a great western front offensive on land would force a decision in favor of Germany before America could get ready. How that hope failed was revealed at Chateau-Thierry and in the humiliation of Germany.    CHAPTER VII  THE CAMPAIGN IN MESOPOTAMIA  In our previous discussion of the British campaign in Mesopotamia we left the British forces intrenched at Kurna, and also occupying Basra, the port of Bagdad. The object of the Mesopotamia Expedition was primarily to keep the enemy from the shores of the Gulf of Persia. If the English had been satisfied with that, the misfortune which was to come to them might never have occurred, but the whole expedition was essentially political rather than military in its nature.  The British were defending India. The Germans, unable to attack the British Empire by sea, were hoping to attack her by land. They had already attempted to stir up a Holy War with the full expectation that it would lead to an Indian revolution. In this they had failed, for the millions of Mohammedans in India cared little for the Turkish Sultan or his proclamations. Through Bagdad, however, they hoped to strike a blow at the English influence on the Persian Gulf. The English, therefore, felt strongly that it was not enough to sit safely astride the Tigris, but that a blow at Bagdad would produce a tremendous political effect. It would practically prevent German communication with Persia, and the Indian frontier.  As a matter of fact the Persian Gulf and the oil fields were safe so long as the English held Kurna and Basra, and the Arabs were of no special consequence. The real reason for the expedition was probably that about this time matters were moving badly for the Allies. Serbia was in trouble in the Balkans, Gallipoli was a failure, something it seemed ought to be done to restore the British prestige. Up to this time the Mesopotamia Expedition had been a great success, but it had made no great impression on the world. The little villages in the hands of the British had unknown names, but if Bagdad should be captured Great Britain would have something to boast of; something would keep up its prestige among its Mohammedan subjects.  Before the expedition to Bagdad was determined on, there had been several lively fights between the English forces and the Turks. On March 3d a Turkish force numbering about twelve thousand appeared at Ahwaz where the British had placed a small garrison to protect the pipe line of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The British retirement led to heavy fighting, with severe losses.  A number of lively skirmishes followed, and then the serious attack against Shaiba. The Turkish army numbered about eighteen thousand men, of whom eleven thousand were regulars. The fighting lasted for several days, the Turks being reinforced. On the 14th of April, however, the English attacked in turn and put the whole enemy force to flight. The British lost about seven hundred officers and men, reported a Turkish loss of about six thousand. In their retreat the Turks were attacked by their Arab allies, and suffered additional losses. From that time till summer there were no serious contests, although there were occasional skirmishes which turned out favorably to the British.  By this time the Turks had collected a considerable army north of Kurna, and on May 31st an expedition was made to disperse it. On June 3d the British captured Amara, seventy-five miles above Kurna, scattering the Turkish army. Early in July a similar expedition was sent against Nasiriyeh, which led to serious fighting, the Turks being badly defeated with a loss of over two thousand five hundred men.  Kut-el-Amara still remained, and early in August an expedition was directed against that point. The Turks were found in great force, well intrenched, and directed by German officers. The battle lasted for four days. The English suffered great hardship on account of the scarcity of water and the blinding heat, but on September 29th they drove the enemy from the city and took possession. More than two thousand prisoners were taken. The town was found thoroughly fortified, with an elaborate system of trenches extending for miles, built in the true German fashion. Its capture was the end of the summer campaign.  The British now had at last made up their minds to push on to Bagdad. General Townshend, whose work so far had been admirable, protested, but Sir John Nixon, and the Indian military authorities, were strongly in favor of the expedition. By October, Turkey was able to gather a large army. She was fighting in Transcaucasia, Egypt, Gallipoli and Mesopotamia. Little was going on in the first three of these fronts, and she was able therefore to send to Mesopotamia almost a quarter of a million men.   [Illustration: Map: Bagdad in the Northwest corner, Basra in the Southeast corner.]   THE MESOPOTAMIAN SECTOR, WHERE THE BRITISH ROUTED THE TURKISH ARMY   Kut-el-Amara first besieged and captured by the Turks, was retaken by   General Maude on February 26,1917; Bagdad the Magnificent felt on   March 11th. It was here that General Maude, the hero of Mesopotamia,   died on November 18, 1917.   To meet these, General Townshend had barely fifteen thousand men, of whom only one-third were white soldiers.  He was backed by a flotilla of boats of almost every kind,--river boats, motor launches, paddle steamers, native punts. The British army was almost worn out by the fighting during the intense heat of the previous summer. But their success had given them confidence.  In the early days of October the advance began. For some days it proceeded with no serious fighting. On the 23d of October it reached Azizie, and was halted by a Turkish force numbering about four thousand. These were soon routed, and the advance continued until General Townshend arrived at Lajj, about seven miles from Ctesiphon, where the Turks were found heavily intrenched and in great numbers. Ctesiphon was a famous old city which had been the battle ground of Romans and Parthians, but was now mainly ruins. In these ruins, however, the Turks found admirable shelter for nests of machine guns. On the 21st of November General Townshend made his attack.  [Illustration: Map]   Map of Gen. Townshend\\'s Lines of Attack on Kut-El-Amara  The Turks occupied two lines of intrenchments, and had about twenty thousand men, the English about twelve thousand. General Townshend\\'s plan was to divide his army into three columns. The first was to attack the center of the first Turkish position. A second was directed at the left of that position, and a third was to swing widely around and come in on the rear of the Turkish force. This plan was entirely successful, but the Turkish army was not routed, and retreated fighting desperately to its second line. There it was reinforced and counter-attacked with such vigor that it drove the British back to its old first trenches. The next day the Turks were further reinforced and attacked again. The British drove them back over and over, but found themselves unable to advance. The Turks had lost enormously but the English had lost about one-third of their strength, and were compelled to fall back. They therefore returned on the 26th to Lajj, and ultimately, after continual rear guard actions, to Kut. There they found themselves surrounded, and there was nothing to do but to wait for help.  By this time the eyes of the world were upon the beleaguered British army. Help was being hurried to them from India, but Germany also was awake and Marshal von Der Goltz, who had been military instructor in the Turkish army, was sent down to take command of the Turkish forces. The town of Kut lies in the loop of the Tigris, making it almost an island. There was an intrenched line across the neck of land on the north, and the place could resist any ordinary assault. The great difficulty was one of supplies. However, as the relieving force was on the way, no great anxiety was felt. For some days there was constant bombardment, which did no great damage. On the 23d an attempt was made to carry the place by assault, but this too failed. The relieving force, however, was having its troubles. These were the days of floods, and progress was slow and at times almost impossible. Moreover, the Turks were constantly resisting.  The relief expedition was composed of thirty thousand Indian troops, two Anglo-Indian divisions, and the remnants of Townshend\\'s expedition, a total of about ninety thousand men. General Sir Percy Lake was in command of the entire force. The march began on January 6th. By January 8th the British had reached Sheikh Saad, where the Turks were defeated in two pitched battles. On January 22d he had arrived at Umm-el-Hanna, where the Turks had intrenched themselves.  After artillery bombardment the Turkish positions were attacked, but heavy rains had converted the ground into a sea of mud, rendering rapid movement impossible. The enemy\\'s fire was heavy and effective, inflicting severe losses, and though every effort was made, the assault failed.  For weeks the British troops bivouacked in driving rain on soaked and sodden ground. Three times they were called upon to advance over a perfectly flat country, deep in mud, and absolutely devoid of cover against well-constructed and well-planned trenches, manned by a brave and stubborn enemy, approximately their equal in numbers. They showed a spirit of endurance and self-sacrifice of which their country may well be proud.  But the repulse at Hanna did not discourage the British army. It was decided to move up the left bank of the Tigris and attack the Turkish position at the Dujailah redoubt. This meant a night march across the desert with great danger that there would be no water supply and that, unless the enemy was routed, the army would be in great danger.  General Lake says: \"On the afternoon of March 7th, General Aylmer assembled his subordinate commanders and gave his final instructions, laying particular stress on the fact that the operation was designed to effect a surprise, and that to prevent the enemy forestalling us, it was essential that the first phase of the operation should be pushed through with the utmost vigor. His dispositions were, briefly, as follows: The greater part of a division under General Younghusband, assisted by naval gunboats, controlled the enemy on the left bank. The remaining troops were formed into two columns, under General Kemball and General Keary respectively, a reserve of infantry, and the cavalry brigade, being held at the Corps Commander\\'s own disposal. Kemball\\'s column covered on the outer flank by the cavalry brigade was to make a turning movement to attack the Dujailah redoubt from the south, supported by the remainder of the force, operating from a position to the east of the redoubt. The night march by this large force, which led across the enemy\\'s front to a position on his right flank, was a difficult operation, entailing movement over unknown ground, and requiring most careful arrangement to attain success.\"  Thanks to excellent staff work and good march discipline the troops reached their allotted position apparently undiscovered by the enemy, but while Keary\\'s column was in position at daybreak, ready to support Kemball\\'s attack, the latter\\'s command did not reach the point selected for its deployment in the Dujailah depression until more than an hour later. This delay was highly prejudicial to the success of the operation.  When, nearly three hours later, Kemball\\'s troops advanced to the attack, they were strongly opposed by the enemy from trenches cleverly concealed in the brushwood, and were unable to make further ground for some time, though assisted by Keary\\'s attack upon the redoubt from the east. The southern attack was now reinforced, and by 1 P.M. had pushed forward to within five hundred yards of the redoubt, but concealed trenches again stopped further progress and the Turks made several counter-attacks with reinforcements which had by now arrived from the direction of Magasis.  It was about this time that the Corps Commander received from his engineer officers the unwelcome news that the water supply contained in rain-water pools and in Dujailah depression, upon which he had reckoned, was insufficient and could not be increased by digging. It was clear, therefore, that unless the Dujailah redoubt could be carried that day the scarcity of water would, of itself, compel the troops to fall back. Preparations were accordingly made for a further assault on the redoubt, and attacks were launched from the south and east under cover of a heavy bombardment.  The attacking forces succeeded in gaining a foothold in the redoubt. But here they were heavily counter-attacked by large enemy reinforcements, and being subjected to an extremely rapid and accurate shrapnel fire from concealed guns in the vicinity of Sinn After, they were forced to fall back to the position from which they started. The troops who had been under arms for some thirty hours, including a long night march, were now much exhausted, and General Aylmer considered that a renewal of the assault during the night could not be made with any prospect of success. Next morning the enemy\\'s position was found to be unchanged and General Aylmer, finding himself faced with the deficiency of order already referred to, decided upon the immediate withdrawal of his troops to Wadi, which was reached the same night.  For the next month the English were held in their positions by the Tigris floods. On April 4th the floods had sufficiently receded to permit of another attack upon Umm-el-Hanna, which this time was successful. On April 8th the Turkish position at Sanna-i-yat was attacked, but the English were repulsed. They then determined to make another attempt to capture the Sinn After redoubt. On April 17th the fort of Beit-Aiessa, four miles from Es Sinn, on the left bank, was captured after heavy bombardment, and held against serious counter-attacks. On the 20th and 21st the Sanna-i-yat position was bombarded and a vigorous assault was made, which met with some success. The Turks, however, delivered a strong counter-attack, and succeeded in forcing the British troops back.  General Lake says: \"Persistent and repeated attempts on both banks have thus failed, and it was known that at the outside not more than six days\\' supplies remained to the Kut garrison. The British troops were nearly worn out. The same troops had advanced time and again to assault positions strong by art and held by a determined enemy. For eighteen consecutive days they had done all that men could do to overcome, not only the enemy, but also exceptional climatic and physical obstacles, and this on a scale of rations which was far from being sufficient in view of the exertions they had undergone but which the shortage of river transports, had made it impossible to augment. The need for rest was imperative.\"  On April 28th the British garrison at Kut-el-Amara surrendered unconditionally, after a heroic resistance of a hundred and forty-three days. According to British figures the surrendered army was composed of 2,970 English and 6,000 Indian troops. The Turkish figures are 13,300. The Turks also captured a large amount of booty, although General Townshend destroyed most of his guns and munitions.  During the period in which Kut-el-Amara was besieged by the Turks, the British troops had suffered much. The enemy bombarded the town almost every day, but did little damage. The real foe was starvation. At first the British were confident that a relief expedition would soon reach them, and they amused themselves by cricket and hockey and fishing in the river. By early February, however, it was found necessary to reduce the rations, and a month later they were suffering from hunger. Some little help was given them by airplanes, which brought tobacco and some small quantities of supplies. Soon the horses and the mules were slaughtered and eaten. As time went on the situation grew desperate; till almost the end, however, they did not lose hope. Through the wireless they were informed about the progress of the relief expeditions and had even heard their guns in the distance. They gradually grew, however, weaker and weaker, so that on the surrender the troops in the first lines were too weak to march back with their kits.  The Turks treated the prisoners in a chivalric manner; food and tobacco was at once distributed, and all were interned in Anatolia, except General Townshend and his staff, who were taken to Constantinople. Later on it was General Townshend who was to have the honor of carrying the Turkish plea for an armistice in the closing days of the war.  The surrender of Kut created a world-wide sensation. The loss of eight thousand troops was, of course, not a serious matter, and the road to India was still barred, but the moral effect was most unfortunate. That the great British nation, whose power had been so respected in the Orient, should now be forced to yield, was a great blow to its prestige. In England, of course, there was a flood of criticism. It was very plain that a mistake had been made. A commission was appointed to inquire into the whole business. This committee reported to Parliament on June 26, 1917, and the report created a great sensation. The substance of the report was, that while the expedition was justifiable from a political point of view, it was undertaken with insufficient forces and inadequate preparation, and it sharply criticized those that were responsible.  It seems plain that the military authorities in India under-estimated their opponent. The report especially criticized General Sir John Eccles Nixon, the former commander of the British forces in Mesopotamia, who had urged the expedition, in spite of the objection of General Townshend. Others sharing the blame were the Viceroy of India, Baron Hardinge, General Sir Beauchamp Duff, Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in India, and, in England, Major-General Sir Edmund Barrow, Military Secretary of the India office, J. Austen Chamberlain, Secretary for India, and the War Committee of the Cabinet. According to the report, beside the losses incurred by the surrender more than twenty-three thousand men were lost in the relieving expedition. The general armament and equipment were declared to be not only insufficient, but not up to the standard.  In consequence of this report Mr. Chamberlain resigned as secretary for India. In the House of Commons, Mr. Balfour, Secretary of Foreign Affairs, supported Lord Hardinge, who, at the time of the report, was Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs. He declared the criticism of Baron Hardinge to be grossly unjust. After some discussion the House of Commons supported Mr. Balfour\\'s refusal to accept Baron Hardinge\\'s resignation, by a vote of 176 to 81. It seems to be agreed that the civil administration of India were not responsible for the blunders of the expedition. Ten years before, Lord Kitchener, after a bitter controversy with Lord Curzon, had made the military side of the Indian Government free of all civilian criticism and control. The blunders here were military blunders.  The English, of course, were not satisfied to leave the situation in such a condition, and at once began their plans for a new attempt to capture Bagdad. The summer campaign, however, was uneventful, though on May 18th a band of Cossacks from the Russian armies in Persia joined the British camp. A few days afterwards the British army went up the Tigris and captured the Dujailah redoubt, where they had been so badly defeated on the 8th of March. They then approached close to Kut, but the weather was unsuitable, and there was now no object in capturing the city.  In August Sir Percy Lake was succeeded by Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick Stanley Maude, who carefully and thoroughly proceeded to prepare for an expedition which should capture Bagdad. A dispatch from General Maude dated July 10, 1917, gives a full account of this expedition. It was thoroughly successful. This time with a sufficient army and a thorough equipment the British found no difficulties, and on February 26th they captured Kut-el-Amara, not after a hard-fought battle, but as the result of a successful series of small engagements. The Turks kept up a steady resistance, but the British blood was up. They were remembering General Townshend\\'s surrender, and the Turks were driven before them in great confusion.  The capture of Kut, however, was not an object in itself, and the British pushed steadily on up the Tigris. The Turks occasionally made a stand, but without effect. On the 28th of February the English had arrived at Azizie, half way to Bagdad, where a halt was made. On the 5th of March the advance was renewed. The Ctesiphon position, which had defied General Townshend, was found to be strongly intrenched, but empty. On March 7th the enemy made a stand on the River Diala, which enters the Tigris eight miles below Bagdad. Some lively fighting followed, the enemy resisting four attempts to cross the Diala. However, on March 10th the British forces crossed, and were now close to Bagdad. The enemy suddenly retired and the British troops found that their main opponent was a dust storm. The enemy retired beyond Bagdad, and on March 11th the city was occupied by the English.  The fall of Bagdad was an important event. It cheered the Allies, and proved, especially to the Oriental world, the power of the British army. Those who originally planned its capture had been right, but those who were to carry out the plan had not done their duty. Under General Maude it was a comparatively simple operation, though full of admirable details, and it produced all the good effects expected. The British, of course, did not stop at Bagdad. The city itself is not of strategic importance. The surrounding towns were occupied and an endeavor was made to conciliate the inhabitants. The real object of the expedition was attained.    CHAPTER XXV  CANADA\\'S PART IN THE GREAT WAR  By COL. GEO. G. NASMITH, C. M. G., TORONTO  When, in August,1914, war burst suddenly upon a peaceful world like distant thunder in a cloudless summer sky, Canada, like the rest of the British Empire, was profoundly startled. She had been a peace-loving, non-military nation, satisfied to develop her great natural resources, and live in harmony with her neighbors; taking little interest in European affairs, Canadians, in fact, were a typical colonial people, with little knowledge even of the strength of the ties that linked them to the British Empire.  Upon declaration of war by Great Britain Canada immediately sprang to arms. The love of country and empire which had been no obvious thing burst forth in a patriotic fervor as deep as it was spontaneous and genuine. The call to action was answered with an enthusiasm the like of which had rarely, if ever, been seen in any British colony.  The Canadian Government called for 20,000 volunteers--enough for a single division--as Canada\\'s contribution to the British army. In less than a month 40,000 men had volunteered, and the Minister of Militia was compelled to stop the further enrolment of recruits. From the gold fields of the Yukon, from the slopes of the Rockies on the west to the surf-beaten shores of the Atlantic on the east; from workshop and mine; from farm, office and forest, Canada\\'s sons trooped to the colors.  It will be the everlasting glory of the men of the first Canadian contingent, that they needed no spur, either of victory or defeat: they volunteered because they were quick to perceive that the existence of their Empire was threatened by the action of the most formidable nation-in-arms that the world had ever seen. They had been stirred by the deepest emotion of a race--the love of country.  A site for a concentration camp was chosen at Valcartier, nestling among the blue Laurentian hills, sixteen miles from Quebec, and convenient to that point of embarkation. Within four days 6,000 men had arrived at Valcartier; in another week there were 25,000 men. From centers all over Canada troop trains, each carrying hundreds of embryo soldiers, sped towards Valcartier and deposited their burdens on the miles of sidings that had sprung up as though by magic.  The rapid evolution of that wild and wooded river valley into a model military camp was a great tribute to the engineering skill and energy of civilians who had never done the like before. One day an army of woodmen were seen felling trees; the next day the stumps were torn out and the hollows filled; on the third day long rows of tents in regular camp formation covered the ground, and on the fourth day they were occupied by civilian soldiers concentrated upon learning the rudiments of the art and science of war.  Streets were laid out; miles of water pipes, sunk in machine-made ditches, were connected to hundreds of taps and shower baths; electric light was installed; three miles of rifle butts completed, and in two weeks the camp was practically finished--the finest camp that the first Canadians were destined to see. The building of Valcartier camp was characteristic of the driving power, vision and genius of the Minister of Militia, General Sir Sam Hughes.  Of the 33,000 men assembled at Valcartier, the great majority were civilians without any previous training in warfare. About 7,000 Canadians had taken part in the South African war, fifteen years before, and some of these, together with a few ex-regulars who had seen active service, were formed into the Princess Patricia\\'s Light Infantry. Otherwise, with the exception of the 3,000 regulars that formed the standing army of Canada, the men and most of the officers were amateurs.  It was therefore a feat that the Canadian people could well afford to be proud of, that in the great crisis they were able, through their aggressive Minister of Militia, not only to gather up these forces so quickly but that they willingly and without delay converted their industries to the manufacture of all necessary army equipment. Factories all over the country immediately began turning out vast quantities of khaki cloth, uniforms, boots, ammunition, harness, wagons, and the thousand and one articles necessary for an army.  Before the end of September, 1914, the Canadian Expeditionary Force had been roughly hewn into shape, battalions had been regrouped and remodeled, officers transferred and re-transferred, intensive training carried on, and all the necessary equipment assembled. On October 3, 1914, thirty-three Atlantic liners, carrying the contingent of 33,000 men, comprising infantry, artillery, cavalry, engineers, signalers, medical corps, army service supply and ammunition columns, together with horses, guns, ammunition, wagons, motor lorries and other essentials, sailed from Gaspe basin on the Quebec seaboard to the battle-field of Europe.  It was probably the largest convoy that had ever been gathered together. This modern armada in three long lines, each line one and one-half miles apart, led by cruisers and with battleships on the front, rear and either flank, presented a thrilling spectacle. The voyage proved uneventful, and on October 14th, the convoy steamed into Plymouth, receiving an extraordinary ovation by the sober English people, who seemed temporarily to have gone wild with enthusiasm. Back of that demonstration was the conviction that blood had proved thicker than water and that the apparently flimsy ties that bound the colonies to the empire were bonds that were unbreakable. The German conviction that the British colonies would fall away and the British Empire disintegrate upon the outbreak of a great war had proved fallacious. It was, moreover, a great demonstration of how the much-vaunted German navy had already been swept from the seas and rendered impotent by the might of Britain\\'s fleet.  A few days later the Canadians had settled down on Salisbury Plain in southern England for the further course of training necessary before proceeding to France. There, for nearly four months in the cold and the wet, in the fog and mud, in crowded, dripping tents and under constantly dripping skies, they carried on and early gave evidence of their powers of endurance and unquenchable spirit.  Lord Roberts made his last public appearance before this division and addressing the men said in part: \"Three months ago we found ourselves involved in this war--a war not of our own seeking, but one which those who have studied Germany\\'s literature and Germany\\'s aspirations, knew was a war which we should inevitably have to deal with sooner or later. The prompt resolve of Canada to give us such valuable assistance has touched us deeply. . . .  \"We are fighting a nation which looks upon the British Empire as a barrier to her development, and has in consequence, long contemplated our overthrow and humiliation. To attain that end she has manufactured a magnificent fighting machine, and is straining every nerve to gain victory.... It is only by the most determined efforts that we can defeat her.\"  And this superb German military organization, created by years of tireless effort, was that which Canadian civilians had volunteered to fight. Was it any wonder that some of the most able leaders doubted whether men and officers, no matter how brave and intelligent, could ever equal the inspired barbarians who, even at that very moment, were battling with the finest British and French regulars and pressing them steadily towards Paris?  In a short chapter of this kind attempting to deal with Canada\\'s effort in the great war it is obviously impossible to go into detail or give more than the briefest of historical pictures. Consequently much that is fascinating can be given but a passing glance: for greater detail larger works must be consulted. Nevertheless it is well to try and view in perspective events as they occurred, in order to obtain some idea of their relative importance.  In February, 1915, the first Canadian division crossed the Channel to France, and began to obtain front-line experiences in a section of the line just north of Neuve Chapelle.  While the first division had been going through its course of training in England a second division had been raised in Canada and arrived in England shortly after the first left it.  During that period the conflict in Europe had passed through certain preliminary phases--most of them fortunate for the Allies. The unexpected holding up of the German armies by the Belgians had prevented the enemy from gaining the channel ports of Calais and Boulogne in the first rush. Later on the battle of the Marne had resulted in the rolling back of the German waves until they had subsided on a line roughly drawn through Dixmude, Ypres, Armentieres, La Bassee, Lens, and southward to the French border and the trench phase of warfare had begun.   [Illustration: Photograph]   ON VIMY RIDGE, WHERE CANADA WON LAURELS   The Canadians took the important position of Vimy Ridge on Easter   Monday, April 9, 1917. They advanced with brilliance, having taken the   whole system of German front-line trenches between dawn and 6.30 A.   M. This shows squads of machine gunners operating from shell-craters   in support of the infantry on the plateau above the ridge.   [Illustration: Photograph]   Photo from Western Newspaper Union   GENERAL SIR ARTHUR CURRIE   Commander of the Canadian forces on the Western Front.   The British held the section of front between Ypres and La-Bassee, about thirty miles in length, the Germans, unfortunately, occupying all the higher grounds.  Shortly after the arrival of the Canadian division the British, concentrating the largest number of guns that had hitherto been gathered together on the French front, made an attack on the Germans at Neuve Chapelle. This attack, only partially successful in gains of terrain, served to teach both belligerents several lessons. It showed the British the need for huge quantities of high explosives with which to blast away wire and trenches and, that in an attack, rifle fire, no matter how accurate, was no match for unlimited numbers of machine guns.  It showed the enemy what could be done with concentrated artillery fire--a lesson that he availed himself of with deadly effect a few weeks later.  Though Canadian artillery took part in that bombardment the infantry was not engaged in the battle of Neuve Chapelle; it received its baptism of fire, however, under excellent conditions, and after a month\\'s experience in trench warfare was taken out of the line for rest.  The division was at the time under the command of a British general and the staff included several highly trained British staff officers. Nevertheless the commands were practically all in the hands of Canadians--lawyers, business men, real-estate agents, newspapermen and other amateur soldiers, who, in civilian life as militiamen, had spent more or less time in the study of the theory of warfare. This should always be kept in mind in view of subsequent events, as well as the fact that these amateur soldiers were faced by armies whose officers and men--professionals in the art and science of warfare--regarded themselves as invincible.  In mid-April the Canadians took over a sector some five thousand yards long in the Ypres salient. On the left they joined up with French colonial troops, and on their right with the British. Thus there were Canadian and French colonial troops side by side.  Toward the end of April the Germans reverted to supreme barbarism and used poison gas. Undismayed, though suffering terrible losses, the heroic Canadians fought the second battle of Ypres and held the line in the face of the most terrific assaults.  When the news of the second battle of Ypres reached Canada her people were profoundly stirred. The blight of war had at last fallen heavily, destroying her first-born, but sorrow was mixed with pride and exaltation that Canadian men had proved a match for the most scientifically trained troops in Europe. As fighters Canadians had at once leaped into front rank. British, Scotch and Irish blood, with British traditions, had proved greater forces than the scientific training and philosophic principles of the Huns. It was a glorious illustration of the axiom \"right is greater than might,\" which the German had in his pride reversed to read \"might is right.\" It was prophetic of what the final issue of a contest based on such divergent principles was to be. So in those days Canadian men and women held their heads higher and carried on their war work with increased determination, stimulated by the knowledge that they were contending with an enemy more remorseless and implacable than those terrible creatures which used to come to them in their childish dreams. It was felt that, a nation which could scientifically and in cold blood resort to poison gases--contrary to all accepted agreements of civilized countries--to gain its object must be fought with all the determination, resources and skill which it was possible to employ.  Canada\\'s heart had been steeled. She was now in the war with her last dollar and her last man if need be. She had begun to realize that failure in Europe would simply transfer the struggle with the German fighting hordes to our Atlantic provinces and the eastern American states.  The famous Princess Patricia\\'s Canadian Light Infantry was originally composed of soldiers who had actually seen service and were therefore veterans. Incidentally they were older men and most of them were married but the call of the Empire was insistent.  In the winter of 1914-15 the British line in Flanders was very thin and the P. P. C. L. I\\'s. being a trained regiment was sent over to France several weeks before the first Canadian division. It soon earned the name of a regiment of extraordinarily hard-fighting qualities and was all but wiped out before spring arrived. The immortal story of this gallant unit must be read in detail if one wishes to obtain any clear conception of their deeds of valor--of what it is possible for man to go through and live. However, it was but one regiment whose exploits were later equaled by other Canadian regiments and it would therefore be invidious to select anyone for special praise. After operating as a separate regiment for nearly two years and having been recruited from the regular Canadian depots in England, it became in composition like other Canadian regiments and was finally incorporated in the third Canadian division.  In the spring of 1915, a Canadian cavalry brigade was formed in France made up of Strathcona\\'s Horse, King Edward\\'s Horse, the Royal Canadian Dragoons and Canadian Mounted Rifles.  After the second battle of Ypres, the Canadians after resting and re-organization, were moved to a section of the line near LaBassee. Here they fought the battle of Festubert--a series of infantry attacks and artillery bombardments, which gained little ground.  Shortly afterwards they fought the battle of Givenchy, equally futile, as far as material results were concerned. Both of these battles had the double object of feeling out the strength of the German line and of obtaining the Aubers Ridge, should the attacks prove successful. In both battles the Canadians showed great aptitude for attack, and tenacity in their hold of captured trenches. They also learned the difficult lesson that if an objective is passed by the infantry the latter enter the zone of their own artillery fire and suffer accordingly.  In September, 1915, the Second Canadian Division arrived in Flanders and took its place at the side of the First Canadian Division, then occupying the Ploegsteert section in front of the Messines-Wytschaete Ridge. The rest of the winter was spent more or less quietly by both divisions in the usual trench warfare, and battling with mud, water and weather.  It was here that the Canadians evolved the \"trench raid,\" a method of cutting off a section of enemy trench, killing or taking prisoners all the enemy inhabitants, destroying it and returning with little or no loss to the attacking party. This method was quickly copied from one end of the Franco-British line to the other; it proved a most valuable method of gaining information, and served to keep the troops, during the long cold winter months, stimulated and keen when otherwise life would have proved most dull and uninteresting.  The Third Canadian Division was formed in January and February, 1916. One infantry brigade was composed of regiments which had been acting as Canadian corps troops, including the Princess Patricia\\'s Canadian Light Infantry, and the Royal Canadian Regiment. The second infantry brigade was made up of six Canadian mounted rifle regiments, which had comprised part of the cavalry brigade. These two brigades, of the Third Division, under the command of General Mercer of Toronto, almost immediately began front-line work.  During this period, the Germans, making desperate efforts extending over weeks of time, did their utmost to break through the French line at Verdun and exhaust the French reserves. To offset these objects, a fourth British army was assembled, which took over still more of the French line, while a series of British attacks, intended to pin down the German reserves all along the line, was inaugurated. One of these developed into a fight for the craters--a terrible struggle at St. Eloi, where, blasted from their muddy ditches, with rifles and machine guns choked with mud and water; with communications lost and lack of artillery support, the men of the Second Canadian Division fought gamely from April 6th to April 20th, but were forced to yield the craters and part of their front line system to the enemy.  Notwithstanding this the men of the Second Canadian Division at St. Eloi fought quite as nobly as had their brothers of the First Division just a year before, at the glorious battle of Ypres, a few miles farther north. But it was a bitter experience. The lesson of failure is as necessary in the education of a nation as that of success.  On June 2d and 3d, the Third Canadian Division, which then occupied part of the line in the Ypres salient, including Hooge and Sanctuary Wood, was smothered by an artillery bombardment unprecedented in length and intensity. Trenches melted into irregular heaps of splintered wood, broken sand bags and mangled bodies. Fighting gallantly the men of this division fell in large numbers, where they stood. The best infantry in the world is powerless against avalanches of shells projected from greatly superior numbers of guns. The Canadian trenches were obliterated, not captured.  By this time Britain had thoroughly learned her lesson, and now countless shells and guns were pouring into France from Great Britain where thousands of factories, new and old, toiled night and day, under the inspiring energy of Mr. Lloyd George.  On June 13th, in a terrific counter-attack, the Canadians in turn blasted the Huns from the trenches taken from them a few days before. The First Canadian Division recaptured and consolidated all the ground and trench systems that had been lost Thus ended the second year of Canadian military operations in the Ypres salient. Each of the three Canadian divisions had been tried by fire in that terrible region, from which, it was said, no man ever returned the same as he entered it. Beneath its torn and rifted surface, thousands of Canadians lie, mute testimony to the fact that love of liberty is still one of the most powerful, yet most intangible, things that man is swayed by.  A very distinguished French general, speaking of the part that Canada was playing in the war, said, \"Nothing in the history of the world has ever been known quite like it. My countrymen are fighting within fifty miles of Paris, to push back and chastise a vile and leprous race, which has violated the chastity of beautiful France, but the Australians at the Dardanelles and the Canadians at Ypres, fought with supreme and absolute devotion for what to many must have seemed simple abstractions, and that nation which will support for an abstraction the horror of this war of all wars will ever hold the highest place in the records of human valor.\"  The Fourth Canadian Division reached the Ypres region in August, 1916, just as the other three Canadian divisions were leaving for the Somme battle-field farther south. For a while it occupied part of the line near Kemmel, but soon followed the other divisions to the Somme, there to complete the Canadian corps.  It may be stated here that though a fifth Canadian division was formed and thoroughly trained in England, it never reached France. Canada, until the passing of the Military Service Act on July 6,1917, depended solely on voluntary enlistment. Up to that time Canada, with a population of less than 9,000,000, had recruited 525,000 men by voluntary methods. Of this number 356,986 had actually gone overseas. Voluntary methods at last, however, failed to supply drafts in sufficient numbers to keep up the strength of the depleted reserves in England, and in consequence conscription was decided upon. By this means, 56,000 men were drafted in Canada before the war ended. In the meantime, through heavy fighting the demand for drafts became so insistent that the Fifth Canadian Division in England had to be broken up to reinforce the exhausted fighting divisions in France.  It would be an incomplete summary of Canada\\'s part in the war that did not mention some of the men who have been responsible for the success of Canadian arms. It is obviously impossible to mention all of those responsible; it is even harder to select a few. But looking backward one sees two figures that stand forth from all the rest--General Sir Sam Hughes in Canada, and General Sir Arthur Currie commander of the Canadian corps.  To General Sir Sam Hughes must be given the credit of having foreseen war with Germany and making such preparations as were possible in a democracy like Canada. He it was of all others who galvanized Canada into action; he it was whose enthusiasm and driving power were so contagious that they affected not only his subordinates but the country at large.  Sir Sam Hughes will be remembered for the building of Valcartier camp and the dispatch of the first Canadian contingent. But he did things of just as great importance. It was he who sought and obtained for Canada, huge orders for munitions from Great Britain and thereby made it possible for Canada to weather the financial depression, pay her own war expenditures and emerge from the war in better financial shape than she was when the war broke out. It was easy to build up a business once established but the chief credit must go to the man who established it.  Sir Sam Hughes was also responsible for the selection of the officers who went overseas with the first Canadian contingent. Among those officers who subsequently became divisional commanders were General Sir Arthur Currie, General Sir Richard Turner, General Sir David Watson, Generals Lipsett, Mercer and Hughes.  Of these generals, Sir Arthur Currie through sheer ability ultimately became commander of the Canadian corps. This big, quiet man, whose consideration, prudence and brilliancy had won the absolute confidence of Canadian officers and men alike, welded the Canadian corps into a fighting force of incomparable effectiveness--a force which was set the most difficult tasks and, as events proved, not in vain.  When Canada entered the war she had a permanent force of 3,000 men. When hostilities ceased on November 11, 1918, Canada had sent overseas 418,980 soldiers. In addition to this about 15,000 men had joined the British Royal Air Service, several hundred physicians and veterinarians, as well as 200 nurses, had been supplied to the British army, while many hundreds of university men had received commissions in the imperial army and navy.  In September, October and November, 1916, the Canadian corps of four divisions, which had been welded by General Byng and General Currie into an exceedingly efficient fighting machine, took its part in the battle of the Somme--a battle in which the British army assumed the heaviest share of the fighting and casualties, and shifted the greatest burden of the struggle from the shoulders of the French to their own. The British army had grown vastly in power and efficiency and in growing had taken over more and more of the line from the French.  The battle of the Somme was long and involved. The Franco-British forces were everywhere victorious and by hard and continuous fighting forced the Hun back to the famous Hindenburg line. It was in this battle that the tanks, evolved by the British, were used for the first time, and played a most important part in breaking down wire entanglements and rounding up the machine gun nests. The part played in this battle by the Canadian corps was conspicuous, and it especially distinguished itself by the capture of Courcelette. Although the battles which the Canadian corps took part in subsequently were almost invariably both successful and important, they can be merely mentioned here. The Canadian corps now known everywhere to consist of shock troops second to none on the western front, was frequently used as the spearhead with which to pierce particularly tough parts of the enemy defenses.  On April 9th to 13th, 1917, the Canadian corps, with some British support, captured Vimy Ridge, a point which had hitherto proved invulnerable. When a year later, the Germans, north and south, swept the British line to one side in gigantic thrusts they were unable to disturb this key point, Vimy Ridge, which served as an anchor to the sagging line. The Canadian corps was engaged at Arleux and Fresnoy in April and May and was effective in the operations around Lens in June. Again on August 15th, it was engaged at Hill 70 and fought with conspicuous success in that toughest, most difficult, and most heart-breaking of all battles--Passchendaele.  In 1918, the Canadian Cavalry Brigade won distinction in the German offensive of March and April. On August 12, 1918, the Canadian corps was engaged in the brilliantly successful battle of Amiens, which completely upset the German offensive plan. On August 26th to 28th the Canadians captured Monchy-le-Preux, and, in one of the hammer blows which Foch rained on the German front, were given the most difficult piece of the whole line to pierce--the Queant-Drocourt line. This section of the famous Hindenburg line was considered by the enemy to be absolutely impregnable, but was captured by the Canadians on September 3d and 4th. With this line outflanked a vast German retreat began, which ended on November 11th with the signing of the armistice.  To the Canadians fell the honors of breaking through the first Hindenburg line by the capture of Cambrai, on October 1st to 9th. They also took Douai on October 19th, and Dena on October 20th. On October 26th to November 2d they had the signal honor of capturing Valenciennes thereby being the first troops to break through the fourth and last Hindenberg line.  It surely was a curious coincidence that Mons, from which the original British army--the best trained, it is said, that has taken the field since the time of Caesar--began its retreat in 1914, should have been the town which Canadian civilians were destined to recapture. The war began for the professional British army--the Contemptibles--when it began its retreat from Mons in 1914; the war ended for the British army at the very same town four years and three months later, when on the day the armistice was signed the men from Canada re-entered it. Was it coincidence, or was it fate?  During the war Canadian troops had sustained 211,000 casualties, 152,000 had been wounded and more than 50,000 had made the supreme sacrifice. Put into different language this means that the number of Canadians killed was just a little greater than the total number of infantrymen in their corps of four divisions.  The extent of the work involved in the care of the wounded and sick of the Canadians overseas may be gathered from the fact that Canada equipped and sent across the Atlantic, 7 general hospitals, 10 stationary hospitals, 16 field ambulances, 3 sanitary sections, 4 casualty clearing stations and advanced and base depots of medical stores: The personnel of these medical units consisted of 1,612 officers, 1,994 nursing sisters and 12,382 of other ranks, or a total of about 16,000. This will give some conception of the importance of the task involved in the caring for the sick and wounded of about 90,000 fighting troops, some 60,000 auxiliary troops behind the lines and the reserve depots in England.   [Illustration: Map]   FROM THE VOSGES MOUNTAINS TO YPRES   Map showing the Northeastern frontiers of France, and neutral Belgium   through which the German armies poured in 1914. The battle line held   straight from Belfort to Verdun, with the exception of the St. Mihiel   salient. Above Verdun the line veered to the west, north of Rheims,   marking a wide curve toward St. Quentin and Arras and bending back to   Ypres, held by the Canadians throughout the war.   The work of the Canadian Red Cross Society included the building and equipping of auxiliary hospitals to those of the Canadian Army Medical Corps; providing of extra and emergency stores of all kinds, recreation huts, ambulances and lorries, drugs, serums and surgical equipment calculated to make hospitals more efficient; the looking after the comfort of patients in hospitals providing recreation and entertainment to the wounded, and dispatching regularly to every Canadian prisoner parcels of food, as well as clothes, books and other necessaries: The Canadian Red Cross expended on goods for prisoners in 1917 nearly $600,000.  In all the Canadian Red Cross distributed since the beginning of the war to November 23, 1918, $7,631,100.  The approximate total of voluntary contributions from Canada for war purposes was over $90,000,000.  The following figures quoted from tables issued by the Department of Public Information at Ottawa, show the exports in certain Canadian commodities, having a direct bearing on the war for the last three fiscal years before the war (1912-13-14), and for the last fiscal year (1918); and illustrates the increase, during this period, in the value of these articles exported:                                     VALUES                    Average for 1912-1913-1914      1918 Foodstuffs                       $143,133,374   $617,515,690 Clothing, metals, leather, etc     45,822,717    215,873,357                                   -----------    ----------- Total                            $188,956,091   $833,389,047  As practically all of the increase of food and other materials went to Great Britain, France and Italy, the extent of Canada\\'s effort in upholding the allied cause is clearly evident and was by no means a small one.  The trade of Canada for 1914 was one billion dollars; for the fiscal year of 1917-18 it was two and one-half billion dollars.  Approximately 60,000,000 shells were made in Canada during the war. Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities a shell committee was formed in Canada to really act as an agent for the British war office in placing contracts. The first shells were shipped in December, 1914, and by the end of May, 1915, approximately 400 establishments were manufacturing shells in Canada. By November, 1915, orders had been placed by the Imperial Government to the value of $300,000,000, and an Imperial Munitions Board, replacing the shell committee, was formed, directly responsible to the Imperial Ministry of Munitions.

There, with the gateway to Paris lying open at its back, the French army, in the longest pitched battle in all history, held like a cold blue rock against the uttermost man power and resources of the German army.  General von Falkenhayn, Chief of the German General Staff and military dictator of the Teutonic allies, there met disaster and disgrace. There the mettle of the Crown Prince was tested and he was found to be merely a thing of straw, a weak creature whose mind was under the domination of von Falkenhayn.  For the tremendous offensive which was planned to end the war by one terrific thrust, von Falkenhayn had robbed all the other fronts of effective men and munitions. Field Marshal von Hindenburg and his crafty Chief of Staff, General Ludendorf, had planned a campaign against Russia designed to put that tottering military Colossus out of the war. The plans were upon a scale that might well have proved successful. The Kaiser, influenced by the Crown Prince and by von Falkenhayn, decreed that the Russian campaign must be postponed and that von Hindenburg must send his crack troops to join the army of the Crown Prince fronting Verdun. Ludendorf promptly resigned as Chief of Staff to von Hindenburg and suggested that the Field Marshal also resign. That grim old warrior declined to take this action, preferring to remain idle in East Prussia and watch what he predicted would be a useless effort on the western front. His warning to the General Staff was explicit, but von Falkenhayn coolly ignored the message.   [Illustration: Map: Verdun in the Southwest corner, to Maucourt toward the Northeast.]   IMMORTAL VERDUN, WHERE THE FRENCH HELD THE GERMANS WITH THE INSPIRING   SLOGAN \"THEY SHALL NOT PASS\"   Why did Germany select this particular point for its grand offensive? The answer is to be found in a demand made by the great Junker associations of Germany in May, 1915, nine months before the attack was undertaken. That demand was to the effect that Verdun should be attacked and captured. They declared that the Verdun fortifications made a menacing salient thrust into the rich iron fields of the Briey basin. From this metalliferous field of Lorraine came the ore that supplied eighty per cent of the steel required for German and Austrian guns and munitions. These fields of Briey were only twenty miles from the great guns of Verdun. They were French territory at the beginning of the war and had been seized by the army of the Crown Prince, co-operating with the Army of Metz because of their immense value to the Germans in war making.  As a preliminary to the battle, von Falkenhayn placed a semicircle of huge howitzers and rifles around the field of Briey. Then assembling the vast forces drained from all the fronts and having erected ammunition dumps covering many acres, the great battle commenced with a surprise attack upon the village of Haumont on February 21, 1916.  The first victory of the Germans at that point was an easy one. The great fort of Douaumont was the next objective. This was taken on February 25th after a concentrated bombardment that for intensity surpassed anything that heretofore had been shown in the war.  Von Falkenhayn, personally superintending the disposition of guns and men, had now penetrated the outer defenses of Verdun. The tide was running against the French, and shells, more shells for the guns of all caliber; men, more men for the earthworks surrounding the devoted city were needed. The narrow-gauge railway connecting Verdun with the great French depots of supplies was totally inadequate for the transportation burdens suddenly cast upon it. In this desperate emergency a transport system was born of necessity, a system that saved Verdun. It was fleet upon fleet of motor trucks, all sizes, all styles; anything that could pack a few shells or a handful of men was utilized. The backbone of the system was a great fleet of trucks driven by men whose average daily rest was four hours, and upon whose horizon-blue uniforms the stains of snow and sleet, of dust and mud, were indelibly fixed through the winter, spring, summer and fall of 1916, for the glorious engagement continued from February 21st until November 2d, when the Germans were forced into full retreat from the field of honor, the evacuation of Fort Vaux putting a period to Germany\\'s disastrous plan and to von Falkenhayn\\'s military career.  Lord Northcliffe, describing the early days of the immortal battle, wrote:  \"Verdun is, in many ways, the most extraordinary of battles. The mass of metal used on both sides is far beyond all parallel; the transformation on the Douaumont Ridge was more suddenly dramatic than even the battle of the Marne; and, above all, the duration of the conflict already looks as if it would surpass anything in history. More than a month has elapsed since, by the kindness of General Joffre and General Petain, I was able to watch the struggle from various vital viewpoints. The battle had then been raging with great intensity for a fortnight, and, as I write, four to five thousand guns are still thundering round Verdun. Impossible, therefore, any man to describe the entire battle. The most one can do is to set down one\\'s impressions of the first phases of a terrible conflict, the end of which cannot be foreseen.  \"My chief impression is one of admiration for the subtle powers of mind of the French High Command. General Joffre and General Castelnau are men with especially fine intellects tempered to terrible keenness. Always they have had to contend against superior numbers. In 1870, when they were subalterns, their country lost the advantage of its numerous population by abandoning general military service at a time when Prussia was completely realizing the idea of a nation in arms. In 1914, when they were commanders, France was inferior to a still greater degree in point of numbers to Prussianized Germany. In armament, France was inferior at first to her enemy. The French High Command has thus been trained by adversity to do all that human intellect can against almost overwhelming hostile material forces. General Joffre, General Castelnau--and, later, General Petain, who at a moment\\'s notice displaced General Herr--had to display genius where the Germans were exhibiting talent, and the result is to be seen at Verdun. They there caught the enemy in a series of traps of a kind hitherto unknown in modern warfare--something elemental, and yet subtle, neo-primitive, and befitting the atavistic character of the Teuton. They caught him in a web of his own unfulfilled boasts.  \"The enemy began by massing a surprising force on the western front. Tremendous energy and organizing power were the marks of his supreme efforts to obtain a decision. It was usually reckoned that the Germans maintain on all fronts a field army of about seventy-four and a half army corps, which at full strength number three million men. Yet, while holding the Russians from Riga to the south of the Pripet Marshes, and maintaining a show of force in the Balkans, Germany seems to have succeeded in bringing up nearly two millions and a half of men for her grand spring offensive in the west. At one time her forces in France and Flanders were only ninety divisions. But troops and guns were withdrawn in increasing numbers from Russia and Serbia in December, 1915, until there were, it is estimated, a hundred and eighteen divisions on the Franco-British-Belgian front. A large number of six-inch and twelve-inch Austrian howitzers were added to the enormous Krupp batteries. Then a large proportion of new recruits of the 1916 class were moved into Rhine-land depots to serve as drafts for the fifty-nine army corps, and it is thought that nearly all the huge shell output that had accumulated during the winter was transported westward.  \"The French Staff reckoned that Verdun would be attacked when the ground had dried somewhat in the March winds. It was thought that the enemy movement would take place against the British front in some of the sectors of which there were chalk undulations, through which the rains of winter quickly drained. The Germans skilfully encouraged this idea by making an apparent preliminary attack at Lions, on a five-mile front with rolling gas-clouds and successive waves of infantry. During this feint the veritable offensive movement softly began on Saturday, February 19, 1916, when the enormous masses of hostile artillery west, east, and north of the Verdun salient started registering on the French positions. Only in small numbers did the German guns fire, in order not to alarm their opponents. But even this trial bombardment by shifts was a terrible display of power, calling forth all the energies of the outnumbered French gunners to maintain the artillery duels that continued day and night until Monday morning, February 21st.

[Illustration: Photograph]   Copyright Underwood and Underwood, N. Y.   CAPTAIN CHARLES A. FRYATT   The martyred British Merchant-Marine Captain, who was executed by the   Germans because his ship attempted to sink a German submarine which   attacked her.   \"The enemy seems to have maintained a bombardment all round General Herr\\'s lines on February 21, 1916, but this general battering was done with a thousand pieces of field artillery. The grand masses of heavy howitzers were used in a different way. At a quarter past seven in the morning they concentrated on the small sector of advanced intrenchments near Brabant and the Meuse; twelve-inch shells fell with terrible precision every few yards, according to the statements made by the French troops. I afterwards saw a big German shell, from at least six miles distant from my place of observation, hit quite a small target. So I can well believe that, in the first bombardment of French positions, which had been photographed from the air and minutely measured and registered by the enemy gunners in the trial firing, the great, destructive shots went home with extraordinary effect. The trenches were not bombarded--they were obliterated. In each small sector of the six-mile northward bulge of the Verdun salient the work of destruction was done with surprising quickness.  \"After the line from Brabant to Haumont was smashed, the main fire power was directed against the other end of the bow at Herbebois, Ornes, and Maucourt. Then when both ends of the bow were severely hammered, the central point of the Verdun salient, Caures Woods, was smothered in shells of all sizes, poured in from east, north and west. In this manner almost the whole enormous force of heavy artillery was centered upon mile after mile of the French front. When the great guns lifted over the lines of craters, the lighter field artillery placed row after row in front of the wreckage, maintained an unending fire curtain over the communicating saps and support intrenchments.  \"Then came the second surprising feature in the new German system of attack. No waves of storming infantry swept into the battered works. Only strong patrols at first came cautiously forward, to discover if it were safe for the main body of troops to advance and reorganize the French line so as to allow the artillery to move onward. There was thus a large element of truth in the marvelous tales afterwards told by German prisoners. Their commanders thought it would be possible to do all the fighting with long-range artillery, leaving the infantry to act as squatters to the great guns and occupy and rebuild line after line of the French defenses without any serious hand-to-hand struggles. All they had to do was to protect the gunners from surprise attack, while the guns made an easy path for them.  \"But, ingenious as was this scheme for saving the man-power of Germany by an unparalleled expenditure of shell, it required for full success the co-operation of the French troops. But the French did not co-operate. Their High Command had continually improved their system of trench defense in accordance with the experiences of their own hurricane bombardments in Champagne and the Carency sector. General Castelnau, the acting Commander-in-Chief on the French front, was indeed the inventor of hurricane fire tactics, which he had used for the first time in February, 1915, in Champagne. When General Joffre took over the conduct of all French operations, leaving to General Castelnau the immediate control of the front in France, the victor of the battle of Nancy weakened his advance lines and then his support lines, until his troops actually engaged in fighting were very little more than a thin covering body, such as is thrown out towards the frontier while the main forces connect well behind.  \"We shall see the strategical effect of this extraordinary measure in the second phase of the Verdun battle, but its tactical effect was to leave remarkably few French troops exposed to the appalling tempest of German and Austrian shells. The fire-trench was almost empty, and in many cases the real defenders of the French line were men with machine guns, hidden in dug-outs at some distance from the photographed positions at which the German gunners aimed. The batteries of light guns, which the French handled with the flexibility and continuity of fire of Maxims, were also concealed in widely scattered positions. The main damage caused by the first intense bombardment was the destruction of all the telephone wires along the French front. In one hour the German guns plowed up every yard of ground behind the observing posts and behind the fire trench. Communications could only be slowly re-established by messengers, so that many parties of men had to fight on their own initiative, with little or no combination of effort with their comrades.  \"Yet, desperate as were their circumstances, they broke down the German plan for capturing trenches without an infantry attack. They caught the patrols and annihilated them, and then swept back the disillusioned and reluctant main bodies of German troops. First, the bombing parties were felled, then the sappers as they came forward to repair the line for their infantry, and at last the infantry itself in wave after wave of field-gray. The small French garrison of every center of resistance fought with cool, deadly courage, and often to the death.  \"Artillery fire was practically useless against them, for though their tunnel shelters were sometimes blown in by the twelve-inch shells, which they regarded as their special terror by reason of their penetrative power and wide blast, even the Germans had not sufficient shells to search out all their underground chambers, every one of which have two or three exits.  \"The new organization of the French Machine-gun Corps was a fine factor in the eventual success. One gun fired ten thousand rounds daily for a week, most of the positions selected being spots from which each German infantry advance would be enfiladed and shattered. Then the French 75\\'s which had been masked during the overwhelming fire of the enemy howitzers, came unexpectedly into action when the German infantry attacks increased in strength. Near Haumont, for example, eight successive furious assaults were repulsed by three batteries of 75\\'s. One battery was then spotted by the Austrian twelve-inch guns, but it remained in action until all its ammunition was exhausted. The gunners then blew up their guns and retired, with the loss of only one man.  \"Von Falkenhayn had increased the Crown Prince\\'s army from the fourteen divisions--that battled at Douaumont Fort--to twenty-five divisions. In April he added five more divisions to the forces around Verdun by weakening the effectives in other sectors and drawing more troops from the Russian front. It was rumored that von Hindenburg was growing restive and complaining that the wastage at Verdun would tell against the success of the campaign on the Riga-Dvinsk front, which was to open when the Baltic ice melted.  \"Great as was the wastage of life, it was in no way immediately decisive. But when the expenditure of shells almost outran the highest speed of production of the German munition factories, and the wear on the guns was more than Krupp and Skoda could make good, there was danger to the enemy in beginning another great offensive likely to overtax his shellmakers and gunmakers.\"  Immortal and indomitable France had won over her foe more power than she had possessed even after the battle of the Marne.  Throughout the entire summer Verdun, with the whole population of France roused to the supreme heights of heroism behind it, held like a rock. Wave after wave of Germans in gray-green lines were sent against the twenty-five miles of earthworks, while the French guns took their toll of the crack German regiments. German dead lay upon the field until exposed flesh became the same ghastly hue of their uniforms. No Man\\'s Land around Verdun was a waste and a stench.  General Joffre\\'s plan was very simple. It was to hold out. As was afterwards revealed, much to the satisfaction of the French people, Sir Douglas Haig had placed himself completely at the service of the French Commander-in-Chief, and had suggested that he should use the British army to weaken the thrust at Verdun. But General Joffre had refused the proffered help. No man knew better than he what his country, with its exceedingly low birthrate, was suffering on the Meuse. He had but to send a telegram to British Headquarters, and a million Britons, with thousands of heavy guns, would fling themselves upon the German lines and compel Falkenhayn to divide his shell output, his heavy artillery, and his millions of men between Verdun and the Somme. But General Joffre, instead of sending the telegram in question, merely dispatched officers to British Headquarters to assure and calm the chafing Scotsman commanding the military forces of the British Empire.  Throughout that long summer the battle cry of Verdun, \"Ne passeront pas!\" (\"They shall not pass!\"), was an inspiration to the French army and to the world. Then as autumn drifted its red foliage over the heights surrounding the bloody field, the French struck back. General Nivelle, who had taken command at Verdun under Joffre, commenced a series of attacks and a persistent pressure against the German forces on both sides of the Meuse. These thrusts culminated in a sudden sweeping attack which on October 24th, resulted in the recapture by Nivelle\\'s forces of Fort Douaumont and on November 2d, in the recapture of Fort Vaux.  Thus ended in glory the most inspiring battle in the long and honorable history of France.    CHAPTER XXVII  MURDERS AND MARTYRS  Many examples might be cited to show that the Central empires were dead to the humanities. There were apparently no limits to the brutality of the German war-makers. Among the outstanding deeds of the Teutons that sickened the world was the killing of Miss Edith Cavell, an English nurse working in Belgian hospitals.  A shudder of horror circled the world when announcement was formally made that this splendid woman was sentenced to death and murdered by a German firing squad at two o\\'clock on the morning of October 12, 1915.  The killing of this gentle-natured, brave woman typified to the world Germany\\'s essentially brutal militarism. It placed the German military command in a niche of dishonor unique in all history.  The specific charge against Miss Cavell was that she had helped English and French soldiers and Belgian young male civilians to cross the border into Holland. The direct evidence against her was in the form of letters intercepted by the Germans in which some of these soldiers and civilians writing from England thanked her for the aid she had given to them.  Upon the farcical trial that resulted in the predetermined sentence of death, Miss Cavell courageously and freely admitted her assistance in the specified cases of escape. When she was asked why she did it, she declared her fear that if she had not done so the men would have been shot by the Germans. Her testimony was given in a clear conversational tone that betrayed no nervousness and her entire bearing was such as to win the sympathy of everyone except her stony-hearted judges.  The German officers in command at Brussels made it impossible for Miss Cavell to see counsel before the trial, and a number of able lawyers who were solicited to undertake her defense declined to do so because of their fear of the Germans.  Sentence was imposed upon her at five o\\'clock on the afternoon of October 11th. In accordance with its terms, she was taken from her cell and placed against a blank wall at two o\\'clock the following morning--the darkness of the hour vying with the blackness of the deed. Mr. Gahan, the English clergyman connected with the prison, was permitted to see her a short time before her murder. He gave her Holy Communion at ten o\\'clock on the night of October 11th. To him she declared she was happy in her contemplation of death; that she had no regret for what she had done; and that she was glad to die for her country.  Brand Whitlock, American Minister to Belgium, and Hugh Gibson, Secretary of the Legation, did all that was humanly possible to avert the crime, but without avail. They were told that, \"the Emperor himself could not intervene.\"  Defending the murder, Dr. Alfred Zimmermann, German Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, callously disposed of the matter thus:  \"I see from the English and American press that the shooting of an Englishwoman and the condemnation of several other women in Brussels for treason has caused a sensation, and capital against us is being made out of the fact. Men and women are equal before the law, and only the degree of guilt makes a difference in the sentence for the crime and its consequences.\"  Monuments to Edith Cavell were reared in widely scattered communities. A mountain was named in her honor. Her murder multiplied enlistments and fed the fires of patriotism throughout the Allied countries. In the end, Germany lost heavily. The Teutons aimed to strike terror into the hearts of men and women. They only succeeded in arousing a righteous anger that ultimately destroyed the Imperial government.  Another instance equally flagrant of the utter callousness of the men who at that time ruled Germany, was the murder of Captain Fryatt, a gallant British seaman, who had dared to attack the pirates of the under-seas.  Captain Charles Fryatt was the master of the steamship Brussels, a merchant vessel owned by the Great Eastern Railway. It was captured by the Germans on June 23, 1916. Captain Fryatt was taken to Zeebrugge. A court-martial went through the motions of a trial at Bruges on July 27th. The charge against Captain Fryatt was that of attempting to ram the German submarine U-33.  Mute testimony against Captain Fryatt was a gold watch found upon his person. This carried an inscription testifying that the watch had been presented by the mayor and people of Harwich in recognition of the Captain\\'s bravery in attempting to ram a submarine, and his successful escape when the U-boat called upon him to surrender.  The prisoners who were captured with Captain Fryatt were sent to the prison camp at Ruhlaben, but Captain Fryatt was condemned to death as a \"franc-tireur.\" The news of the murder was sent to the world through a German communique dated July 28th. It stated:   The accused was condemned to death because, although he was not a member of a combatant force, he made an attempt on the afternoon of March 20, 1915, to ram the German submarine U-33 near the Maas lightship. The accused, as well as the first officer and the chief engineer of the steamer, received at the time from the British Admiralty a gold watch as a reward of his brave conduct on that occasion, and his action was mentioned with praise in the House of Commons.  On the occasion in question, disregarding the U-boat\\'s signal to stop and show his national flag, he turned at a critical moment at high speed on the submarine, which escaped the steamer by a few meters only by immediately diving. He confessed that in so doing he had acted in accordance with the instructions of the Admiralty. One of the many nefarious franc-tireur proceedings of the British merchant marine against our war vessels has thus found a belated but merited expiation.   This brutal action by Germany coming after the murder of Edith Cavell created intense indignation throughout the world. It ranked with the poison gas at Ypres, the Lusitania, the Belgian atrocities, the killing of Edith Cavell and the unrestricted submarine sinkings, as a factor in arousing the democratic peoples of the world to a fighting pitch.  Germany sowed its seeds of destruction in the wind that bore the fumes of poison gas, and in the ruthless brutality that decreed the sinking of the Lusitania and the murders of Edith Cavell and Captain Fryatt.  It reaped the whirlwind in the world-wide wrath that brought America into the war, and that visited disgrace and defeat upon the German Empire.    CHAPTER XXVIII  THE SECOND BATTLE OF YPRES  First to feel the effects of German terrorism through poison gas were the gallant Canadian troops on the afternoon of April 22, 1915, at Ypres, Belgium. Gas had been used by the Germans previously to this, but they were mere experimental clouds directed against Belgian troops.  Before the battle, the English and Canadians held a line from Broodseinde to half a mile north of St. Julien on the crest of the Grafenstafel Ridge. The French prolonged the line to Steenstraate on the Yperlee Canal. The Germans originally planned the attack for Tuesday, April 20th, but with satanic ingenuity the offensive was postponed until between 4 and 5 o\\'clock on the afternoon of Thursday, the 22d. During the morning the wind blew steadily from the north and the scientists attached to the German Field Headquarters predicted that the strong wind would continue at least twelve hours longer.  The Canadian division held a line extending about five miles from the Ypres-Roulers Railway to the Ypres-Poelcapelle road. The division consisted of three infantry brigades, in addition to the artillery brigades. Upon this unsuspecting body of men the poison fumes were projected by means of pipes and force pumps. The immediate consequences were that the asphyxiating gas of great intensity rendered immediately helpless thousands of men. The same gas attack that was projected upon the Canadians also fell with murderous effect upon the French. The consequences were that the French division on the left of the Canadians gave way and the Third brigade of the Canadian division, so far as the left was concerned, was \"up in the air,\" to use the phrase of its commanding officer.  It became necessary for Brigadier-General Turner, commanding the Third brigade, to throw back his left flank southward to protect his rear. This caused great confusion, and the enemy, advancing rapidly, took a number of guns and many prisoners, penetrating to the village of St. Julien, two miles in the rear of the original French trenches. The Canadians fought heroically, although greatly outnumbered and pounded by artillery that inflicted tremendous losses. The Germans, as they came through the gas clouds, were protected by masks moistened with a solution containing bi-carbonate of soda.  The tactics of General Turner off-set the numerical superiority of the enemy, and prevented a disastrous rout. General Curry, commanding the Second brigade of Canadians, repeated this successful maneuver when he flung his left flank southward and, presenting two fronts to the enemy, held his line of trenches from Thursday at 5 o\\'clock until Sunday afternoon. The reason the trenches were held no longer than Sunday afternoon was that they had been obliterated by heavy artillery fire. The Germans finally succeeded in capturing a line, the forward point of which was the village of St. Julien. Reinforcements under General Alderson had come up by this time and the enemy\\'s advance was suddenly checked. Enemy attacks upon the line running from Ypres to Passchendaele completely broke down under the withering fire of the reinforced and reformed artillery and infantry brigades. The record officer of the Canadians makes this comment of the detailed fighting:  The story of the second battle of Ypres is the story of how the Canadian division, enormously outnumbered--for they had in front of them at least four divisions, supported by immensely heavy artillery, with a gap still existing, though reduced, in their lines, and with dispositions made hurriedly under the stimulus of critical danger, fought through the day and through the night, and then through another day and night; fought under their officers until, as happened to so many, those perished gloriously, and then fought from the impulsion of sheer valor because they came from fighting stock.  The enemy, of course, was aware--whether fully or not may perhaps be doubted--of the advantage his breach in the line had given him, and immediately began to push a formidable series of attacks upon the whole of the newly-formed Canadian salient. The attack was everywhere fierce, but developed with particular intensity at this moment upon the apex of the newly-formed line, running in the direction of St. Julien.  It has already been stated that some British guns were taken in a wood comparatively early in the evening of the 22d. In the course of that night, and under the heaviest machine-gun fire, this wood was assaulted by the Canadian Scottish, Sixteenth battalion of the Third brigade, and the Tenth battalion of the Second brigade, which was intercepted for this purpose on its way to a reserve trench. The battalions were respectively commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Leckie and Lieutenant-Colonel Boyle, and after a most fierce struggle in the light of a misty moon they took the position at the point of the bayonet. At midnight the Second battalion, under Colonel Watson, and the Toronto regiment, Queen\\'s Own, Third battalion, under Lieutenant-Colonel Rennie, both of the First brigade, brought up much-needed reinforcement, and though not actually engaged in the assault, were in reserve.  All through the following days and nights these battalions shared the fortunes and misfortunes of the Third brigade. An officer who took part in the attack describes how the men about him fell under the fire of the machine guns, which, in his phrase, played upon them \"like a watering pot.\" He added quite simply \"I wrote my own life off.\" But the line never wavered. When one man fell another took his place, and with a final shout the survivors of the two battalions flung themselves into the wood. The German garrison was completely demoralized, and the impetuous advance of the Canadians did not cease until they reached the far side of the wood and intrenched themselves there in the position so dearly gained. They had, however, the disappointment of finding that the guns had been blown up by the enemy, and later on in the same night a most formidable concentration of artillery fire, sweeping the wood as a tropical storm sweeps the leaves from a forest, made it impossible for them to hold the position for which they had sacrificed so much.  The fighting continued without intermission all through the night, and, to those who observed the indications that the attack was being pushed with ever-growing strength, it hardly seemed possible that the Canadians, fighting in positions so difficult to defend and so little the subject of deliberate choice, could maintain their resistance for any long period. At 6 A. M. on Friday it became apparent that the left was becoming more and more involved, and a powerful German attempt to outflank it developed rapidly. The consequences, if it had been broken or outflanked, need not be insisted upon. They were not merely local.  It was there decided, formidable as the attempt undoubtedly was, to try and give relief by a counter-attack upon the first line of German trenches, now far, far advanced from those originally occupied by the French. This was carried out by the Ontario First and Fourth battalions of the First brigade, under Brigadier-General Mercer, acting in combination with a British brigade.   [Illustration: Map: Ypres and the surroundings.]   THE TOWN OF YPRES IS FULL OF MEMORIES FOR THE CANADIANS   It is safe to say that the youngest private in the rank, as he set his teeth for the advance, knew the task in front of him, and the youngest subaltern knew all that rested upon its success. It did not seem that any human being could live in the shower of shot and shell which began to play upon the advancing troops. They suffered terrible casualties. For a short time every other man seemed to fall, but the attack was pressed ever closer and closer.  The Fourth Canadian battalion at one moment came under a particularly withering fire. For a moment--not more--it wavered. Its most gallant commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Burchill, carrying, after an old fashion, a light cane, coolly and cheerfully rallied his men and, at the very moment when his example had infected them, fell dead at the head of his battalion. With a hoarse cry of anger they sprang forward (for, indeed they loved him), as if to avenge his death. The astonishing attack which followed--pushed home in the face of direct frontal fire made in broad daylight by battalions whose names should live forever in the memories of soldiers--was carried to the front line of the German trenches. After a hand-to-hand struggle the last German who resisted was bayoneted, and the trench was won.  The measure of this success may be taken when it is pointed out that this trench represented in the German advance the apex in the breach which the enemy had made in the original line of the Allies, and that it was two and a half miles south of that line. This charge, made by men who looked death indifferently in the face (for no man who took part in it could think that he was likely to live) saved, and that was much, the Canadian left. But it did more. Up to the point where the assailants conquered, or died, it secured and maintained during the most critical moment of all the integrity of the allied line. For the trench was not only taken, it was held thereafter against all comers, and in the teeth of every conceivable projectile, until the night of Sunday, the 25th, when all that remained of the war-broken but victorious battalion was relieved by fresh troops.    CHAPTER XXIX  ZEPPELIN RAIDS ON FRANCE AND ENGLAND  The idea of warfare in the air has been a dream of romancers from a period long before Jules Verne. Indeed, balloons were used for observation purposes in the eighteenth century by the French armies. The crude balloon of that period, in a more developed form, was used in the Franco-Prussian War, and during the siege of Paris by its assistance communication was kept up between Paris and the outside world. Realizing its possibilities inventors had been trying to develop a balloon which could be propelled against the wind and so guided that explosives could be dropped upon a hostile army. Partially successful dirigible balloons have been occasionally exhibited for a number of years.  The idea of such a balloon took a strong hold upon the imagination of the German army staff long before the Great War, and Count Ferdinand Zeppelin gave the best years of his life to its development. From the beginning he met with great difficulties. His first ships proved mechanical failures, and after these difficulties were overcome he met with a series of accidents which almost put an end to his efforts. By popular subscription, and by government support, he was able to continue, and when the war began Germany had thirty-five dirigible balloons of the Zeppelin and other types, many of them as much as 490 feet long.  The Zeppelin balloon, called the Zeppelin from the name of its inventor, was practically a vast ship, capable of carrying a load of about fifteen thousand pounds. It would carry a crew of twenty men or more, fuel for the engines, provisions, a wireless installation, and armament with ammunition. For a journey of twenty hours such a vessel would need at least seven thousand pounds of fuel. It would probably be able to carry about two tons of explosives. These Zeppelins could travel great distances. Before the war one of them flew from Lake Constance to Berlin, a continuous flight of about one thousand miles, in thirty-one hours.  These great aerial warships were given a thorough trial by the Germans. They disliked to admit that they had made a costly mistake in adding them to their armament. It soon turned out, however, that the Zeppelins were practically useless in battle. Whatever they could do, either for scouting purposes or in dropping explosives behind the enemy\\'s lines, could be better done by the airplane. The French and the English, who before the war had decided that the airplane was the more important weapon, were right. But the Germans did not give up their costly toy so easily, and they determined to use it in the bombardment of cities and districts situated far away from the German line, in dropping bombs, not upon fortifications, or armed camps where they might meet with resistance, but upon peaceful non-belligerents in the streets of great unfortified cities.  It was their policy of frightfulness once again. And once again they had made a mistake. The varied expeditions of the Zeppelin airships sent from Germany to bombard Paris, or to cross the Channel and, after dropping bombs on seaside resorts, to wander over the city of London in the hope of spreading destruction there, did little real damage and their net effects, from a military point of view, were practically nil.  The first Zeppelin raid upon England took place on January 19, 1915. The Zeppelins passed over the cities of Yarmouth, Cromer, Sherringham and King\\'s Lynn. On this expedition there were two Zeppelins. They reached the coast of Norfolk about 8.30 in the evening and then steered northwest across the country toward King\\'s Lynn, dropping bombs as they went. In these towns there were no military stations and the damage suffered was very slight. Nine persons were killed, all civilians. This raid was followed by many others, which at first usually wasted their ammunition, dropping their bombs on small country towns or in empty fields.  On the 31st of May an expedition reached London and killed six persons in the east end. The result of this raid was to stir the English to intense indignation. Mobs gathered in the London streets, and persons suspected of being Germans, or with German sympathies, were attacked. Other raids followed, none of them doing serious military damage, but usually killing or wounding innocent non-combatants. The stupid policy of secrecy which they maintained during the first year of the war unfortunately permitted great exaggeration of the real damages which they had suffered.  During the first year, according to Mr. Balfour, in eighteen Zeppelin raids there were only seventy-one civilian adults and eighteen children killed, one hundred and eighty-nine civilian adults and thirty-one children wounded. No soldier or sailor was killed and only seven wounded.  In France similar attacks had been made on Paris and Calais. On the 20th of March two Zeppelins dropped bombs on Paris, but Paris, unlike London, was a fortified city, and the sky soldiers were driven off by the anti-aircraft guns. The French also devised an efficient method of defense. On the appearance of an airship great searchlights flashed into the air and the enemy was made at once a target, not only for the guns of all the forts, but also for airplane attack. In order to attack successfully a Zeppelin it was necessary that an airplane should attain a position above the enemy. For an airplane to rise to such a height time was required, as the airplane rises slowly. The French, therefore, devised a scheme by which two or more airplanes were kept constantly circling at a very great height above the city. Relays were formed which relieved each other at regular intervals. When an airship approached it would therefore be compelled in the first place to pass through the fire of the guns on the great forts, and then would find in the air above airplanes in waiting. The Germans, therefore, practically gave up attacks upon Paris. They were dangerous.  London, practically unarmed, seemed to them an easy mark. But the British Lion was now awake. The English had been taken by surprise. They attempted at first, in an unorganized way, to protect their city, and, though occasionally successful in destroying an airship through the gallantry of some individual hero, they soon found that their defense must be organized, and Admiral Sir Percy Scott was entrusted with the task. Lights were extinguished on the streets and screened on the water front. Illumination for advertising purposes was forbidden; windows were covered, so that London became at night a mass of gloom. The Zeppelins, compelled to fly at a very great height, because of anti-aircraft guns, were blinded. As in Paris airplanes were constantly kept on the alert and searchlights and anti-airship guns placed at every convenient point.  The suggestion was made that the English should undertake reprisals, but the suggestion was strongly opposed on the ground that the British should not be a \"party to a line of conduct condemned by every right-thinking man of every civilized nation.\"  The effect of the English improved defenses was soon obvious, when the German expeditions began to lose airship after airship. Under the new regime, when such an attack was signaled, the whole city immediately received warning and the sky was swept by dozens of searchlights. Safe retreats were ready for those who cared to use them, but ordinarily the whole population rushed out to watch the spectacle. Airplanes would dash at the incoming foe; the searchlights would be switched off and the guns be silent to avoid hindering the aviators. Then would come the attack and Zeppelin after Zeppelin would be seen falling, a great mass of flames, while their companions would hurry back across the Channel. Even there they would not be safe, for many an airship was brought down on English fields, or on the waters of the sea.  The Germans, however, did not confine their policy of frightfulness in the air to the performances of their Zeppelins. Before the Zeppelins had crossed the Channel their airplanes had visited England. On Christmas Day, 1914, an airplane attacked Dover, doing, however, no damage. Other airplanes also visited the British Isles from time to time, dropping bombs, and as the Germans began to lose faith in the efficacy of their Zeppelin fleets they began more and more to substitute airplanes for their airships.  On some of these expeditions much more damage was done than had ever been done by the Zeppelins. The airplane expedition grew serious in the year 1917; between May 23d and June 16th of that year there were five such aerial attacks. The airplanes could not only move with greater speed but with better direction. An attack on May 25th resulted in the killing of seventy-six persons and the injuring of one hundred and seventy-four, the principal victims being women and children. This was at the town of Folkestone on the southeast coast. In this attack there were about sixteen airplanes, and the time of the attack was not more than three minutes. Scarcely any part of Folkestone escaped injury. The attack was methodically organized. Four separate squadrons passed over the city, following each other at short intervals. It was impossible to tell when the attack would end, and people in shelters or cellars were kept waiting for hours without being able to feel certain that the danger had passed.   [Illustration: Photograph]   AN AIRPLANE ALARM   Sailors dashing to the fighting tops of a battleship and putting an   anti-aircraft gun in action to repel a hostile airplane.   [Illustration: Painting]   LONDON\\'S WELCOME TO A ZEPPELIN RAIDER   In the early part of the war Zeppelin raids on England were frequent.   The rapid perfecting of searchlights, anti-aircraft guns and airplane   defenses soon discouraged them. This picture shows an airplane about   to attack with flaming bullets.   [Illustration: Photograph]   GUARDING PARIS FROM THE HUN   Observation post fitted with instruments for gauging the height and   speed of enemy aircraft, a giant searchlight, a listening post and a   \"75\" gun installed on the outskirts of Paris.   It is probable that one of the motives of these raids was to keep at home fleets of English airplanes which might be more useful on the front. Indeed, many Englishmen, alarmed by the damage, urged such a policy, but the good sense of the English leaders prevented such a mistake from being made. Pitiful as must have been the suffering in individual cases, the whole of the damage caused by the German frightfulness was but a trifle as compared with the usefulness of the English air-fleets when directly sent against the German armies. Nevertheless, every squadron of German airplanes sent to England was attacked by British aviators, and in those attacks the Germans suffered many losses.   [Illustration: Map]   THE FIRST GERMAN ARMY WHICH INVADED FRANCE (1,200,000) WOULD HAVE   STRETCHED FROM PARIS INTO RUSSIA (1,200 MILES) IF MARCHING IN SINGLE   FILE  The worst raid of all those made was one on June 13th, which was directed upon the city of London. On that occasion ninety-seven persons were killed and four hundred and thirty-seven wounded. These airplane operations differed from the Zeppelin expeditions in being carried on in the daytime, and this raid took place while the schools were in session and large numbers of people were in the street. Only one of the attacking airplanes was brought down. The raiding machines were of a new type, about three times the size of the ordinary machine, and there were twenty-two such machines in the squadron. The battle in the air was a striking spectacle and in spite of the danger was watched by millions of the population. The raiders were easily seen and their flight seemed like a flight of swallows as they dived and swerved through the air.  The raids on England were not the only raids conducted by the Germans during the war. Paris suffered, but as soon as the warning sounded, the sky over the city was alive with defense airplanes. An attack on the French capital took place on the 27th of July and began about midnight. The German airmen, however, never got further than a suburban section of the city, and their bombardment caused but little damage. In one of the suburbs, however, a German flyer dropped four bombs on a Red Cross Hospital, killing two doctors, a chemist and a male nurse, and injuring a number of patients. The raider was flying low and the distinguishing marks of the hospital were plainly apparent.  Almost every day during the bitter fighting of 1918, reports came in that Allied hospitals had been bombed by German raiders. Attacks on hospitals were, of course, strictly forbidden by the Hague Convention, and they caused bitter indignation. Such attacks were of a piece with those upon hospital ships which were made from time to time. From the very beginning of the war the Germans could not understand the psychology of the people of the Allied countries. They were not fighting with slaves, ready to cower under the lash, but with free people, ready to fight for liberty and roused to fury by lawlessness.    CHAPTER XXX  RED REVOLUTION IN RUSSIA  The Russian Revolution was not a sudden movement of the people. Long before the war it had raised its head. The Duma itself came into existence as one of its fruits; but when the war began all parties joined in patriotic support of the Russian armies and laid aside for the time their cherished grievances. The war was immensely popular. Slavonic nationalism turned against Austria-Hungary and Germany who were bent upon crushing the Slavonic sister state, Serbia. The Liberal elements saw in Germany the stronghold of reaction and of militarism, and trusted that its downfall would be followed by that of Russian autocracy. But so glaring was the incapacity of the old regime, that a union was formed during the war by all the Liberal parties. This group united on the single aim of pushing on the war, and silently preparing for the moment when the catastrophe to Czarism was to come.  This was long before the revolution. But a conviction of the necessity of immediate change gradually came to all. The Czar himself brought matters to an issue. His vacillation, his appointment of ministers who were not only reactionary, but were suspected of being German tools, were too much for even honest supporters of the Imperial regime. Some of these reactionaries, it is true, were easily driven from power. In 1915 Sukhomlinov and Maklakov were overthrown by the influence of the army and the Duma. But in 1916 the parasites came to life again. M. Boris Stuermer became Prime Minister, and appointed as Minister of the Interior the notorious Protopopov. On November 14, 1916, Miliukov, the leader of the Constitutional Democrats, or Cadet Party, attacked the Premier in one of the fiercest speeches ever made in the Russian Duma. Stuermer was compelled to resign, but his successor, M. Trepov, though an honest man with high ambitions, was forced to retain Protopopov at the Interior. For a moment there was calm. But it was the calm before the storm.  The Russian Revolution, now recognized as the most bloody revolution in history, began with the assassination of a single man. This man was Gregory Novikh, known throughout the world under the name of Rasputin. A Siberian peasant by birth, immoral, filthy in person, untrained in mind, he had early received the nickname of Rasputin, which means \"ne\\'er-do-well,\" on account of his habits. A drunkard, and a libertine always, he posed as a sort of saint and miracle worker, let his hair grow long, and tramped about the world barefoot.  Rasputin had left his district of Tobolsk and at Moscow had started a new cult, where mystical seances were mingled with debauchery. Through Madame Verubova he had been introduced to the Empress herself. He became the friend of Count Witte, of Stuermer, and Protopopov was his tool. Rumor credited him with exercising an extraordinary influence upon the Czarina, and through her upon the Czar. This influence was thought to be responsible for many of the Czar\\'s unpopular policies. In times of great public agitation the wildest rumors are easily taken for truth and the absurd legends which were easily associated with his name were greedily accepted by people of every rank. The influence of Rasputin over the Imperial family was denied again and again. It has been said from authoritative sources that the Czar did not know him by sight, and that the Czarina knew him only as a superstitious and neurotic woman might know some fortune teller or other charlatan. Nevertheless the credulous public believed him to be the evil spirit of the Imperial circle, and every false move, every unpopular act, was ascribed to his baneful influence. But such a career could not last long, and the end became a tragedy.  Several times Rasputin had been attacked, but had escaped. At last, on the 29th of December, 1916, Prince Yusapov, a young man of wealth and position, invited him to dine with him at his own home. The Prince came for him in his own car. Entering the dining-room, they found there the Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovitch. M. Purishkevitch, a member of the Duma, had acted as chauffeur, and he followed him in. The three told him that he was to die and he was handed a pistol that he might kill himself; instead of doing so, he shot at the Grand Duke, but missed, and then was shot in turn by his captors. The noise attracted the attention of the police who inquired what had happened. \"I have just killed a dog,\" was the reply.  His body was taken in an automobile to the Neva River, a hole cut in the ice, and weighted with stones, it was dropped into the waters. On the next day his executioners notified the police of what they had done, and the news was announced at the Imperial Theatre, whose audience went wild with enthusiasm, and sang the National Hymn. No legal action was ever taken against Rasputin\\'s executioners. His body was recovered and given honorable burial. The Czarina, according to report, following the coffin to the grave. And so disappeared from the Imperial Court one evil force.  But his tool, Alexander Protopopov, still survived. Protopopov was an extraordinary man. In 1916 he had visited England and France and made a splendid impression. His speeches, full of fire and patriotism, were regarded as the best made by any deputation that had come from Russia. But on his return to Petrograd he fell completely into the hands of the Court party. He became associated with Rasputin, and his wild talk and restless conduct suggested to many that his mind had become affected.  After the death of Rasputin, the meeting of the Duma, which should have taken place on January 25, 1917, was postponed for a month. The censorship was drawn tighter, the members of the secret police were greatly increased, and a deliberate endeavor, under the direction of Protopopov was made to encourage an abortive revolution, so that its overthrow might establish the reactionaries in power. But the attempt failed.  During January and February the people were calm. No one wanted revolution then. On February 9th, the labor members of the War Industry Committee were arrested. This was regarded as plainly provocative, and M. Miliukov wrote appeals to the people for patience. These were suppressed, but no disturbance ensued. A British Commission, then on a visit to Russia, reported that there was no danger of revolution. But the people were hungry. Speakers in the Duma discussed the food problem. It became harder and harder to procure bread, and little that was practical seemed to be done to improve the situation, though in some parts of the country there were large surplus stocks. On March 8th crowds gathered around the bakery shops, and looted several of them. The next day the crowds in the streets increased. Groups of Cossacks rode here and there, fraternizing with the people. They, too, were hungry. In the afternoon two workmen were arrested for disorder by the police. A band of Cossacks freed them. Street speakers began to appear here and there, and crowds gathered to listen to their fiery denunciations of the government.  On March 11th, General Khabalov, military governor of the city, issued a proclamation announcing that the police had orders to disperse all crowds, and that any workman who did not return to work on Monday morning would be sent to the trenches. The main streets of the city were cleared and guarded by the police and soldiery. The crowds were enormous, and disorderly, and more than two hundred of the rioters were killed. Yet it seemed as if the government had the situation in a firm grasp, though an ominous incident was that the Pavlovsk regiment on being ordered to fire upon the mob, mutinied and had to be ordered to their quarters.  Meantime Rodzianko, the President of the Duma, had telegraphed to the Czar:   Situation serious. Anarchy reigns in Capital. Government is paralyzed. Transport food and fuel supplies are utterly disorganized. General discontent is growing. Disorderly firing is going on in streets. Various companies of soldiers are shooting at each other. It is absolutely necessary to invest someone, who enjoys the confidence of the people, with powers to form a new government. No time must be lost, and delay may be fatal. I pray to God that in this hour responsibility may not fall on the wearer of the crown.   The Prime Minister, Prince Golitzin, acting under powers which he had received from the Czar, prorogued the Duma. But the Duma refused to be prorogued. Its President, Rodzianko, holding in his hand the order for dissolution, announced that the Duma was now the sole constitutional authority of Russia.  During the night following, the soldiers at the Capital, and the Socialists, decided upon their course. The soldiers determined that they would not fire upon their civilian brothers. The Socialists planned an alternative scheme of government.  On March the 12th, the city was taken possession of by a mob. The Preo Crajenski Guards refused to fire upon the crowd. The Volynsky regiment, sent to coerce them, joined in the mutiny. Followed by the mob, the two regiments seized the arsenal. A force of 25,000 soldiers was in the revolt. At 11 A. M., the Courts of Law were set on fire and the fortress of SS. Peter and Paul was seized. The police, fighting desperately, were hunted from their quarters, their papers destroyed and the prisoners, political and criminal, released from the jails.  During the day the Duma kept in constant session, awaiting the Emperor, who did not come. Telegram after telegram was sent him, each more urgent. There is reason to believe that these telegrams never reached the Czar. When information finally did come to him it was too late. Meantime the Duma appointed an executive committee. Their names were Rodzianko, Nekrasov, Konovalov, Dmitrikov, Lvov, Rjenski, Karaulov, Miliukov, Schledlovski, Schulgin, Tcheidze and Kerensky. The workmen and soldiers also formed a committee, which undertook to influence the troops now pouring into Petrograd. But the center of the revolution was still the Duma, and crowds gathered to listen to its speeches. In the evening Protopovo surrendered to the Russian guards, but General Khabalov still occupied the Admiralty building with such forces as were faithful.  On March 13th it became evident that the army in the field were accepting the authority of the provisional government. The Duma committee was composed mainly of men of moderate political views. They moved slowly, fearing on the one hand the Reactionaries who still preserved their loyalty to the Czar, and on the other hand the Council of Labor, with its extreme views, and its influence--with the troops. The siege of the Admiralty building was ended by the surrender of General Khabalov. The police, however, were still keeping up a desultory resistance, but the mob were hunting them like wild beasts. On Wednesday, the 14th of March, the revolution was over.  The Executive Committee of the Duma and the Council of the Workmen\\'s and Soldiers\\' Delegates, now universally known as the Soviet, were working in harmony. Every hour proclamations were issued, some of them foolish, some of them, it is thought, inspired by German agents, and some of them wise and patriotic. One of the most unfortunate of these proclamations was one to the army directing that \"the orders of the War Committee must be obeyed, saving only on those occasions when they shall contravene the orders and regulations of the labor deputies and military delegates.\" This same proclamation abolished saluting for private soldiers off duty. It was the beginning of the destruction of the Russian military power. The proclamation of the Duma committee itself was admirable:   CITIZENS: The Provisional Executive Committee of the Duma, with the aid and support of the garrison of the capital and its inhabitants, has now triumphed over the baneful forces of the old regime in such a manner as to enable it to proceed to the more stable organization of the executive power. With this object, the Provisional Committee will name ministers of the first national cabinet, men whose past public activity assures them the confidence of the country.  The new cabinet will adopt the following principles as the basis of its policy:  1. An immediate amnesty for all political and religious offenses, including military revolts, acts of terrorism, and agrarian crimes.  2. Freedom of speech, of the press, of associations and labor organizations, and the freedom to strike; with an extension of these liberties to officials and troops, in so far as military and technical conditions permit.  3. The abolition of social, religious, and racial restrictions and privileges.  4. Immediate preparation for the summoning of a Constituent Assembly, which, with universal suffrage as a basis, shall establish the governmental regime and the constitution of the country.  5. The substitution for the police of a national militia, with elective heads and subject to the self-governing bodies.  6. Communal elections to be carried out on the basis of universal suffrage.  7. The troops that have taken part in the revolutionary movement shall not be disarmed, but they are not to leave Petrograd.  8. While strict military discipline must be maintained on active service, all restrictions upon soldiers in the enjoyment of social rights granted to other citizens are to be abolished.   Meantime the Emperor, \"the Little Father,\" at first thoroughly incredulous of the gravity of the situation, had at last become alarmed. He appointed General Ivanov Commander-in-Chief of the army, and ordered him to proceed to Petrograd at the head of a division of loyal troops. General Ivanov set out, but his train was held up at Tsarkoe Selo, and he returned to Pskov. The Czar himself then started for the city, but he, too, was held up at the little station of Bologoi, where workmen had pulled up the track, and he returned to Pskov.  He sent for Ruzsky and declared that he was ready to yield to the Duma and grant a responsible ministry. Ruzsky advised him to get in touch with Rodzianko, and as a result of a telephone communication with Rodzianko and with several of his trusted generals, it became clear that there was no other course than abdication. Guchkov and Shulgin, messengers from the Duma, arrived on the evening of March 15th, and found the Emperor alone, except for his aide-de-camp, Count Fredericks.  \"What do you want me to do?\" he asked.  \"You must abdicate,\" Guchkov told him, \"in favor of your son, with the Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovitch as Regent.\"  The Emperor sat for a long time silent. \"I cannot be separated from my boy,\" he said. \"I will hand the throne to my brother.\" Taking a sheet of paper he wrote as follows:   By the Grace of God, We, Nicholas II, Emperor of all the Russias, to all our faithful subjects:  In the course of a great struggle against a foreign enemy, who has been endeavoring for three years to enslave our country, it has pleased God to send Russia a further bitter trial. Internal troubles have threatened to compromise the progress of the war. The destinies of Russia, the honor of her heroic army, the happiness of her people, and the whole future of our beloved country demand that at all costs victory shall be won. The enemy is making his last efforts, and the moment is near when our gallant troops, in concert with their glorious Allies, will finally overthrow him.  In these days of crisis we have considered that our nation needs the closest union of all its forces for the attainment of victory. In agreement with the Imperial Duma, we have recognized that for the good of our land we should abdicate the throne of the Russian state and lay down the supreme power.  Not wishing to separate ourselves from our beloved son, we bequeath our heritage to our brother, the Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovitch, with our blessing upon the future of the Russian throne. We bequeath it to him with the charge to govern in full unison with the national representatives who may sit in the legislature, and to take his inviolable oath to them in the name of our well-beloved country.  We call upon all faithful sons of our land to fulfil this sacred and patriotic duty in obeying their Emperor at this painful moment of national trial, and to aid him, together with the representatives of the nation, to lead the Russian people in the way of prosperity and glory.  May God help Russia.   So ended the reign of Nicholas the Second, Czar of all the Russias. The news of the Czar\\'s abdication spread over the world with great rapidity, and was received by the Allies with mixed feelings. The Czar had been scrupulously loyal to the alliance. He was a man of high personal character, and his sympathies on the whole, liberal; but he was a weak man in a position in which even a strong man might have failed. He was easily influenced, especially by his wife. Warned again and again of the danger before him, he constantly promised improvement, only to fail in keeping his promises. He deeply loved his wife, and yielded continually to her unwise advice.  The Empress Alexandra Feodorovna is but another instance of a devoted queen who dethroned her consort. She believed in Divine Right and looked with suspicion upon popular leaders. Her one object in life was to hand on the Russian crown to her son, with no atom of its power diminished. She surrounded herself and her husband with scoundrels and charlatans.  On the whole, the feeling among the Allies was one of relief. There was a general distrust of the influences which had been surrounding the Czar. The patriotism of the Grand Duke Michael was well known, and a government conducted by him was sure to be a great improvement. But it was not to be. Before the news of the abdication reached Petrograd a new ministry had been formed by the Duma. Miliukov announced their names and explained their credentials. The Prime Minister was Prince George Lvov. Miliukov was Minister of Foreign Affairs, Guchkov Minister of War and Marine, Kerensky, a new name in the government, Minister of Justice. The ministry included representatives of every party of the left and center.  Miliukov declared that their credentials came from the Russian revolution: \"We shall not fight for the sake of power. To be in power is not a reward or pleasure but a sacrifice. As soon as we are told that the sacrifice is no longer needed, we shall give up our places with gratitude for the opportunity which has been accorded us.\"  He concluded by informing his hearers that the despot who had brought Russia to the brink of ruin would either abdicate of his free will, or be deposed. He added that the Grand Duke Michael would be appointed Regent.  This announcement at once produced an explosion. A ministry of moderates and a continuance of the Imperial government under a regency stirred the delegates of the workmen and soldiers to revolt. For a time it seemed as if the new government would disappear in the horrors of mob rule. But Kerensky saved the situation. Making his way into the meeting of the Soviet he burst into an impassioned speech.  \"Comrades!\" he cried, \"I have been appointed Minister of Justice. No one is a more ardent Republican than I, but we must bide our time. Nothing can come to its full growth at once. We shall have our Republic but we must first win the war. The need of the moment is organization and discipline and that need will not wait.\"  His eloquence carried the day. The Soviet passed a resolution supporting the provisional government with only fifteen dissenting votes. But it had been made clear that the people did not approve of the regency, and on the night of the 15th of March, Prince Lvov, Kerensky and other leaders of the Duma sought out the Grand Duke Michael and informed him of the situation. The Grand Duke yielded to the people, and on Friday, March the 16th, issued a declaration which ended the power of the Romanovs in Russia:   I am firmly resolved to accept the supreme power only if this should be the desire of our great people, who must, by means of a plebiscite through their representatives in the Constituent Assembly, establish the form of government and the new fundamental laws of the Russian state. Invoking God\\'s blessing, I, therefore, request all citizens of Russia to obey the provisional government, set up on the initiative of the Duma, and invested with plenary powers, until within as short a time as possible the Constituent Assembly elected on a basis of equal, universal and secret suffrage, shall enforce the will of the nation regarding the future form of the constitution.   With this declaration the sacred monarchy had disappeared. In one week the people had come to their own and Russia was free. But what form of new government was to replace the old regime was still the question. There were two rival theories as to the principles to be followed, one that of the Moderates, the other of the Extremists. The Moderates, who controlled the provisional government were practical men. They realized that Russia was at war and that efficient administration was the great need.  The Extremists of the Soviet were a different type of men. They were profoundly ignorant of all practical questions of government; their creed was socialism. The Socialistic party in Russia may be divided into three different groups. The first, the Social Revolutionary party, came into prominence in Russia about 1900. It was composed of followers of the Russian Lavrov who believed in the socialist state, but a state which should not be a tyrant overriding the individual. Liberty was his watchword and he made his appeal not only to the workmen in the shops but with a special force to the peasant. He did not preach class war in the ordinary sense, and believed in the value of national life. To this party belonged Kerensky, more and more becoming the leader of the revolutionary movement.  The second group of the Socialist party were the Bolsheviki. This group were followers of the German Karl Marx. The revolution which they sought was essentially a class revolution. To the Bolsheviki the fate of their country mattered not at all. They were eager for peace on any terms. The only war in which they were interested was a class war; they recognized no political boundaries. The leader of this group was Vladimir Iljetch Uljanov, who, under his pen name of Lenine, was already widely known and who had now obtained the opportunity which he had long desired.  The third group were the Mensheviki. The Mensheviki believed in the importance of the working classes, but they did not ignore other classes. They were willing to use existing forms of government to carry out the reforms they desired. They saw that the Allied cause was their own cause, the cause of the workman as well as the intellectual.  The Soviet contained representatives of these three groups. It did not represent Russia, but it was in Petrograd and could exert its influence directly upon the government.  The attitude of the provisional government toward the Imperial family was at first not unkindly. The Czar and the Czarina were escorted to the Alexandrovsky Palace in Tsarskoe-Selo. The Czar for a time lived quietly as plain Nicholas Romanov. The Czarina and her children were very ill with measles, the case of the little Prince being complicated by the breaking out of an old wound in his foot. The Grand Duchess Tatiana was in a serious condition and oxygen had been administered. As his family improved in health the Czar amused himself by strolls in the palace yard, and even by shoveling snow. Later on Nicholas was transferred to Tobolsk, Siberia, and then, in May, 1918, to Yekaterinberg. His wife and his daughter Marie accompanied him to the latter place, while Alexis and his other three daughters remained in Tobolsk. On July 20th a Russian government dispatch announced his assassination. It read as follows:   At the first session of the Central Executive Committee, elected by the Fifth Congress of the Councils, a message was made public that had been received by direct wire from the Ural Regional Council, concerning the shooting of the ex-Czar, Nicholas Romanov. Recently Yekaterinberg, the Capital of the Red Urals, was seriously threatened by the approach of Czecho-Slovak bands, and a counter-revolutionary conspiracy was discovered, which had as its object the wresting of the ex-Czar from the hands of the Council\\'s authority. In view of this fact the President of the Ural Regional Council decided to shoot the ex-Czar, and the decision was carried out on July 16th.   The wife and the son of Nicholas Romanov had been sent to a place of security. In a detailed account of the execution, published in Berlin, it appeared that the Czar had been awakened at five o\\'clock in the morning, and informed that he was to be executed in two hours. He spent some time with a priest in his bedroom and wrote several letters. According to this account, when the patrol came to take him out for execution he was found in a state of collapse. His last words, uttered just before the executioners fired, are reported to have been \"Spare my wife and my innocent and unhappy children. May my blood preserve Russia from ruin.\"  The Russian press, including the Socialist papers, condemned the execution as a cruel and unnecessary act. The charges of conspiracy were utterly unproven, and were merely an excuse. The Central Executive Committee, however, accepted the decision of the Ural Regional Soviet as being regular, and a decree by the Bolshevist Government declared all the property of the former Emperor, his wife, his mother and all the members of the Imperial house, forfeit to the Soviet Republic.  Meantime the provisional government, which had taken power on the 16th of March, seemed as if it might succeed. Miliukov, whose announcement of the Regency had made him unpopular, declared for a Republic. The great army commanders for the most part accepted the revolution. The Grand Duke Nicholas was removed from his command and the other Grand Dukes were ordered not to leave Petrograd. Alexiev became commander-in-chief; Ruzsky had the northern group of armies, Brusilov the southern; Kornilov was in command of Petrograd, and the central group was put under the command of Lechitsky. Reports came that discipline was improving everywhere on the front.   [Illustration: Map of Petrograd]   CAPITAL OF THE NEW REPUBLIC OF RUSSIA   The plans of the government, too, met with general approval. Their policy was announced by Prince Lvov. \"The new government considers it its duty to make known to the world that the object of free Russia is not to dominate other nations and forcibly to take away their territory. The object of independent Russia is a permanent peace and the right of all nations to determine their own destiny.\"  Kerensky, in inspiring speeches, encouraged the country to war, and declared against a separate peace. The new government announced that Poland was to receive complete independence, with a right to determine its own form of government, and its relation, if any, to Russia. In Finland the Governor, Sein, was removed. A Liberal was appointed Governor and the Finnish Diet was convened. A manifesto was issued on March 21st, completely restoring the Finnish constitution. To the Armenians Kerensky expressed himself as in favor of an autonomous government for them, under Russia\\'s protection, and on March 25th, absolute equality of the Jews was proclaimed by the new government. A number of Jews were made officers in the army, and two Jewish advocates were appointed members of the Russian Senate and of the Supreme Court. On April 4th full religious liberty was proclaimed, and on the same date the Prime Minister promised a delegation of women that women would be given the right to vote.  These acts caused a general subsidence of unrest, and public good feeling was increased by the return of the political exiles and prisoners from Siberia. A full hundred thousand of such prisoners were released, and their progress across Siberia to Russia was one grand triumphal march.  The most celebrated of these political prisoners were two women, Catherine Breshkovskaya and Marie Spiridonova. Catherine Breshkovskaya was known as the grandmother of the revolution. Forty-four years of her life were spent in exile. When she reached Petrograd she was met at the railroad depot by a military band, and carried in procession through the streets. Equally popular was Marie Spiridonova, who, though still young, had suffered martyrdom. She had been tortured with cruelty that is unprintable. Her face had been disfigured for life. The agents who had inflicted the torture were assassinated by the revolutionists.  It was a great day for Russia, and the outlook seemed full of promise.    CHAPTER XXXI  THE DESCENT TO BOLSHEVISM  The hopes entertained for the new Republic of Russia were doomed to disappointment. For a short time, under the leadership of Lvov, the Russians marched along the path of true democracy. But the pace became too rapid.  The government prospered in Petrograd, and the economic organization of the country proceeded with great speed. An eight-hour day was introduced in the capital and in many other cities throughout the republic. The fever of organization spread even to the peasants. They formed a Council of Peasants\\' Deputies, modeled after the Council of Workmen and Soldiers. On the 13th of April, 1917, came the first meeting of the All-Russia Congress of Soviets, and with it a revival of the differences of opinion which ultimately were to destroy the government. The great majority were for war, but the minority, led by Lenine and the Bolsheviki element, demanded an immediate peace. They declared that the enemies of the Revolution were not the Central Powers; but the capitalists in all countries, and not least the Provisional Government of Russia.  Some clew to the meaning of the Bolsheviki movement in Russia is to be found in the life of Lenine, its leading spirit. It has been charged that he was the tool of the German Government. He undoubtedly received facilities from the German Government to return to Russia from Switzerland immediately after the Revolution in March. His whole career, however, suggests that he was not a tool, but a fanatic.  He was born in Simbirsk, in Central Russia, in the year 1870. Lenine was only one of the several aliases that he had found it necessary to adopt at various times. He was of good family, and received his education at the Petrograd University. From the very beginning he took an active interest in the political and social problems of the day. In 1887 his brother, A. Uljanov, was arrested, and after a secret trial condemned to death and hanged as a participant in a plot to wreck the imperial train carrying Alexander III. Lenine was also arrested, but was released on account of a lack of evidence. At this time the Russian Socialistic movement was still in its infancy.

This   shows a soldier examining an abandoned German machine-gun, fully   loaded and not a shot fired.   [Illustration: Photograph]   AN AERIAL BOMB   British airmen examining a huge bomb which later scattered death among   the Huns.   Lenine spent his Sundays in a circle of uneducated workmen, explaining to them the elements of socialistic economics. Along with this propaganda work he studied deeply the economic phases of Russian life, being especially interested in its working and peasant classes. He wrote several books on the subject, which are still accepted as valuable representatives of Russian economic literature. Because of his socialistic activities, Lenine was compelled to leave Russia on several occasions, when he lived in Switzerland, France and Austria. From these countries he directed the work of one of the groups of the Social Democratic party, and became an important leader.  In the General Russian Socialistic Convention, held in 1903, this group made a definite stand for its program and policies. This was the time when the word \"Bolsheviki\" was coined, meaning the \"majority,\" who had voted in accord with Lenine\\'s proposals. Lenine believed in the seizure of political power by means of violent revolution and in establishing a proletarian government. After the Revolution of 1905, the Lenine faction dwindled and it seemed as if Bolshevism was destined to die out. But in 1911, with the awakening of a new spirit in the political and social life of Russia, a new impetus was given to the activities of the Bolsheviki. The first Socialist daily paper, Pravda, (\"the Truth,\") was one of their efforts. In 1913 the Bolsheviki sent six representatives to the Duma.  At the outbreak of the war Lenine was in Cracow. Like other revolutionary leaders he was compelled to live in exile. He went to Switzerland where he remained until the news of the successful revolution caused his return to Russia. On his arrival in Petrograd he gathered together his followers and began the agitation in favor of the Bolshevist program and of peace.  The first sign of the conflict between the Provisional Government and the Soviet arose in connection with the joint note sent to the Allies by the Provisional Government on May 1st. This note was signed by Foreign Secretary Miliukov. It declared, among other things, that the Provisional Government would \"maintain a strict regard for its engagements with the Allies of Russia.\"  The document aroused strong disapproval among many members of the Council of the Soviet, and serious anti-government demonstrations occurred in Petrograd on May 3d and 4th. These demonstrations were directed distinctly against Miliukov. Detachments of soldiers and workmen gathered in front of the headquarters of the Provisional Government, carrying banners, with inscriptions \"Down with Miliukov! Down with the Provisional Government!\" Miliukov appealed to the crowd for confidence, and his words were greeted with hearty cheering.  The Soviet Council ultimately voted confidence in the government by a narrow margin of 35 in a total of 2,500. But the agitation against the government persisted, and on May 16th Miliukov resigned. General Kornilov, Commander of the Petrograd Garrison, and Guchkov, Minister of War, finding their control of the army weakened by the interference of the Soviet Council, also resigned.  The situation became critical. As a result of this agitation a new coalition government was formed. Prince Lvov remained Prime Minister. Terestchenko became Foreign Minister. Most significant of all, Kerensky became the Minister of War. The new government issued a new declaration of policy, promising a firm support of the war with Germany, and an effort to call together at the earliest possible date a Constituent Assembly to deal with questions of land and of finance. This manifesto was received coldly by the Soviets and their press.  It was at this time that the Allies sent special missions to Russia to aid the Russian Government in forwarding the fight against the common enemy. The American mission to Russia was headed by Elihu Root, former Secretary of State. It was cordially received, and housed in the former Winter Palace of the Czar. On June 15th the American Ambassador, David R. Francis, presented the Root mission to the Council of Ministers in the Marinsky Palace, and Mr. Root made an eloquent address, declaring the sympathy of the American Republic with the new Russian Democracy. He declared that the liberty of both nations was in danger. \"The armed forces of military autocracy are at the gates of Russia and the Allies. The triumph of Germans will mean the death of liberty in Russia. No enemy is at the gates of America, but America has come to realize that the triumph of German arms means the death of Liberty in the world.\"  At Moscow Mr. Root addressed representatives of the Zemstvo and the local Council of the Workmen and Soldiers. He was warmly applauded, and on motion of the Mayor a telegram was sent to President Wilson, thanking him for sending the Root Commission to Russia. The Root Mission returned to the United States early in August, and reported to Washington August 12th. At a public reception given by the citizens of New York, Senator Root expressed supreme confidence in the stability of the Revolution.  On July 1st, inspired by Kerensky, and under the personal leadership of General Kornilov, the Russian army began an offensive in Galicia. It first met with complete success, capturing Halicz, and sweeping forward close to Dolina in the Carpathian foothills. Then under a very slight hostile German pressure, the Russian armies, immediately to the north and south of Kornilov\\'s army, broke and ran. This action was directly traced to orders subversive of discipline, emanating from the Petrograd Soviet. Kornilov\\'s army was compelled to retire, and by July 21st was in full retreat from Galicia.  The Russian mutiny spread. Regiments refused to fight or to obey their officers.  One of the most picturesque episodes of this phase of the war was the formation of a woman\\'s regiment, known as the \"Command of Death,\" which was reviewed at Petrograd June 21st, by Minister of War, Kerensky. In front of the barracks assigned to this regiment a visitor found posted at the gate a little blue-eyed sentry in a soldier\\'s khaki blouse, short breeches, green forage cap, ordinary woman\\'s black stockings and neat shoes. The sentry was Mareya Skridlov, daughter of Admiral Skridlov, former commander of the Baltic fleet and Minister of Marines. In the courtyard three hundred girls were drilling, mostly between 18 and 25 years old, of good physique and many of them pretty. They wore their hair short or had their heads entirely shaved. They were drilling under the instruction of a male sergeant of the Volynsky regiment, and marched to an exaggerated goose step.  The girl commander, Lieutenant Buitchkarev, explained that most of the recruits were from the higher educational academies, with a few peasants, factory girls and servants. Some married women were accepted, but none who had children. The Battalion of Death distinguished itself on the field, setting an example of courage to the mutinous regiments during the retreat of Brusilov.  With the army thus demoralized the Russian Revolution encountered a perilous period toward the end of July, 1917, and civil war or anarchy seemed almost at hand, when out of the depths of the national spirit there arose a new revolution to save the situation and to maintain order. The country was everywhere the scene of riotous disturbances. Anarchists, radicals, and monarchists seemed to be working hand-in-hand to precipitate a reign of terror, when once more Kerensky saved the situation. On July 20th, it was announced that the Premier, Prince Lvov, had resigned, and that Alexander Kerensky had been appointed Premier, but would also retain his portfolio as Minister of War.  A new government was quickly formed. Kerensky was made practical Dictator, and his government received the complete endorsement of a joint Congress of the Soviets and the Council of peasant delegates. Kerensky acted with the utmost vigor. Orders were given to fire on deserters and warrants issued for the arrest of revolutionary agitators whoever they might be. Rear-Admiral Verdervski, commander of the Baltic fleet, was seized for communicating a secret government telegram to sailors\\' committees. Agitators from the Soviet were arrested, charged with inciting the Peterhof troops against the Federal Government. On July 22d, the following resolution was passed by the joint Congress.   Recognizing that the country is menaced by a military debacle on the front and by anarchy at home, it is resolved:  1. That the country and the revolution are in danger.  2. That the Provisional Government is proclaimed the Government of    National Safety.  3. That unlimited powers are accorded the government for re-establishing    the organization and discipline of the army for a fight to a finish    against the enemies of public order, and for the realization of the    whole program embodied in the governmental program just announced.   The reorganization of the Councils of the All-Russia, and Workmen\\'s and Peasants\\' Organizations on the 23d, issued a ringing address to the army denouncing its mutinous spirit and warning it of the inevitable result. The Provisional Government also issued a proclamation on July 22d, charging that the disorders were precipitated to bring about a counter-revolution by the enemies of the country. But the army was demoralized. It disregarded discipline and refused to recognize military rule. A general retreat followed. The Germans and Austrians steadily advanced through Galicia and crossed the frontier before the Russian armies could be forced to make a stand.  The death penalty for treason or mutiny was restored in the army on July 25th, when Kerensky threatened to resign unless this was done. On that same date the government authorized the Minister of the Interior to suspend the publication of periodicals that incite to insubordination or disobedience to orders given by the military authorities. By July 28th the situation had become more hopeful. On that day General Ruzsky, formerly commander-in-chief of the northern armies of Russia, and General Gurko, ex-commander on the Russian southwestern front, were summoned to Petrograd. Each had retired on account of the interference of the Council of Workmen and Soldiers\\' delegates. Their return to the service was a hopeful sign. The Soviet also passed by an overwhelming majority a resolution censuring Lenine, and demanding that he should be publicly tried. Charges had been made that Lenine and his associates were working under German direction and financed by Germans. On August 2d, Kornilov became Commander-in-Chief of the Russian army. A disagreement in the Cabinet led to its reorganization. In the new Cabinet appeared again representatives of the Constitutional Democratic party. Conditions began to show improvement from this time forth.  An extraordinary National Council met at Moscow August 26th, 1917. This conference consisted of 2,500 delegates representing the Duma, the Soviets, the Zemstvos, and indeed all organized Russia. Kerensky opened the conference in a speech of great length in which he reviewed the general situation, declaring that the destructive period of the Revolution had past and that the time had come to consolidate its conquests.  Perhaps the most important address before the Council was that made by General Kornilov, Commander-in-Chief of the army. General Kornilov was received with prolonged cheers, which in the light of his subsequent action were especially significant. General Kornilov described with much detail the disorganization and insubordination in the army, and continued:   \"We are implacably fighting anarchy in the army. Undoubtedly it will finally be repressed, but the danger of fresh debacles is weighing constantly on the country. The situation on the front is bad. We have lost the whole of Galicia, the whole of Bukowina, and all the fruits of our recent victories. If Russia wishes to be saved the army must be regenerated at any cost.\" General Kornilov then outlined the most important of the reform measures which he recommended, and concluded: \"I believe that the genius and the reason of the Russian people will save the country. I believe in a brilliant future for our army. I believe its ancient glory will be restored.\"   General Kaledines, leader of the Don Cossacks, mounted the tribune and read a resolution passed by the Cossacks demanding the continuation of the war until complete victory was attained. He defied the extreme Radicals. \"Who saved you from the Bolsheviki on the 14th of July?\" he asked contemptuously. \"We Cossacks have been free men. We are not made drunk by our new-found liberties and are unblinded by party or program. We tell you plainly and categorically, \\'Remove yourselves from the place which you have neither the ability or the courage to fill, and let better men than yourselves step in, or take the consequences of your folly.\\'\"  The conference took no definite action, being invested with no authority, but it served to bring out clearly the line of cleavage between the Radical or Socialistic element represented by Kerensky and the Conservatives represented by the generals of the army.  Immediately on the heels of the Moscow conference an important German advance was made in the direction of Riga, the most important Russian Baltic port. In spite of a vigorous defense the Germans captured the city.  The loss of Riga intensified the political excitement in Russia, and produced a profound crisis. A wave of unrest spread throughout the country. The Grand Duke Michael, and the Grand Duke Paul with their families, were arrested on a charge of conspiracy. The Provisional Government was charged with responsibility of the collapse of the army.  It was on September 9th, that the storm broke, and General Kornilov, the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian armies, raised the flag of revolt against the Provisional Government. The details of the revolt are as follows:  At one o\\'clock Saturday afternoon, Deputy Lvov, of the Duma, called upon Premier Kerensky, and declared that he had come as the representative of General Kornilov to demand the surrender of all power into Kornilov\\'s hands. M. Lvov said that this demand did not emanate from Kornilov only but was supported by an organization of Duma members, Moscow industrial interests, and other conservatives. This group, said M. Lvov, did not object to Kerensky personally, but demanded that he transfer the Portfolio of War to M. Savinkov, assistant Minister of War, who all along had supported Kornilov.  \"If you agree,\" M. Lvov added, \"we invite you to come to headquarters and meet General Kornilov, giving you a solemn guarantee that you will not be arrested.\"  Premier Kerensky replied that he could not believe Kornilov to be guilty of such an act of treason, and that he would communicate with him directly. In an exchange of telegrams Kornilov confirmed fully to the Premier his demands. Kerensky promptly placed Lvov under arrest, denounced Kornilov as a traitor and deposed him from his position as Commander-in-Chief, General Klembovsky being appointed in his place. General Kornilov responded to the order of dismissal by moving an army against the Capital.  Martial law was declared in Moscow and in Petrograd. Kerensky assumed the functions of Commander-in-Chief and took military measures to defend Petrograd and resist the rebels. On the 12th it was clear that the Kornilov revolt had failed to receive the expected support. Kornilov advanced toward Petrograd, and occupied Jotchina, thirty miles southwest of the Capital, but there was no bloodshed. On the night of the 13th, General Alexief demanded Kornilov\\'s unconditional surrender, and the revolt collapsed. Kornilov was arrested and the Provisional Government reconstituted on stronger lines.  After the so-called Kornilov revolt, the Russian Revolution assumed a form which might almost be called stable. A democratic congress met at Moscow, September 27th, and adopted a resolution providing for a preliminary parliament to consist of 231 members, of whom 110 were to represent the Zemstvos and the towns. The congress refused its sanction to a coalition cabinet in which the Constitutional Democrats should participate, but Kerensky practically defied the congress, and named a coalition cabinet, in which several portfolios were held by members of the Constitutional Democratic Party. The new government issued a statement declaring that it had three principal aims: to raise the fighting power of the army and navy; to bring order to the country by fighting anarchy; to call the Constituent Assembly as soon as possible. The Constituent Assembly was called to assemble in December. It was to consist of 732 delegates to be elected by popular vote.  Meantime agitation against the Coalition Government continued. On November 1st, the Premier issued a statement through the Associated Press, to all the newspapers of the Entente, which conveyed the information that he almost despaired of restoring civil law in the distracted country. He said that he felt that help was needed urgently and that Russia asked it as her right. \"Russia has fought consistently since the beginning,\" he said. \"She saved France and England from disaster early in the war. She is worn out by the strain and claims as her right that the Allies now shoulder the burden.\"  On November 7th, an armed insurrection against the Coalition Government and Premier Kerensky was precipitated by the Bolsheviki faction. The revolt was headed by Leon Trotzky, President of the Central Executive Committee of the Petrograd Council, with Nicholas Lenine, the Bolsheviki leader. The Revolutionists seized the offices of the telephone and telegraph companies and occupied the state bank and the Marie Palace where the preliminary Parliament had been sitting. The garrison at Petrograd espoused the cause of the Bolsheviki and complete control was seized with comparatively little fighting. The government troops were quickly overpowered, except at the Winter Palace, whose chief guardians were the Woman\\'s Battalion, and the Military Cadets. The Woman\\'s Battalion fought bravely, and suffered terribly, and with the Military Cadets who also remained true, held the Palace for several hours. The Bolsheviki brought up armored cars and the cruiser Aurora, and turned the guns of the Fortress of SS. Peter and Paul upon the Palace before its defenders would surrender.  That evening the Revolutionary Committee issued a characteristic proclamation, denouncing the government of Kerensky as opposed to the government and the people, and calling upon the soldiers in the army to arrest their officers if they did not at once join the Revolution. They announced the following program:   First: The offer of an immediate democratic peace.  Second: The immediate handing over of large proportional lands to the peasants.  Third: The transmission of all authority to the Council of Workmen\\'s and Soldiers\\' Delegates.  Fourth: The honest convocation of the Constituent Assembly.   At a meeting of the Council, Trotzky declared that the government no longer existed, and introduced Lenine as an old comrade whom he welcomed back. Lenine was received with prolonged cheers, and said: \"Now we have a Revolution. The peasants and workmen control the government. This is only a preliminary step toward a similar revolution everywhere.\"  Proclamation after proclamation came from the new government. In one of them it was stated \"M. Kerensky has taken flight, and all military bodies have been empowered to take all possible measures to arrest Kerensky and bring him back to Petrograd. All complicity with Kerensky will be dealt with as high treason.\"  A Bolsheviki Cabinet was named. The Premier was Nicholas Lenine; the Foreign Minister, Leon Trotzky. The other Cabinet members were all Bolsheviki, including Bibenko, a Kronstadt sailor, of the Committee on War and Marine, and Shliapnikov, a laborer, who was Minister of Labor. Lenine\\'s personality has already been described. Trotzky, the chief aid of Lenine\\'s rebellion, had been living in New York City three months before the Czar was overthrown, but he had previously been expelled from Germany, France, Switzerland and Spain. His real name was Leber Braunstein, and he was born in the Russian Government of Kherson, near the Black Sea.  When the insurrection occurred, Kerensky succeeded in escaping from Petrograd, and persuaded about two thousand Cossacks, several hundred Military Cadets, and a contingent of Artillery, to fight under his banner. He advanced toward Petrograd, but his forces were greatly outnumbered by the Bolsheviki. At Tsarskoe-Selo a battle took place, the Kerensky troops met defeat, and its leader saved himself by flight.  At Moscow the entire city passed into the control of the Bolsheviki but not without severe fighting in which more than three thousand people were slain. On the collapse of the Kerensky government conditions throughout Russia became chaotic. Ukraine declared its independence, and Finland also severed its connection with Russia. General Kaledines declared against the Bolsheviki, and organized an army to save the country. Siberia, Bessarabia, Lithuania, the Caucasus and other districts declared their complete independence of the Central Government.  The Bolsheviki, in control at Petrograd, opened negotiations with the Central Powers for an armistice along the entire front from the Baltic to Asia Minor, and on December 17th, such an armistice went into effect. Meanwhile they began negotiations for a treaty of peace. General Dukholin, the Commander-in-Chief, on November 20th, was ordered by Lenine to propose the armistice. To this request he made no reply, and on November 21st, he was deposed and Ensign Krylenko was appointed the new Commander-in-Chief. General Dukholin was subsequently murdered, by being thrown from a train after the Bolsheviki seized the general headquarters.  Trotzky sent a note to the representatives of neutral powers in Petrograd, informing them of his proposal for an armistice, and stating \"The consummation of an immediate peace is demanded in all countries, both belligerent and neutral. The Russian Government counts on the firm support of workmen in all countries in this struggle for peace.\" Lenine, however, declared that Russia did not contemplate a separate peace with Germany, and that the Russian Government, before agreeing to an armistice, would communicate with the Allies and make a certain proposal to the imperialistic governments of France and England, rejection of which would place them in open opposition to the wishes of their own people.  A period of turmoil followed. In the meantime elections for the Constituent Assembly were held. The result in Petrograd was announced as 272,000 votes for the Bolsheviki, 211,000 for the Constitutional Democrats, and 116,000 for the Social Revolutionaries, showing that the Bolsheviki failed to attain a majority. Notwithstanding the prevailing chaos, the Lenine-Trotzky Government persisted in negotiations for an armistice, and it was arranged that the first conference be held at the German headquarters at Brest-Litovsk.  The Russian delegates were Kamenev, whose real name was Rosenfelt, a well known Bolshevist leader; Sokolnikov, a sailor; Bithenko, a soldier, and Mstislasky, who had formerly been librarian to the General Staff, but who was now a strong Socialist. Representatives were present of Germany, Austria-Hungary, Turkey and Bulgaria.  After many interchanges of opinion a suspension of hostilities for ten days was authorized, to be utilized in bringing to a conclusion negotiations for an armistice. On December 7th it was announced from Petrograd that for the first time since the war not a shot was fired on the Russian front. Foreign Secretary Trotzky, on the 6th of December, notified the allied embassies in Petrograd of these negotiations and added that the armistice would be signed only on condition that the troops should not be transferred from one front to another. He announced that negotiations had been suspended to afford the Allied Governments opportunity to define their attitude toward the peace negotiation; that is, their willingness or refusal to participate in negotiations for an armistice and peace. In case of refusal they must declare clearly and definitely before all mankind the aims for which the peoples of Europe had been called to shed their blood during the fourth year of the war.  No official replies were made to this note. On December 7th, Generals Kaledines and Kornilov raised the standard of revolt, but reports indicated that the Bolsheviki were extending their control over all Russia. A meeting of the Constituent Assembly took place on December 11th. Less than 50 of the 600 delegates attended. Meanwhile the negotiations for an armistice continued. On December 16th an agreement was reached and an armistice signed, to continue from December 17th to January 14th, 1918.   [Illustration: Map: All of Europe and Asia, showing the Trans-Siberian Railway and other railroads.]   RUSSIA\\'S GREAT RAILWAY LINK BETWEEN VLADIVOSTOK AND THE ARCTIC OCEAN   The Czecho-Slovaks took possession of long stretches of the   Trans-Siberian Railroad. Japan lent her aid in the east, and American   and Allied troops swept down from the Murman coast in the northwest.   Within the first month in which the Bolsheviki conducted the government numerous edicts of a revolutionary character were issued. Class titles, distinctions and privileges were abolished; the corporate property of nobles, merchants and burgesses was to be handed over to the state, as was all church property, lands, money and precious stones; and religious instruction was to cease in the schools. Strikes were in progress everywhere, and disorder was rampant.  Kornilov, Terestchenko and other associates of Kerensky, were imprisoned in the Fortress of SS. Peter and Paul; the Cadet Party was outlawed by decree and the houses of its leaders raided. On January 8, 1918, it was announced that the Bolsheviki had determined that all loans and Treasury bonds held by foreign subjects, abroad or in Russia, were repudiated.  During this period the Bolsheviki\\'s Foreign Secretary astonished the world by making public the secret treaties between Russia and foreign governments in the early years of the war. These treaties dealt with the proposed annexation by Russia of the Dardanelles, Constantinople and certain areas in Asia Minor; with the French claim on Alsace-Lorraine and the left bank of the Rhine; with offers to Greece, for the purpose of inducing her to assist Serbia; with plans to alter her Western boundaries, with the British and Russian control of Persia; and with Italy\\'s desire to annex certain Austrian territories. These treaties had been seized upon the Bolsheviki assumption of power, and were now repudiated by the new government.  During the period of the armistice Lenine began his move for a separate peace, in spite of the formal protests of the Allied representatives at Petrograd.  The first sitting took place on Saturday, December 22, 1917. Among the delegates were Dr. Richard von Kuhlmann, Foreign Minister, and General Hoffman, of Germany; Count Czernin, Foreign Minister of Austria-Hungary; Minister Kopov, of Bulgaria; Nesimy Bey, former Foreign Minister of Turkey, and a large delegation from Russia, composed of Bolshevist leaders. Dr. von Kuhlmann was chosen as the presiding officer and made the opening speech. The Russian peace demands and the German counter-proposals were then read, and considered.  The German proposals proved unacceptable to Russia, and a second session of the peace conference was held at Brest-Litovsk on January 10, 1918. Trotzky himself attended this meeting as one of the representatives from Russia, and there was also a representative from Ukraine, which had declared its independence, and was allowed to join the conference. General Hoffman protested strongly against the Russian endeavor to make appeals of a revolutionary character to the German troops.   [Illustration: Map: Europe and Eastern Asia.]   RUSSIA AS PARTITIONED BY THE BREST-LITOVSK TREATY   The armistice having expired, it was agreed it should be continued to February 12th. After a long and acrimonious debate the Conference broke up in a clash over the evacuation of the Russian provinces. On January 24th it was announced that the Russian delegates to the peace conference had unanimously decided to reject the German terms. They stated that when they asked Germany\\'s final terms General Hoffman of the German delegation had replied by opening a map and pointing out a line from the shores of the Gulf of Finland to the east of the Moon Sound Islands, to Valk, to the west of Minsk, to Brest-Litovsk, thus eliminating Courland and all the Baltic provinces.  Asked the terms of the Central Powers in regard to the territory south of Brest-Litovsk General Hoffman replied that was a question which they would discuss only with Ukraine. M. Kaminev asked: \"Supposing we do not agree to such condition, what are you going to do?\"  General Hoffman\\'s answer was, \"Within a week we would occupy Reval.\"  On January 27th, Trotzky made his report to the Soviets at Petrograd. After a thorough explanation of the peace debates, he declared that the Government of the Soviets could not sign such a peace. It was then decided to demobilize the Russian army and withdraw from the war.   [Illustration: Map]   GENERAL MAP OF THE BALTIC SEA   With the collapse of Russia German forces advanced from Riga, along   the Gulf of Finland occupying Reval and threatening Petrograd.  Final sessions of the peace congress were resumed at Brest-Litovsk January 29th; a peace treaty was made between the Central Powers and the Ukraine, and the Bolsheviki yielded to the German demands without signing a treaty. Meanwhile the Russian Constituent Assembly which met at Petrograd on January 19th, was dissolved on January 20th, by the Bolsheviki Council.  Disorders continued throughout all Russia and counter-revolutionary movements were started at many places. On February 18th, the day when the armistice agreement between Russia and the Central Powers expired, German forces began a new invasion of Russia. The next day the Bolshevist Government issued a statement, announcing that Russia would be compelled to sign a peace. The German advance went on rapidly, and many important Russian cities were occupied. On February 24th, the Bolshevist Government announced that peace terms had been accepted, and a treaty was signed at Brest-Litovsk on March 3d.  On March 14th the All-Russia Council of Soviets voted to ratify the treaty, after an all-night sitting. Lenine pronounced himself in favor of accepting the German terms; Trotzky stood for war, but did not attend the meetings of the Council. Lenine defended the step by pointing out that the country was completely unable to offer resistance, and that peace was indispensable for the completion of the social war in Russia.  The new treaty dispossessed Russia of territories amounting to nearly one-quarter of the area of European Russia, and inhabited by one-third of Russia\\'s total population. Trotzky resigned on account of his opposition to the treaty and was succeeded by M. Tchitcherin. He became Chairman of the Petrograd Labor Commune. The treaty between Russia and the Central Powers was formally denounced by the Premiers and Foreign Ministers of Great Britain, France, and Italy, and was not recognized by the Allied nations.  A final revocation of its provisions by both sides did not put an end to the military operations of the Central Powers in Russia, nor did the Russians cease to make feeble and sporadic attempts at resistance. Germany was forced to keep large bodies of troops along the Russian front, but formally Russia\\'s part in the war had come to an end.

[Illustration: Photograph]   Copyright G. V. Buck, Washington. D. C.   THE CARGO SUBMARINE \"DEUTSCHLAND\"   Shortly before the United States entered the war, Germany sent over a   merchant submarine with a cargo of dye stuffs and drugs, an implied   threat which was later realized in the U-boat attacks on the American   coast.    CHAPTER XXXII  GERMANY\\'S OBJECT LESSON TO THE UNITED STATES.  During the first two years of the war many Americans, especially those in the West, observed the great events which were happening with great interest, no doubt, but with a feeling of detachment. The war was a long way off. The Atlantic Ocean separated Europe from America, and it seemed almost absurd to think that the Great War could ever affect us.  In the year 1916, however, two events happened which seemed to bring the war to our door. The first was the arrival at Baltimore, on July 9th, of the Deutschland, a German submarine of great size, built entirely for commercial purposes, and the second was the appearance, on the 7th of October, of a German war submarine in the harbor at Newport, Rhode Island, and its exploit on the following day when it sunk a number of British and neutral vessels just outside the three-mile line on the Atlantic coast.  The performances of these two vessels were equally suggestive, but the popular feeling with regard to what they had done was very divergent. The voyage of the Deutschland roused the widest admiration but the action of the U-53 stirred up the deepest indignation. Yet the voyages of each showed with equal clearness that, however much America might consider herself separated from the Great War, the new scientific invention, the submarine, had annihilated space, and America, too, was now but a neighbor of the nations at war.  The voyage of the Deutschland was a romance in itself. It was commanded by Captain Paul Koenig, a German officer of the old school. He had been captain of the Schleswig of the North German Lloyd, and of other big liners. When the power of the British fleet drove German commerce from the seas, he had found himself without a job, and, as he phrased it, \"was drifting about the country like a derelict.\" One day, in September, 1915, he was asked to meet Herr Alfred Lohmann, an agent of the North German Lloyd Line, and surprised by an offer to navigate a submarine cargo ship from Germany to America. Captain Koenig, who seems to have been in every way an admirable personage, at once consented. He has told us the story of his trip in his interesting book called \"The Voyage of the Deutschland.\"  The Deutschland itself was three hundred feet long, thirty feet wide, and carried one thousand tons of cargo and a crew of twenty-nine men. It cost a half a million dollars, but paid for itself in the first trip. According to Captain Koenig the voyage on the whole seems to have been most enjoyable. He understood his boat well and had watched its construction. Before setting out on his voyage he carefully trained his crew, and experimented with the Deutschland until he was thoroughly familiar with all its peculiarities. The cargo was composed of dye stuffs, and the ship was well supplied with provisions and comforts. In his description of the trip he lays most emphasis upon the discomfort resulting from heavy weather and from storms. He was able to avoid all danger from hostile ships by the very simple process of diving. No English ship approached him closely as he was always able to see them from a distance, usually observing their course by means of their smoke.  One of his liveliest adventures, however, occurred when attempting to submerge suddenly during a heavy sea on the appearance of a destroyer. The destroyer apparently never observed the Deutschland, but in the endeavor to dive quickly the submarine practically stood on its head, and dived down into the mud, where it found itself held fast. Captain Koenig however was equal to the emergency, and by balancing and trimming the tanks he finally restored the center of gravity and released his boat.  A considerable portion of his trip was passed upon the surface as he only submerged when there was suspicion of danger. According to his story his men kept always in the highest spirits. They had plenty of music, and doubtless appreciated the extraordinary nature of their voyage.  An amusing incident during the trip was the attempt to camouflage his ship by a frame work, made of canvas and so constructed as to give the outline of a steamer. One day a hostile steamer appeared in the distance and Captain Koenig proceeded to test his disguise.  After great difficulties, especially in connection with the production of smoke, he finally had the whole construction fairly at work. The steamer, which had been peacefully going its way, on seeing the new ship suddenly changed her course and steered directly toward the Deutschland. It evidently took the Deutschland for some kind of a wreck and was hurrying to give it assistance. Captain Koenig at once pulled off his super-structure and revealed himself as a submarine, and the strange vessel veered about and hurried off as fast as it could.  On the arrival of the Deutschland in America Captain Koenig and his crew found their difficulties over. All arrangements had been made by representatives of the North German Lloyd for their safety and comfort. As they ran up Chesapeake Bay they were greeted by the whistles of the neutral steamers that they passed. The moving-picture companies immortalized the crew and they were treated with the utmost hospitality.  The Allied governments protested that the Deutschland was really a war vessel and on the 12th of July a commission of three American naval officers was sent down from Washington to make an investigation. The investigation showed the Deutschland was absolutely unarmed and the American Government decided not to interfere.  The position of the Allies was that a submarine, even though without guns or torpedoes, was practically a vessel of war from its very nature, and for it to pretend to be a merchant vessel was as if some great German man-of-war should dismount its guns and pass them over to some tender and then undertake to visit an American port. They argued that if the submarine would come out from harbor it might be easily fitted with detachable torpedo tubes, and become as dangerous as any U-boat. Even without arms it might easily sink an unarmed merchant vessel by ramming. But the United States was not convinced, and American citizens rather admired the genial captain.  His return was almost as uneventful as his voyage out. At the very beginning he had trouble in not being able to rise after an experimental dive. This misadventure was caused by a plug of mud which had stopped up the opening of the manometer. But the difficulty was overcome, and he was able to pass under water between the British ships which were on the lookout. His return home was a triumph. Hundreds of thousands of people gathered along the banks of the Weser, filled with the greatest enthusiasm. Poems were written in his honor and his appearance was everywhere greeted with enthusiastic applause. The Germans felt sure that through the Deutschland and similar boats they had broken the British blockade.  Captain Koenig made a second voyage, landing at New London, Connecticut, on November 1st, where he took on a cargo of rubber, nickel and other valuable commodities. On November 16th, in attempting to get away to sea, he met with a collision with the tug T. A. Scott, Jr., and had to return to New London for repairs. He concluded his voyage, however, without difficulty. In spite of his success the Germans did not make any very great attempt to develop a fleet of submarine cargo boats.  The other German act which brought home to Americans the possibilities of the submarine, the visit of the U-53, was a very different sort of matter. U-53 was a German submarine of the largest type. On October 7, 1916, it made a sudden appearance at Newport, and its captain, Lieutenant-Captain Hans Rose, was entertained as if he were a welcome guest. He sent a letter to the German Ambassador at Washington and received visitors in his beautiful boat. The U-53 was a war submarine, two hundred and thirteen feet long, with two deck guns and four torpedo tubes. It had been engaged in the war against Allied commerce in the Mediterranean. Captain Rose paid formal visits to Rear-Admiral Austin Knight, Commander of the United States Second Naval District, stationed at Newport, and Rear-Admiral Albert Gleaves, Commander of the American destroyer flotilla at that place, and then set out secretly to his destination.  On the next day the news came in that the U-53 had sunk five merchant vessels. These were the Strathdene, which was torpedoed; the West Point, a British freighter, also torpedoed; the Stephano, a passenger liner between New York and Halifax, which the submarine attempted to sink by opening its sea valves but was finally torpedoed; the Blommersdijk, a Dutch freighter, and the Christian Knudsen, a Norwegian boat. The American steamer Kansan was also stopped, but allowed to proceed. When the submarine began its work wireless signals soon told what was happening, and Admiral Knight, with the Newport destroyer flotilla, hurried to the rescue. These destroyers picked up two hundred and sixteen men and acted with such promptness that not a single life was lost.  The action of the U-53 produced intense excitement in America. The newspapers were filled with editorial denunciation, and the people were roused to indignation. The American Government apparently took the ground that the Germans were acting according to law and according to their promise to America. They had given warning in each case and allowed the crews of the vessels which they sunk to take to their boats. This was believed to be a fulfilment of their pledge \"not to sink merchant vessels without warning and without saving human lives, unless the ship attempts to escape or offers resistance.\"  The general feeling, however, of American public opinion was that it was a brutal act. In the case of the Stephano there were ninety-four passengers. These, together with the crew, were placed adrift in boats at eight o\\'clock in the evening, in a rough sea sixty miles away from the nearest land. If the American destroyer fleet had not rushed to the rescue it is extremely likely that a great many of these boats would never have reached land. The German Government did not save these human lives. It was the American navy which did that. But, technicalities aside, the pride of the American people was wounded. They could not tolerate a situation in which American men-of-war should stand idly by and watch a submarine in a leisurely manner sink ships engaged in American trade whose passengers and crews contained many American citizens.  It was another one of those foolish things that Germans were constantly doing, which gave them no appreciable military advantage, but stirred up against them the sentiment of the world. The Germans perhaps were anxious to show the power of the submarines, and to give America an object lesson in that power. They wished to make plain that they could destroy overseas trade, and that if the United States should endeavor to send troops across the water they would be able to sink those troops.  The Germans probably never seriously contemplated a blockade of the American coast. The U-53 returned to its base and the danger was ended. American commerce went peacefully on, and the net result of the German audacity was in the increase of bitterness in the popular feeling toward the German methods.    CHAPTER XXXIII  AMERICA TRANSFORMED BY WAR  When Germany threw down the gauge of battle to the civilized world, the German High Command calculated that the long, rigorous and thorough military training to which every male German had submitted, would make a military force invincible in the field. The High Command believed that a nation so trained would carve out victory after victory and would end the World War before any nation could train its men sufficiently to check the Teutonic rush.  To that theory was opposed the democratic conception that the free nations of earth could train their young men intensively for six months and send these vigorous free men into the field to win the final decision over the hosts of autocracy.  These antagonistic theories were tried out to a finish in the World War and the theory of democracy, developed in the training camps of America, Canada, Australia, Britain, France and Italy, triumphed. Especially in the training camps of America was the German theory disproved. There within six months the best fighting troops on earth were developed and trained in the most modern of war-time practices. Everything that Germany could devise found its answer in American ingenuity, American endurance and American skill.  The entrance of America into the tremendous conflict on April 6, 1917 was followed immediately by the mobilization of the entire nation. Business and industry of every character were represented in the Council of National Defense which acted as a great central functioning organization for all industries and agencies connected with the prosecution of the war. Executives of rare talent commanding high salaries tendered their services freely to the government. These were the \"dollar a year men\" whose productive genius was to bear fruit in the clothing, arming, provisioning, munitioning and transportation of four million men and the conquest of Germany by a veritable avalanche of war material.  Out of the ranks of business and science came Hurley, Schwab, Piez, Coonley to drive forward a record-breaking shipbuilding program, Stettinius to speed up the manufacture of munitions, John W. Ryan to coordinate and accelerate the manufacture of airplanes, Vance C. McCormick and Dr. Alonzo E. Taylor to solve the problems of the War Trade Board, Hoover to multiply food production, to conserve food supplies and to place the army and citizenry of America upon food rations while maintaining the morale of the Allies through scientific food distribution and a host of other patriotic civilians who put the resources of the nation behind the military and naval forces opposed to Germany. Every available loom was put at work to make cloth for the army and the navy, the leather market was drained of its supplies to shoe our forces with wear adapted to the drastic requirements of modern warfare.  German capital invested in American plants was placed under the jurisdiction of A. Mitchell Palmer as Alien Property Custodian. German ships were seized and transformed into American transports. Physicians over military age set a glorious example of patriotic devotion by their enlistment in thousands. Lawyers and citizens generally in the same category as to age entered the office of the Judge Advocate General or the ranks of the Four Minute Men or the American Protective League which rendered great service to the country in exposing German propaganda and in placing would-be slackers in military service. Bankers led the mighty Liberty Loan and War Savings Stamp drives and unselfishly placed the resources of their institutions at the service of the government.  Women and children rallied to the flag with an intensity of purpose, sacrifice and effort that demonstrated how completely was the heart of America in the war. Work in shops, fields, hospitals, Red Cross work rooms and elsewhere was cheerfully and enthusiastically performed and the sacrifices of food rationing, higher prices, lightless nights, gasolineless Sundays, diminished steam railway and trolley service were accepted with a multitude of minor inconvenience without a murmur. Congress had a free hand in making appropriations. The country approved without a minute\\'s hesitation bills for taxation that in other days would have brought ruin to the political party proposing them. Billions were voted to departments where hundreds of thousands had been the rule.   [Illustration: Map of the United States]   THE UNITED STATES AN ARMED CAMP   The map shows the location of the camps where the National Army and   the National Guard were trained for war. Afterwards the entire forces   were known as the United States Army   The true temper of the American people was carefully hidden from the German people by the German newspapers acting under instructions from the Imperial Government. Instead of the truth, false reports were printed in the newspapers of Berlin and elsewhere that the passage of the American conscription law had been followed by rioting and rebellion in many places and that fully fifty per cent of the American people was opposed to the declaration of war. The fact that the selective service act passed in May, 1917, was accepted by everybody in this country as a wholly equitable and satisfactory law did not permeate into Germany until the first American Expeditionary Force had actually landed in France.  America\\'s fighting power was demonstrated conclusively to the Germanic intellect at Seicheprey, Bouresches Wood, Belleau Wood, Chateau-Thierry, and in the Forest of the Argonne. Especially was it demonstrated when it came to fighting in small units, or in individual fighting. The highly disciplined and highly trained German soldiers were absolutely unfitted to cope with Americans, Canadians and Australians when it came to matching individual against individual, or small group against small group.  This was shown in the wild reaches of the Forest of the Argonne. There the machine-gun nests of the Germans were isolated and demolished speedily. Small parties of Germans were stalked and run down by the relentless Americans. On the other hand, the Germans could make no headway against the American troops operating in the Forest. The famous \"Lost Battalion\" of the 308th United States Infantry penetrated so far in advance of its supports that it was cut off for four days without food, water or supplies of munitions in the Argonne. The enemy had cut its line of communication and was enforced both in front and in the rear. Yet the lost battalion, comprising two companies armed with rifles and the French automatic rifle known as the Chauchat gun, called by the doughboys \"Sho Sho,\" held out against the best the overpowering forces of the Germans could send against them, and were ultimately rescued from their dangerous position.  The training of the Americans was also in modern efficiency that made America prominent in the world of industry. The reduction of the German salient at St. Mihiel was an object lesson to the Germans in American methods.  General Pershing commanding that operation in person, assembled the newspaper correspondents the day before the drive. Maps were shown, giving the extent and locale of the attack. The correspondents were invited to follow the American troops and a time schedule for the advance was given to the various corps commanders.  In that operation, 152 square miles of territory and 72 villages were captured outright. For the reduction of the German defenses and for the creeping barrage preceding the American advance, more than 1,500,000 shells were fired by the artillery. Approximately 100,000 detail maps and 40,000 photographs prepared largely from aerial observations, were issued for the guidance of the artillery and the infantry. These maps and photographs detailed all the natural and artificial defenses of the entire salient. More than 5,000 miles of telephone wire was laid by American engineers immediately preceding the attack, and as the Americans advanced on the morning of the battle, September 12, 1918, 6,000 telephone instruments were connected with this wire. Ten thousand men were engaged in operating the hastily constructed telephone system; 3,000 carrier pigeons supplemented this work.  During the battle American airplanes swept the skies clear of enemy air-craft and signaled instructions to the artillery, besides attacking the moving infantry, artillery and supply trains of the enemy. So sure were the Americans of their success that moving-picture operators took more than 10,000 feet of moving picture film showing the rout of the Germans. Four thousand eight hundred trucks carried food, men and munitions into the lines. Miles of American railroads, both of standard and narrow gauge, carrying American-made equipment, assisted in the transportation of men and supplies. Hospital facilities including 35 hospital trains, 16,000 beds in the advanced sector, and 55,000 other beds back of the fighting line, were prepared. Less than ten per cent of this hospital equipment was used.  As the direct consequence of this preparation, which far outstripped anything that any other nation had attempted in a similar offensive, the Americans with a remarkably small casualty list took 15,188 prisoners, 111 guns, many of them of large caliber, immense quantities of munitions and other supplies, and inflicted heavy death losses upon the fleeing Germans.  Two selective service laws operated as manhood conscription. The first of these took men between the ages of twenty-one and thirty-one years inclusive. June 5, 1917, was fixed as registration day. The total number enrolled was 9,586,508. The first selective army drawn from this number was 625,000 men.  The second selective service legislation embraced all citizens between the ages of 18 and 45 inclusive, not included in the first draft. Over 13,000,000 men enrolled on September 12, 1918.  The grand total of registrants in both drafts was 23,456,021. Youths who had not completed their 19th year were set apart in a group to be called last and men between thirty-six and forty-five were also put in a deferred class. The government\\'s plan was to have approximately 5,000,000 men under arms before the summer of 1919. The German armistice on November 11th found 4,000,000 men actually under arms and an assignment of 250,000 made to the training camps.  A most important factor in the training plans of the United States was that incorporated in the organization of the Students\\' Army Training Corps, by which 359 American colleges and universities were taken over by the government and 150,000 young men entered these institutions for the purpose of becoming trained soldiers. The following are the conditions under which the S. A. T. C. was organized:  The War Department undertook to furnish officers, uniforms, rifles, and equipment, and to assign the students to military duty, after a few months, either at an officers\\' training camp or in some technical school, or in a regular army cantonment with troops as a private, according to the degree of aptitude shown on the college campus.  At the same time a circular letter to the presidents of colleges arranged for a contract under which the government became responsible for the expense of the housing, subsistence, and instruction of the students. The preliminary arrangement contained this provision, among others:   The per diem rate of $1 for subsistence and housing is to govern temporarily, pending examination of the conditions in the individual institution and a careful working out of the costs involved. The amount so fixed is calculated from the experience of this committee during the last five months in contracting with over 100 collegiate institutions for the housing and subsistence of over 100,000 soldiers in the National Army Training Detachment. This experience indicates that the average cost of housing is 15 to 20 cents per day; subsistence (army ration or equivalent), 70 to 80 cents per day. The tuition charge is based on the regular per diem tuition charge of the institution in the year 1917-18.   A permanent contract was arranged later under these governing principles:   The basis of payment will be reimbursement for actual and necessary costs to the institutions for the services rendered to the government in the maintenance and instruction of the soldiers with the stated limitation as to cost of instruction. Contract price will be arrived at by agreement after careful study of the conditions in each case, in conference with authorities of the institution.  The War Department will have authority to specify and control the courses of instruction to be given by the institution.  The entity and power for usefulness of the institutions will be safeguarded so that when the contract ends the institutions shall be in condition to resume their functions of general education.  The teaching force will be preserved so far as practicable, and this matter so treated that its members shall feel that in changing to the special intensive work desired by the government they are rendering a vital and greatly needed service.  The government will ask from the institutions a specific service; that is, the housing, subsistence, and instruction along specified lines of a certain number of student soldiers. There will be no interference with the freedom of the institution in conducting other courses in the usual way.  The contract will be for a fixed term, probably nine months, subject to renewal for a further period on reasonable notice, on terms to be agreed upon and subject to cancellation on similar terms.  The story of the life of the American army behind the lines in France would fill a volume. The hospitality of the French people had something pathetic in it. They were expecting miracles of their new Allies. They were war sick. Nearly all of them had lost some father, or brother, or husband, and here came these big, hearty, joyous soldiers, full of ardor and confident of victory. It put a new spirit into all France. Their reception when they first landed was a scene of such fervor and enthusiasm as had never been known before and probably will not be known again. Soon the American soldier, in his khaki, with his wide-brimmed soft hat, became a common sight.  The villagers put up bunting, calico signs, flags and had stocks of American canned goods to show in their shop windows. The children, when bold, played with the American soldiers, and the children that were more shy ventured to go up and touch an American soldier\\'s leg. Very old peasant ladies put on their Sunday black, and went out walking, and in some mysterious way talking with American soldiers. The village mayors turned out and made speeches, utterly incomprehensible to the American soldiers.  The engineering, building and machinery works the Americans put up were astonishing. Gangs of workers went over in thousands; many of these were college men. They dug and toiled as efficiently as any laborer. One American major told with glee how a party of these young workers arrived straight from America at 3.30 P. M. and started digging at 5 A. M. next morning, \"and they liked it, it tickled them to death.\" Many of these draftees, in fact, were sick and tired of inaction in ports before their departure from America, and they welcomed work in France as if it were some great game.  Perhaps the biggest work of all the Americans performed was a certain aviation camp and school. In a few months it was completed, and it was the biggest of its kind in the world. The number of airplanes used merely for training was in itself remarkable. The flying men--or boys--who had, of course, already been broken-in in America, did an additional course in France, and when they left the aviation camp they were absolutely ready for air-fighting at the front. This was the finishing school. The aviators went through eight distinct courses in the school. They were perfected in flying, in observation, in bombing, in machine-gun firing. On even a cloudy and windy day the air overhead buzzed with these young American fliers, all getting into the pink of condition to do their stunts at the front. They lived in the camp, and it required moving heaven and earth for one of them to get leave to go even to the nearest little quiet old town.  An impression of complete businesslike determination was what one got when visiting the Americans in France. A discipline even stricter than that which applied in British and French troops was in force. In towns, officers, for instance, were not allowed out after 9 P. M. Some towns where subalterns discovered the wine of the country were instantly put \"out of bounds.\" No officer, on any pretext whatsoever was allowed to go to Paris except on official business.  The postal censors who read the letters of the American Expeditionary Force were required to know forty-seven languages! Of these languages, the two least used were Chinese and German.  The announcement of the organization of the first American Field Army was contained in the following dispatch from France, August 11, 1918:  \"The first American field army has been organized. It is under the direct command of General John J. Pershing, Commander-in-Chief of the American forces. The corps commanders thus far announced are Major-Generals Liggett, Bullard, Bundy, Read, and Wright.   [Illustration: Chart]   Key   The state of German civilian morale.

SECRETARY OF WAR\\'S OFFICIAL CHART   This reproduction of Secretary Baker\\'s chart, which hung in his office   at Washington, illustrates graphically Germany\\'s success and failure   in the war.   \"The creation of the first field army is the first step toward the coordination of all the American forces in France. This does not mean the immediate withdrawal from the British and French commands of all American units, and it is probable that divisions will be used on the French and British fronts for weeks yet. It is understood, however, that the policy of organizing other armies will be carried out steadily.\"  This announcement marked a milestone in the military effort of the United States. When the American troops first arrived in France, they were associated in small units with the French to get primary training. Gradually regiments began to function under French division commanders. Then American divisions were formed and trained under French corps commanders. Next, American corps began to operate under French army commanders. Finally, the first American army was created, because enough divisions and corps had been graduated from the school of experience.  An American division numbers 30,000 men, and a corps consists of six divisions, two of which play the part of reserves. With auxiliary troops, air squadrons, tank sections, heavy artillery, and other branches, a corps numbers from 225,000 to 250,000 men.   [Illustration: Chart]   The main line in this graph--the heavy broken line--represents the   state of civilian morale in Germany.    German morale is arbitrarily regarded as standing at 100 % in August.   1914.    Zero, for the same line, is taken to be the point at which an   effective majority of the German people will refuse longer to support   the war.    The degree of movement of this line is determined mainly by a   consideration of the deflections of the secondary lines which   represent the forces exerting the greatest influence on the German   state of mind.

Bullard Third corps--Major-General William M. Wright. Fourth corps--Major-General George W. Read. Fifth corps--Major-General Omar Bundy.   Seven divisions and one separate regiment of American troops participated in the counter-offensive between Chateau-Thierry and Soissons and in resisting the German attack in the Champagne, it was officially stated on July 20. The 42d, or \"Rainbow\" Division, composed of National Guard troops from twenty-six states and the District of Columbia, including the New York 69th Infantry, now designated as the 165th Infantry, took part in the fighting in the Champagne east of Rheims. The six other divisions were associated with the French in the counter-offensive between Chateau-Thierry and Soissons. These divisions were the 1st, 2d, 3d and 4th of the Regular Army, the 26th National Guard Division, composed of troops from the six New England States, and the 28th, composed of the Pennsylvania National Guard. Marines were included in this number. The separate regiment that fought in the Champagne was a negro unit attached to the new 93d Division, composed entirely of negro troops. It was also announced that the 77th Division was \"in the line near Luneville\" and was \"operating as a division, complete under its own commander.\"  The 42d Division had the distinction, General March announced on August 3d, of defeating the 4th Division of the crack Prussian Guards, professional soldiers of the German standing army, who had never before failed. General March also disclosed the fact that another American division had been sent into that part of the Rheims salient where the Germans showed resistance. This was the 32d Division. \"The American divisions in the Rheims salient,\" General March said, \"have now been put in contiguously and are actually getting together as an American force. Southeast of Fere-en-Tardenois our 1st Corps is operating, with General Liggett in actual command.\"  The organization of twelve new divisions was announced by General March, Chief of Staff, in statements made on July 24th and July 31st. These divisions were numerically designated from 9 to 20, and organized at Camps Devens, Meade, Sheridan, Custer, Funston, Lewis, Logan, Kearny, Beauregard, Travis, Dodge, and Sevier. Each division had two infantry regiments of the regular army as nucleus, the other elements being made up of drafted men. The new divisions moved into the designated camps as the divisions already trained there moved out.  The composition of an American division is as follows:  Two brigades of infantry, each consisting of two regiments of infantry and one machine-gun battalion.  One brigade of artillery, consisting of three regiments of field artillery, and one trench mortar battery.  One regiment of engineers.  One field signal battalion.  The following trains: Headquarters and military police, sanitary, supply, engineer, and ammunition.  The following division units: Headquarters troop and one machine-gun battalion.

AMERICA GETS INTO THE WAR AT CANTIGNY   On the morning of May 28, 1918, the 1st Division, A. E. F., launched   its first attack, which took place at Cantigny. Within 45 minutes all   objectives had been gained, serious losses inflicted on the enemy, and   200 prisoners taken. General Pershing personally directed operations.   This picture shows American troops going forward under support of   tanks.   A general order of the War Department providing for the consolidation of all branches of the army into one army to be known as the \"United States Army\" was promulgated by General March on August 7th. The text of the order read:   1. This country has but one army--the United States Army. It includes all the land forces in the service of the United States. Those forces, however raised, lose their identity in that of the United States Army. Distinctive appellations, such as the Regular Army, Reserve Corps, National Army, and National Guard, heretofore employed in administration command, will be discontinued, and the single term, the United States Army, will be exclusively used.  2. Orders having reference to the United States Army as divided in separate and component forces of distinct origin, or assuming or contemplating such a division, are to that extent revoked.  3. The insignia now prescribed for the Regular Army shall hereafter be worn by the United States Army.  4. All effective commissions purporting to be, and described therein, as commissions in the Regular Army, National Guard, National Army, or the Reserve Corps, shall hereafter be held to be, and regarded as, commissions in the United States Army--permanent, provisional, or temporary, as fixed by the conditions of their issue; and all such commissions are hereby amended accordingly. Hereafter during the period of the existing emergency all commissions of officers shall be in the United States Army and in staff corps, departments, and arms of the service thereof, and shall, as the law may provide, be permanent, for a term, or for the period of the emergency. And hereafter during the period of the existing emergency provisional and temporary appointments in the grade of second lieutenant and temporary promotions in the Regular Army and appointments in the Reserve Corps will be discontinued.  5. While the number of commissions in each grade and each staff corps, department, and arm of the service shall be kept within the limits fixed by law, officers shall be assigned without reference to the term of their commissions solely in the interest of the service; and officers and enlisted men will be transferred from one organization to another as the interests of the service may require.  6. Except as otherwise provided by law, promotion in the United States Army shall be by selection. Permanent promotions in the Regular Army will continue to be made as prescribed by law.    CHAPTER XXXIV  HOW FOOD WON THE WAR  Food won the war. Without the American farmer the Entente Allies must have capitulated. Wheat, beef, corn, foods of every variety, hermetically sealed in tins, were thrown into the scales on the side of the Entente Allies in sufficient quantities to tip the balance toward the side of civilization and against autocracy. Late in the fall of 1918 when victory was assured to America and the Allies, there was received this message of appreciation from General Pershing to the farmers of America, through Carl Vrooman, Assistant Secretary of Agriculture:   AMERICAN EXPEDITIONARY FORCES, Office of the Commander-in-Chief, France, October 16, 1918. Honorable CARL VROOMAN, Assistant Secretary of Agriculture: DEAR MR. VROOMAN:--Will you please convey to farmers of America our profound appreciation of their patriotic services to the country and to the Allied armies in the field. They have furnished their full quota of fighting men; they have bought largely of Liberty Bonds; and they have increased their production of food crops both last year and this by over a thousand million bushels above normal production. Food is of vital military necessity for us and for our Allies, and from the day of our entry into the war America\\'s armies of food producers have rendered invaluable service to the Allied cause by supporting the soldiers at the front through their devoted and splendidly successful work in the fields and furrows at home. Very sincerely, JOHN J. PERSHING.  This tribute to the men and women on the farms of America from the head of the American forces in France is fit recognition of the important part played by American food producers in the war. It was early recognized by all the belligerent powers that final victory was a question of national morale and national endurance. Morale could not be maintained without food. The bread lines in Petrograd gave birth to the revolution, and Russian famine was the mother of Russian terrorism. German men and women, starved of fats and sweets, deteriorated so rapidly that the crime ratio both in towns and country districts mounted appallingly. Conditions in Austria-Hungary were even worse. Acute distress arising from threatening famine was instrumental in driving Bulgaria out of the war. The whole of Central Europe indeed was in the shadow of famine and the masses were crying out for peace at any price.  On the other hand, Germany\\'s greatest reliance for a victorious decision lay in the U-boat blockade of Great Britain, France and Italy. Though some depredations came to these countries, the submarine blockade never fully materialized and with its failure Germany\\'s hopes faded and died.  The Entente Allies and the United States were fortunate in securing Herbert C. Hoover to administer food distribution throughout their lands and to stimulate food production by the farmers of the United States. After his signal success in the administration of the Belgian Relief Commission, Mr. Hoover became the unanimous choice of the Allies for the victualing of the militant and civilian populations after America\\'s entrance into the World War. His work divided itself into three heads:  First, stimulation of food production.  Second, elimination of food wastage in the homes and public eating places of the country.  Third, education of food dealers and the public in the use of such foods as were substitutes for wheat, rye, pork, beef and sugar.  After long and acrimonious debates in Congress, Mr. Hoover, as Federal Food Administrator, was clothed with extraordinary powers enabling him to fulfil the purposes for which he was appointed. The ability with which he and his associates performed their work was demonstrated in the complete debacle of Bulgaria, Turkey, Austria-Hungary and Germany. These countries were starved out quite as truly as they were fought out. The concrete evidence of the Food Administration\\'s success is shown in the subjoined table which indicates the increase over normal in exporting of foodstuffs by the United States since it became the food reservoir for the world on account of the war.  TOTAL EXPORTS     3-year          1916-17      1917-18      July, 1917 to    July,1918 to     pre-war         fiscal       fiscal     average.        year.        year.        Sept. 30,1917.

Upon the same subject Mr. Hoover himself after the harvest of 1918 said:   It is now possible to summarize the shipments of foodstuffs from the United States to the allied countries during the fiscal year just closed--practically the last harvest year. These amounts include all shipments to allied countries for their and our armies, the civilian population, the Belgium relief, and the Red Cross. The figures indicate the measure of effort of the American people in support of allied food supplies.  The total value of these food shipments, which were in the main purchased through, or with the collaboration of the Food Administration, amounted to, roundly, $1,400,000,000 during the fiscal year.  The shipments of meats and fats (including meat products, dairy products, vegetable oils, etc.) to allied destinations were as follows:      POUNDS   Fiscal year 1916-17   2,166,500,000   Fiscal year 1917-18   3,011,100,000                       -----------------   Increase                844,600,000  Our slaughterable animals at the beginning of the last fiscal year were not appreciably larger in number than the year before; and particularly in hogs, there were probably less. The increase in shipments is due to conservation and the extra weight of animals added by our farmers.  The full effect of these efforts began to bear their best results in the last half of the fiscal year, when the exports to the Allies were 2,133,100,000 pounds, as against 1,266,500,000 pounds in the same period of the year before. This compares with an average of 801,000,000 pounds of total exports for the same half years of the three-year pre-war period.  In cereals and cereal products reduced to terms of cereal bushels, our shipments to allied destinations have been:      BUSHELS   Fiscal year 1916-17   259,900,000   Fiscal year 1917-18   340,800,000                        ------------   Increase               80,900,000  Of these cereals our shipments of the prime breadstuffs in the fiscal year 1917-18 to allied destinations were: Wheat, 131,000,000 bushels and rye 13,900,000 bushels, a total of 144,900,000 bushels.  The exports to allied destinations during the fiscal year 1916-17 were: Wheat, 135,100,000 bushels and rye, 2,300,000 bushels, a total of 137,400,000 bushels. In addition, some 10,000,000 bushels of 1917 wheat are now in port for allied destinations or en route thereto. The total shipments to allied countries from our last harvest of wheat will be, therefore, about 141,000,000 bushels, or a total of 154,900,000 bushels of prime breadstuffs.  In addition to this we have shipped some 10,000,000 bushels to neutrals dependent upon us and we have received some imports from other quarters. A large part of the other cereals exported has also gone into war bread.  It is interesting to note that since the urgent request of the Allied Food Controllers early in the year for a further shipment of 75,000,000 bushels from our 1917 wheat than originally planned, we shall have shipped to Europe, or have en route, nearly 85,000,000 bushels. At the time of this request our surplus was already more than exhausted.  This accomplishment of our people in this matter stands out even more clearly if we bear in mind that we had available in the fiscal year 1916-17 from net carryover and a surplus over our normal consumption about 200,000,000 bushels of wheat which we were able to export that year without trenching on our home loaf. This last year, however, owing to the large failure of the 1917 wheat crop we had available from net carry over and production and imports only just about our normal consumption. Therefore our wheat shipments to allied destinations represent approximately savings from our own wheat bread.  These figures, however, do not fully convey the volume of the effort and sacrifice made during the past year by the whole American people. Despite the magnificent effort of our agricultural population in planting a much increased acreage in 1917, not only was there a very large failure in wheat, but also the corn failed to mature properly, and corn is our dominant crop.  We calculate that the total nutritional production of the country for the fiscal year just closed was between seven per cent and nine per cent below the average of the three previous years, our nutritional surplus for export in those years being about the same amount as the shrinkage last year. Therefore the consumption and waste in food have greatly reduced in every direction during the year.  I am sure that the millions of our people, agricultural as well as urban, who have contributed to these results, should feel a very definite satisfaction that, in a year of universal food shortage in the Northern Hemisphere, all of these people joined together against Germany have come through into sight of the coming harvest not only with health and strength fully maintained, but with only temporary periods of hardship. The European Allies have been compelled to sacrifice more than our own people, but we have not failed to load every steamer since the delays of the storm months of last winter.  Our contributions to this end could not have been accomplished without effort and sacrifice, and it is a matter for further satisfaction, that it had been accomplished voluntarily and individually. It is difficult to distinguish between various sections of our people--the homes, public eating places, food trades, urban or agricultural populations--in assessing credit for these results, but no one will deny the dominant part of the American woman.   But the work of the Food Administration did not come to an end with the close of the war. Insistent cries for food came from the members of the defeated Teutonic alliance, as well as from the suffering Allied and neutral nations. To meet those demands, Mr. Hoover sailed for Europe to organize the food relief of the needy nations. The State Department, explaining his mission, stated that as the first measure of assistance to Belgium it was necessary to increase immediately the volume of foodstuffs formerly supplied, so as to physically rehabilitate this under-nourished population. The relief commission during the four years of war sent to the 10,000,000 people in the occupied area over 600 cargoes of food, comprising 120,000,000 bushels of breadstuffs and over 3,000,000,000 pounds of other foodstuffs besides 20,000,000 garments, the whole representing an expenditure of nearly $600,000,000. The support of the commission came from the Belgian, British, French and American governments, together with public charity. In addition to this some $350,000,000 worth of native produce was financed internally in Belgium by the relief organization.  The second portion of Mr. Hoover\\'s mission was to organize and determine the need of foodstuffs to the liberated populations in Southern Europe--the Czecho-Slovaks, the Jugo-Slavs, and Serbians, Roumanians and others.  To meet the conditions in Europe following the armistice of November 11, 1918, the employment service of the United States set to work laying far-reaching plans for meeting the problem of world food shortage. The demands after the war were greater than they had been during the conflict but the nation that had fed the allies of civilization in war time performed the task of feeding the world, friend and foe alike, when peace at length came upon the earth.    CHAPTER XXXV  THE UNITED STATES NAVY IN THE WAR  Long before war was declared the United States Government had been engaged in preparation. It had realized that unrestricted submarine warfare was sure to lead to war, and though for a time it was preserving what it was pleased to call \"an armed neutrality\" the President doubtless was well aware what such an \"armed neutrality\" would lead to. Merchant ships were being armed for protection against the submarine, and crews from the Navy assigned to work the guns. The first collision was sure to mean an active state of war. The Naval Department, therefore, was working at full speed, getting the Navy ready for active service as soon as war should be declared.  Secretary Daniels made every effort to obtain the crews that were necessary to man the new ships which were being fully commissioned with the greatest possible speed and called upon newspapers all through the country to do their utmost to stimulate enlistment.  On March 26th President Wilson issued an order increasing the enlisted strength of the United States Marine Corps to 17,400 men, the limit allowed under the law. On March 29th a hundred and three ensigns were graduated from the Naval Academy three months ahead of their time, and on April 6th, as soon as war was declared, the Navy was mobilized.  Within a few minutes after Secretary Daniels had signed the order for this purpose one hundred code messages were sent out from the office of Admiral W. S. Benson, Chief of Naval Operations, which placed the Navy on a war basis, and put into the control of the Navy Department the naval militia of all the states as well as the Naval Reserves and the Coast Guard Service. In the Naval Militia were about 584 officers, and 7,933 men. These were at once assembled and assigned to coast patrol service. All of the ships that were in active commission in the Navy were already ready for duty. But there were reserve battleships and reserve destroyers, besides ships which had been out of commission which had to be manned as quickly as possible.  At the beginning of the war there were 361 vessels ready for service, including twelve first-line battleships, twenty-five second-line battleships, nine armored cruisers, twenty-four other cruisers, seven monitors, fifty destroyers, sixteen coast torpedo vessels, seventeen torpedo boats, forty-four submarines, eight tenders to torpedo boats, twenty-eight gunboats, four transports, four supply ships, one hospital ship, twenty-one fuel ships, fourteen converted yachts, forty-nine tugs, and twenty-eight minor vessels. There were about seventy thousand regularly enlisted men, besides eight thousand five hundred members of the naval militia. Many yachts together with their volunteer crews had been offered to the government by patriotic citizens.  For the complete mobilization of the Navy, as it then stood, 99,809 regularly enlisted men and 45,870 reserves were necessary. About twenty-seven thousand of these were needed for coast defense, and twelve thousand at the various shore stations. Retired officers were called out, and assigned to duty which would permit officers on the active list to be employed in sea duty. The Navy therefore still lacked thirty-five thousand men to bring it up to its full authorized strength at the beginning, but after the declaration of war an active recruiting campaign brought volunteers by thousands. The service was a popular one and recruits were easily obtained.  One of the first phases of the mobilization was the organization of a large fleet of mosquito craft to patrol the Atlantic Coast, and keep on the watch for submarines. Many of these boats had been private yachts, and hundreds of young men volunteered from the colleges and schools of the country for this work. Many boat builders submitted proposals to construct small boats for this kind of patrol duty, and on March 31st a coast patrol fleet was organized by the government under the command of Captain Henry B. Wilson.  The Navy took possession immediately on the declaration of war of all wireless stations in the United States dismantling all that could not be useful to the government. War zones were established along the whole coast line of the United States, making a series of local barred zones extending from the larger harbors in American waters all along the line. These harbors were barred at night to entering vessels in order to guard against surprise by German submarines. Contracts were awarded for the construction of twenty-four destroyers even before war was declared, and many more were already under construction.   [Illustration: Map]   MAP OF THE UNITED STATES SHOWING THE IMMENSE LENGTH OF COAST-LINE TO   BE DEFENDED   The growth of the Navy in one year may give some idea of the efficiency of the Navy Department. In April, 1917, the regular Navy contained 4,366 officers and 64,680 men. In April, 1918, it contained 7,798 officers and 192,385 men. In the Marine Corps in 1917 there were 426 officers and 13,266 men. In one year this was increased to 1,389 officers and 38,629 men. In the organization of the Naval Reserves, naval volunteers and coast guards there were in 1917, 24,569 men, in 1918, 98,319 men, and 11,477 officers.  While personnel of the Navy was thus expanding the United States battle fleet had grown to more than twice the size of the fleet before the war. When war was declared there were under construction 123 new naval vessels. These were completed and contracts made for 949 new vessels. Among the ships completed are fifteen battleships, six battle cruisers, seven scout cruisers, twenty-seven destroyers, and sixty-one submarines. About eight hundred craft were taken over and converted into transports, patrol service boats, submarine chasers, mine sweepers and mine layers.  The government also seized 109 German ships which had been interned in American ports. The Germans had attempted to damage these ships so that they would be useless, but they were all repaired, and carried American troops and supplies in great quantities to France.  As the fleet grew the training of the necessary officers and crews was conducted on a grand scale. Naval camps were established at various points. The main ones were those at Philadelphia, (League Island); Newport, Rhode Island; Cape May, New Jersey; Charleston, South Carolina; Pensacola, Florida; Key West, Florida; Mare Island, California; Puget Sound, Washington; Hingham, Massachusetts; Norfolk, Virginia; New Orleans, San Diego, New York Navy Yard; Great Lakes, Illinois; Pelham, New York; Hampton Roads, Virginia; and Gulfport, Mississippi. Schools in gunnery and engineering were established and thousands of gunners and engineers were trained, not only for the Navy but for the armed merchant vessels.  The training of gun crews by target practice was a feature of this work. Long before the war began systematic training of this kind had been done, but mainly in connection with the big guns, and great efficiency had been obtained by the steady practice. With the introduction of the submarine, it became necessary to pay special attention to the training of the crews of guns of smaller caliber, and it was not long before the officers of our Navy were congratulating themselves on the efficiency of their men. It is not easy to hit so small a mark as the periscope of a submarine, but it could be done and many times was done.  Twenty-eight days after the declaration of war a fleet of United States destroyers under the command of Admiral William S. Sims reported for service at a British port.  The American destroyer squadron arrived at Queenstown after a voyage without incident. The water front was lined with an excited crowd carrying small American flags, which cheered the destroyers from the time they were first seen until they reached the dock. They cheered again when Admiral Sims went ashore to greet the British senior officer who had come to welcome the Americans. It was a most informal function. After the usual handshakes the British commander congratulated the Americans on their safe voyage and then asked:  \"When will you be ready for business?\"  \"We can start at once,\" was the prompt reply of Admiral Sims.  This rather took the breath away from the British commander and he said he had not expected the Americans to begin work so soon after their long voyage. Later after a short tour of the destroyers he admitted that the American tars looked prepared.  \"Yes,\" said the American commander, \"we made preparations on the way over. That is why we are ready.\"  Everything on board the destroyers was in excellent condition. The only thing lacking was heavier clothing. The American uniforms were too light for the cool weather which is common in the English waters. This condition, however, was quickly remedied, and the American ships at once put out to sea all in splendid condition and filled with the same enthusiasm that the Marines showed later at Chateau-Thierry.  \"They are certainly a fine body of men, and what\\'s more, their craft looked just as fit,\" declared the British commander.  One of the American destroyers, even before the American fleet had arrived at Queenstown, had begun war duty. It had picked up and escorted through the danger zone one of the largest of the Atlantic liners. The passengers on board the liner sent the commander of the destroyer the following message:   British passengers on board a steamer, bound for a British port, under the protection of an American destroyer, send their hearty greetings to her commander and her officers and crew, and desire to express their keen appreciation of this practical co-operation between the government and people of the United States and the British Empire, who are now fighting together for the freedom of the seas.   Moving pictures were taken by the official British Government photographer as the American flotilla came into the harbor, and sailors who received shore leave were plied with English hospitality. The streets of Queenstown were decorated with the Stars and Stripes. As soon as American residents in England learned that American warships were to cross the Atlantic they held a conference to provide recreation buildings, containing sleeping, eating, and recreation accommodations for the comfort of the American sailors. The destroyer flotilla was the first contribution of American military power to the Entente Alliance against Germany.  Admiral Sims is one of the most energetic and efficient of American naval officers and to him as much as to any other man is due the efficiency of the American Navy. During the period just before the Spanish-American War Lieutenant Sims was Naval Attache at Paris, and rendered invaluable services in buying ships and supplies for the Navy. In 1900 he was assigned to duty on the battleship Kentucky, then stationed in the Orient. In 1902 he was ordered to the Navy Department and placed in charge of the Office of Naval Practice, where he remained for seven years and devoted his attention to the improvement of the Navy in gunnery. During that time he made constant trips to England to consult with English experts in gunnery and ordnance, and became intimately acquainted with Sir Percy Scott, who had been knighted and made Rear-Admiral for the improvements he had introduced in connection with the gunnery of the British warships. In 1909 he was made commander of the battleship Minnesota, and in 1911 was a member of the college staff at the Naval War College. In 1913 he was made commander of the torpedo flotilla of the Atlantic fleet and in 1905 assigned to command the Dreadnaught Nevada. In 1916 he was President of the Naval War College. He was made Rear-Admiral in 1916 and Vice-Admiral in 1917 and assigned to the command of all American war vessels abroad.  Immediately upon their arrival the American vessels began operation in the submarine zone. Admiral Beatty then addressed the following message to Admiral Henry T. Mayo of the United States Atlantic Fleet:   The Grand Fleet rejoices that the Atlantic fleet will now share in preserving the liberties of the world and in maintaining the chivalry of the sea.   Admiral Mayo replied:   The United States Atlantic Fleet appreciates the message from the British fleet and welcomes opportunities for work with the British fleet for the freedom of the seas.   It may also be noted, as a fact which is not without significance, that the losses by submarine which had reached their highest mark in the last week in April began from that time steadily to diminish.  One of the main duties of the Navy was to convoy transports and supplies across the Atlantic. This was done with the assistance of Allied vessels with remarkable success. For a long period it seemed as if the U-boats would not be able to penetrate through the Allied convoy, but during 1918 four transports were torpedoed. The first was the Tuscania which was sunk in February off the north coast of Ireland, with 1,912 officers and men of the Michigan and Wisconsin guardsmen, of whom 204 were lost. The Oronsa, which was torpedoed in April, contained 250 men and all were saved except three of the crew. The Moldavia came next with five hundred troops, of whom fifty-five were lost. On September 6th the troopship Persic with 2,800 American soldiers was torpedoed but American destroyers rescued all on board, and the Persic, which was prevented from sinking by its water-tight bulkheads, was afterwards beached.  Several American ships, including the troop transport Mount Vernon, were torpedoed on return trips and a number of the men of their crews were lost, and several naval vessels were lost, including the destroyer Jacob Jones, and the patrol vessel Alcedo. The Cassin was torpedoed, but reached port under its own steam and later returned to service.  In September and October three more American transports were added to the list of American losses. On September 26th the United States steamer Tampa was torpedoed and sank with all on board, losing 118 men. On September 30th the Ticonderoga was also torpedoed, eleven naval officers and 102 enlisted men being lost.  In addition to these submarine losses several ships and a number of men were lost through collision. The United States steamer Westgate was sunk in a collision with the steamer American on October 7th, with the loss of seven men. On October 9th the United States destroyer Shaw lost fifteen men in a collision, though she later succeeded in reaching port. On October 11th the American steamer Otranto was sunk in a collision with the British liner Cashmere. Of seven hundred American soldiers who were on board 365 were lost. At this time about three thousand anti-submarine craft were in operation day and night around the British Isles, and about five thousand working in the open sea. This was what made it possible for the Allies to win the war.  Inasmuch as the illegal use of the submarine by Germany brought America into the war it was extremely appropriate that she should take an active part in the suppression of the submarine menace. The methods which were used in fighting the submarines differed much in different cases. The action of the government in arming merchantmen and in providing them with trained gun crews did much to lower the number of such ships sunk by the U-boats.  The submarine, which had formerly been able to stop the unarmed merchantman and sink him at leisure, after a few combats with an armed merchantman began to be very wary and to depend almost entirely upon his torpedoes. It was not always easy for the submarine to get in a position where her torpedo would be effective, and the merchantman was carefully directed, if attacked, to pursue a ziz-zag irregular course, and at the same time endeavor to hamper the submarine by shooting as near her periscope as possible.  Along the sea coasts and at certain points in the English Channel great nets were used effectively. Submarines, however, toward the end of the war were made sufficiently large to be able to force their way through these nets, and net-cutting devices were also used by them with considerable effect. The best way to destroy the submarines seemed to be in a direct attack by flotillas of destroyers.  By the end of the war the whole process of sinking or destroying submarines had been thoroughly organized. Practically every portion of the seas near Great Britain and France was carefully watched and the appearance of a submarine immediately reported. As the submarine would only travel at a certain well-understood speed during a given time, it was possible to calculate, after the locality of one was known, about how far from that point it would be found at any later period. Destroyers were therefore sent circling around the point where the submarine had been discovered, enlarging their distance from the center every hour. In the course of time the submarine would be compelled to come up for air, and then, if luck were with the destroyer, it might find its foe before it was seen itself. Having discovered the submarine the destroyer immediately endeavored to ram, dropping depth bombs at the point where they supposed the enemy to be.  These bombs were so constructed that at a certain depth in the water they would explode, and the force of the explosion was so great that even if they did not strike the submarine they would be sure to damage it seriously, sometimes throwing the submarine to the surface partly out of water, and at other times driving her to come to the surface herself ready to surrender.  In many cases it was not necessary to use the depth bomb at all. The gunners on board the destroyers had become extraordinarily expert, and though a shot might destroy the periscope of a submarine without doing much damage, most submarines carrying extra periscopes to use if necessary, yet it was soon found that it was possible by the use of plunging shells to do effective damage. Plunging shells are somewhat similar in their operation to bombs. Such a shell falling just short of a periscope and fused to burst both on contact and at a certain depth was extremely likely to do damage.  In the pursuit of the U-boat the airplane was also extremely effective. These were sent out to patrol large districts near the Allied coast, and also, in some cases, from ships themselves. It is possible in certain weather conditions for the observer on an airplane to detect a submarine even when it is submerged and the airplane can not only attack the submarine by dropping depth bombs, but it can signal at once the location of the enemy to the hurrying destroyers. Indeed, as the submarine warfare proceeded the main difficulty of the Allies was to locate the submarines. Many ingenious devices were used for this purpose, and many of the English vessels had listening attachments under water which were intended to make it possible to hear a submarine as it moved. These, however, do not seem to have been very effective. The submarine itself seems at times to have been fitted out in a similar way and to have thus been able to hear the sound of an approaching ship.  Many thrilling reports of naval actions against German submarines were given out officially by the British admiralty from time to time. In most of these cases the submarine was both rammed and attacked by depth bombs. In nearly all of them the only proof of success was the oil and air bubbles which came to the surface.  One interesting encounter was that in which a British submarine sighted a German U-boat, while both were on the surface. The British submarine dived and later was able to pick up the enemy through the periscope and discharge a torpedo in such a way as to destroy the German vessel. When the British submarine arose it found a patch of oil in which Germans were swimming.  Ordinarily, however, a submarine was of little service in a fight against another for the radius of sight from a periscope is so short that it is practically blind so far as another periscope is concerned. This blindness of the submarine was taken advantage of by the Allies in every possible way.  Merchant ships were camouflaged, that is painted in such a way that they could not be easily distinguished at a distance. In the great convoys ships were often hidden by great masses of smoke to prevent a submarine from finding an easy mark. At night all lights were put out or else so shaded as not to be seen by the enemy. The result of these methods was the gradual destruction of the U-boat menace.  In the summer of 1918, while occasionally some ship was lost, the production of new ships was much greater than those that were sunk. During the month of June it was announced that the completion of new tonnage by the Allies had outstripped the losses  by thousands of tons. During this period the United States had attained its full stride in building ships, airplanes and ordnance.   [Illustration: Painting]   \"HAIL COLUMBIA\"   England greets the first American destroyer squadron to arrive in   European waters after the United States entered the war. The British   admiral asked Admiral Sims, who was in command, how long he needed to   refit and get ready for action. He replied \"We are ready now.\"   [Illustration: Painting]   THE DAY\\'S WORK OF UNCLE SAM\\'S DESTROYERS   More than 2,000,000 men were safely landed in France guarded by the   destroyers, ready day or night whenever an enemy submarine threatened   a convoy, as was the case here in a trip over of the Adriatic loaded   with troops. In the foreground is the periscope of the attacking   submarine trying to submerge before she is hit.   Archibald Hurd, the English naval expert, said: \"When the war is over the nation will form some conception of the debt which we owe the American Navy for the manner in which it has co-operated, not only in connection with the convoy system, but in fighting the submarines. If the naval position is improving today, as it is, it is due to the fact that the British and American fleets are working in closest accord, supported by an immense body of skilled workers on both sides of the Atlantic, who are turning out destroyers and other craft for dealing with the submarine, as well as mines and bombs. Some of the finest battleships of the United States Navy are now associated with the British Grand fleet. They are not only splendid fighting ships but they are well officered and manned.\"  On May 13, 1918, in appreciation of some remarks which had been made by Sir Eric Geddes, First Lord of the British Admiralty, Josephus Daniels, the American Secretary of the Navy, addressed a letter to him in the following terms:   \"Your reference to the splendid spirit of co-operation between the navies of our countries, and your warm praise of the officers and men of our navy, have been most grateful to me and to all Americans. The brightest spot in the tragedy of this war is this mutual appreciation of the men in the naval service. Our officers who have returned confirm the statements of Admiral Sims of the courtesies and kindness shown in every way by the admiralty and the officers of the British fleet. I had hoped to have the pleasure of visiting Great Britain and of personally expressing this feeling of mutual working together, but the task here of making ready more and more units for the fleet is a very serious one, and my duty chains me here. The order in all the Navy is \\'Full speed ahead\\' in the construction of destroyers and other craft, and the whole service is keyed up to press this program forward. Therefore I shall not have the pleasure, until this program shall materialize, of a personal acquaintance and a conference which would be of such interest and value.\"   Sir Eric Geddes replied: \"I am exceedingly grateful for your letter. As you know we, all of us here, have great admiration for your officers and men, and for the splendid help they are giving in European waters. Further, we find Admiral Sims invaluable in council and in co-operation. I fully appreciate how onerous your office must be and much though I regret that you do not see your way to visiting this country in the near future, I hope we may some day have the pleasure of welcoming you here.\"  Sir Eric afterward himself visited the United States and his visit was made the occasion of a general expression of the high regard which the United States felt for the splendid assistance which the great British Navy had rendered in convoying its armies across the seas.  Secretary Daniels, in his report of December, 1918, said that American sea forces in European waters comprised 338 vessels, with 75,000 men and officers--a force larger than the entire Navy was before the war began.  From August, 1914, to September, 1918, German submarines sank 7,151,088 deadweight tons of shipping in excess of the tonnage turned out in that period by the allied and neutral nations. That total does not represent the depletion of the fleets at the command of the allied and neutral nations, however, as 3,795,000 deadweight tons of enemy ships were seized in the meantime. Actually, the allied and neutral nations on September 1, 1918, had only 3,362,088 less tons of shipping in operation than in August, 1914.  These details of the shipping situation were issued by the United States Shipping Board along with figures to show that, with American and allied yards under full headway, Europe\\'s danger of being starved by the German submarine was apparently at an end. The United States took the lead of all nations in shipbuilding.  In all, the allied and neutral nations lost 21,404,913 deadweight tons of shipping since the beginning of the war, showing that Germany maintained an average destruction of about 445,000 deadweight tons monthly. During the latter months, however, the sinkings fell considerably below the average, and allied construction passed destruction for the first time in May, 1918.  The losses of the allied and neutral shipping in August, 1918, amounted to 327,676 gross tonnage, of which 176,401 was British and 151,275 allied and neutral, as compared with the adjusted figures for July of 323,772, and 182,524 and 141,248, respectively. British losses from all causes during August were 10,887 tons higher than in June, which was the lowest month since the introduction of unrestricted submarine warfare.  An official statement of the United States Shipping Board, issued September 21, 1918, set forth the following facts:   STATUS OF WORLD TONNAGE, SEPTEMBER 1, 1918 (Germany and Austria excluded)                                      Deadweight                                                            Tons Total losses (allied and neutral)                 August, 1914-September 1, 1918           21,404,913  Total construction (allied and neutral)                 August, 1914-September 1, 1918           14,247,825  Total enemy tonnage captured (to end of 1917)             3,795,000  Excess of losses over gains                               3,362,088  Estimated normal increase in world\\'s tonnage if war had not occurred (based on rate of increase, 1905-1914)                   14,700,000  Net deficit due to war                                   18,062,088   In August, deliveries to the Shipping Board and other seagoing construction in the United States for private parties passed allied and neutral destruction for that month.

(Lloyd\\'s Register.)   The climax to Germany\\'s piratical submarine adventure took place a few days after the armistice, when a mournful procession of shamefaced-looking U-boats sailed between lines of English cruisers to be handed over to the tender mercies of the Allied governments.    CHAPTER XXXVI  CHINA JOINS THE FIGHTING DEMOCRACIES  The circumstances connected with the entrance of the Republic of China into the World War were as follows: On February 4, 1917, the American Minister, Dr. Reinsch, requested the Chinese Government to follow the United States in protesting against the German use of the submarine against neutral ships. On February 9th Pekin made such a protest to Germany, and declared its intention of severing diplomatic relations if the protest were ineffectual. The immediate answer of Germany was to torpedo the French ship Atlas in the Mediterranean on which were over seven hundred Chinese laborers. On March 10th the Chinese Parliament empowered the government to break with Germany. On the same afternoon a reply was received from the German Government to the Chinese protest, of a very mild character. The reply produced a great deal of surprise in China.  A Chinese statesman made this comment on the German change of attitude: \"The troops under Count Waldersee leaving Germany for the relief of Pekin were instructed by the War Lord to grant no quarter to the Chinese. On the other hand, the latter were to be so disciplined that they would never dare look a German in the face again. The whirligig of time brings its own revenge, and today, after the lapse of scarcely seventeen years, we hear the Vossiche Zeitung commenting on the diplomatic rupture between China and Germany, lamenting that even so weak a state as the Far Eastern Republic dares look defiantly at the German nation.\"  The breaking off of relations with Germany led to trouble between the President of the Republic and the Premier. The Premier desired to break off relations without consulting Parliament. The President insisted that Parliament should be consulted, which was actually done. The next move was to declare war, but here the Chinese statesmen hesitated, and their hesitation arose through their feeling toward Japan.  They sympathized with the Allies, but to Chinese eyes Japan has stood for all that Germany, as depicted by its worst enemies, stood for. The Japanese Government was professing friendliness to China, but that profession the Chinese could not reconcile with Japan\\'s action in the Chino-Japanese War, and on many other occasions since that war. In Chinese hearts there was a strong feeling of distrust, fear and hatred for their Japanese neighbor. There were other reasons also why they hesitated to declare war. Indeed the devotion to peace, which is deep-rooted in the nation, would be a sufficient reason in itself.  Moreover, China, like other neutral nations, was a strong center for German propaganda. German consuls and diplomatic officers, who were scholars in Chinese literature and philosophy, and who also had sufficient funds to entertain Chinese officials as they liked to be entertained, were actively endeavoring to influence Chinese statesmen.  The Chinese Government, however, was determined to declare war, and to secure support the Chinese Premier summoned a council of military governors to consider the question. The majority of the conference agreed with the Premier, but a vigorous opposition began to develop. On May 7th the President sent a formal request to Parliament to approve of a declaration of war. Parliament delayed and was threatened by a mob. The Premier was accused of having instigated the riot and support began to gather for Parliament, and an attack was made on the Premier as being willing to sell China.  Day by day the differences between the militants and democrats became more bitter. The question of war was almost lost in the differences of opinion as to the comparative powers of Parliament and the Executive. A demand was made that the Premier resign. He refused to resign and was dismissed from office by the President, who was supported in his action by the Parliament. This was practically a success of the Parliamentary party, when suddenly several of the northern generals and governors declared their independence, and the movement gradually developed into a revolution in favor of the restoration of the Manchu Dynasty. This revolution was finally suppressed.  The Japanese declared themselves, not the enemies, but the protectors of China in terms that suggested the appearance of a Monroe Doctrine for Asia. They pledged themselves not to violate the political independence or territorial integrity of China, and declared strongly in favor of the principle of the open door and equal opportunity.  On August 14th China formally joined the Allies and declared war on Austria and Germany. She took no great part in the war, except to invade the German and Austrian settlements in Tientsin and Hankow, which were taken over by the Chinese authorities. The Chinese officials also seized the Deutsche Asiatiche Bank which had been the financing agent in China for the German Government, and fourteen German vessels which had been interned in Chinese ports. Thousands of Chinese coolies were sent to Europe to work in the Allied interests behind the battle lines, and China has in all respects been faithful to her pledges.  The official war proclamation of China which was signed by President Feng-kuo-chang reviewed China\\'s efforts to induce Germany to modify her submarine policy. It declared that China had been forced to sever relations with Germany and with Austro-Hungary to protect the lives and property of Chinese citizens. It promised that China would respect the Hague Convention, regarding the humane conduct of the war, and asserted that China\\'s object was to hasten peace.  On July 22d Siam officially entered the war and all German and Austrian subjects were interned and German ships seized. The Prince of Songkla, brother of the reigning monarch, declared that natural necessity and moral pressure forced Siam into the war on the side of the Entente. Neutrality had become increasingly difficult, and it had become apparent that freedom and justice in states which were not strong from a military standpoint were not to be secured through the policy of the Central Powers. Sympathy for Belgium and the popular aversion to Teutonic methods had left no doubt as to the duty of Siam. The motive of Siam had a curious fitness, though there was a certain quaintness in her expression of a desire to make, \"the world safe for democracy.\"  The native name of Siam is Muang-Thai, which means the Kingdom of the Free. Siam is about as large as France, and has a population of about eight millions. Its people, who are of many shades of yellowish-brown, have descended into this corner of Asia from the highlands north of Burma and east of Tibet. The tradition among these people was that the further south they descended the shorter they would grow, that when they reached the southern plains they would be no larger than rabbits, and that when they came to the sea they would vanish altogether. As a fact the northern tribes are much taller than the southern.  The original population of the Siamese peninsula was a race of black dwarfs, remnants of whom still dwell in caves and nests of palm leaves, so shy that it is almost impossible to catch a glimpse of them. The literary and religious culture of Siam comes mainly from southern India. Buddhism is the dominant religion, but there are many Mohammedans also.  The accession of Siam to the ranks of the Allies did not make any great difference from a military point of view, but it was another evidence of the general world feeling with regard to the Germans and their encroachments in all parts of the world. Germany had tried its best to keep these nations from participation in the war, but not only had her propaganda failed but the feeling of these Oriental peoples was strongly anti-German. Much of this feeling, it is readily seen from their statements and their private letters, comes from a personal resentment of the boorish attitude of the individual German. By the end of 1918 the Teuton influence in the Orient had completely disappeared.    CHAPTER XXXVII  THE DEFEAT AND RECOVERY OF ITALY  None of the surprises of the World War brought such sudden and stunning dismay to the Entente Allies as the news of the Italian disaster beginning October 24, 1917, and terminating in mid-November. It is a story in which propaganda was an important factor. It taught the Allies the dangers lying in fraternization between opposing armies.  During the summer of 1917 the second Italian army was confronted by Austrian regiments composed largely of war-weary Socialists. During that summer skilful German propagandists operating from Spain had sown the seeds of pacificism throughout Italy. This was made easy by the distress then existing particularly in the villages where food was scanty and complaints against the conduct of the war were numerous. The propaganda extended from the civilian population to the army, and its channel was directed mainly toward the second army encamped along the Isonzo River.  As a consequence of the pacifists\\' preachments both by word of mouth and document, the second army was ready for the friendly approaches that came from the front lines of the Austrians only a few hundred yards away. Daily communication was established and at night the opposing soldiers fraternized generally. The Russian doctrine that an end of the fighting would come if the soldiers agreed to do no more shooting, spread throughout the Italian trenches.  This was all part of a plan carefully mapped out by the German High Command. When the infection had spread, the fraternizing Austrian troops were withdrawn from the front trenches and German shock troops took their places.  On October 24th these troops attacked in force. The Italians in the front line, mistaking them for the friendly Austrians, waved a greeting. German machine guns and rifles replied with a deadly fire, and the great flanking movement commenced. So well had the Germans played their game the Italians lost more than 250,000 prisoners and 2,300 guns in the first week. The attack began in the Julian Alps and continued along the Isonzo southwestward into the plain of Venice. The Italian positions at Tolmino and Plezzo were captured and the whole Italian force was compelled to retreat along a seventy-mile front from the Carnic Alps to the sea. The most important point gained by the enemy in its early assault was the village of Caporetto on the Upper Isonzo where General Cadorna held a great series of dams which could have drained the Isonzo River dry within twelve hours.   [Illustration: Map]   AREA OF THE FLOW AND EBB OF ITALY\\'S MILITARY SUCCESS FROM THE CARSO   PLATEAU TO THE PIAVE LINE.   The Italian retreat at places degenerated into a rout and it was not until the Italians, reinforced by French and British, reached the Piave River, that a stand was finally made. The defeat cost Cadorna his command, and he was succeeded by General Armando Diaz, whose brilliant strategy during the remainder of the war marked him as a national hero and one of the outstanding military geniuses of the war.  The order for a general retreat was issued on October 27th. Poison gas shells rained blindness and death upon the retreating Italians and upon the heroic rear-guards. The city of Udine and its environs were emptied of their inhabitants; and Goritzia, which had been wrested after a desperate effort from the Austrians, was retaken on October 28th.  That the entire Italian army escaped the fate that had come to the Russians at the Masurian Lakes was due mainly to the third army commanded by the Duke of Aosta. During the long running fight, it faced about from time to time and drove the Germans back in bloody encounters.  By November 10th the Italian forces had come to the hastily prepared entrenchments on the west bank of the Piave River. The Austrians and the Germans dug in on the east bank from the village of Susegana in the Alpine foothills to the Adriatic Sea.  Here a long-drawn-out battle was fought, resulting in enormous losses to the Germans and Austrians. By this time reinforcements had come up from the French front and every attempt by the enemy to gain ground met a bloody check. The hardest fighting was on the Asiago Plateau. There, although the Italians were greatly outnumbered, the concentration of their artillery in the hills overlooking the great field completely dominated the situation.  A factor that was of the utmost value in checking the Austrians was the system of lagoon defenses running from the lower Piave to the Gulf of Venice.  From November 13th, when the Austrians in crossing the lower Piave in their headlong rush to Venice were suddenly checked by the Italian lagoon defenses, the entire Gulf of Venice, with its endless canals and marshes, with islands disappearing and reappearing with the tide, was the scene of a continuous battle. A correspondent described the fighting as absolutely without precedent. The Teutons were desperately trying to turn the Italian right wing by working their way around the northern limits of the Venetian Gulf. The Italians inundated the region and sealed all the entrances into the gulf by mine fields. The gulf, therefore, was converted into an isolated sea. Over this inland waterway the conflict raged bitterly. The Italians had a \"lagoon fleet\" ranging from the swiftest of motor boats, armed with machine guns, small cannon, and torpedo tubes, to huge, cumbersome, flat-bottomed British monitors, mounting the biggest guns.  The Italian vessels navigated secret channels dug in the bottom of the shallow lagoons. Only the Italian war pilots knew these courses. Even gondolas straying out of the channels were instantly and hopelessly stranded. Not only this, but as the muddy flats and marshy islands did not permit of artillery emplacements the Italians developed an immense fleet of floating batteries. The guns ranged from three-inch fieldpieces to great fifteen-inch monsters. Each was camouflaged to represent a tiny island, a garden patch, or a houseboat. Floating on the glasslike surface of the lagoons, the guns fired a few shots and then changed position, making it utterly impossible for the enemy to locate them. The entire auxiliary service of supplying this floating army was adapted to meet the lagoon warfare. Munition dumps were on boats, constantly moved about to prevent the enemy spotting them. Gondolas and motor boats replaced the automobile supply lorries customary in land warfare. Instead of motor ambulances, motor boats carried off the dead and wounded. Hydro-airplanes replaced ordinary fighting aircraft.  Along the northern limit of the Venetian Gulf, where the Austrians, having filtered into the Piave Delta, sought to cross both the Sile and the Piave, the enemy each night hooked up pontoons. At daybreak every morning one end of a huge pontoon structure was anchored to the east bank of the Piave and the other flung out to the strong current, which soon stretched the makeshift bridge across.  The moment this happened, the enemy infantry madly dashed across. Simultaneously the Italian floating batteries opened a terrific fire. Practically every morning the Austrians tried the trick, and every morning they failed, with heavy losses, to effect a crossing. At last they gave up the attempt as hopeless, and the armies remained locked on the Piave for several months.    CHAPTER XXXVIII  REDEMPTION OF THE HOLY LAND  From the beginning of the war the German General Staff and the British War Office planned the occupation of Palestine and Macedonia. Germany wanted domination of that territory because through it lay the open road to Egypt and British prestige in the East. Turkey was the cat\\'s paw of the Hun in this enterprise. German officers and German guns were supplied to the Turks, but the terrible privations necessary in a long campaign that must be spent largely in the desert, and the inevitable great loss in human life, were both demanded from Turkey.  Great Britain made no such demands upon any of its Allies. Unflinchingly England faced virtually alone the rigors, the disease and the deaths consequent upon an expedition having as its object the redemption of the Holy Land from the unspeakable Turk.  Volunteers for the expedition came by the thousands. Canada, the United States, Australia and other countries furnished whole regiments of Jewish youths eager for the campaign. The inspiration and the devotion radiating from Palestine, and particularly from Jerusalem and Bethlehem, drew Jew and Gentile, hardy adventurer and zealous churchman, into Allenby\\'s great army.  It was a long campaign. On February 26, 1917, Kut-el-Amara was recaptured from the Turks by the British expedition under command of General Sir Stanley Maude, and on March 11th following General Maude captured Bagdad. From that time forward pressure upon the Turks was continuous. On September 29, 1917, the Turkish Mesopotamian army commanded by Ahmad Bey was routed by the British, and historic Beersheba in Palestine was occupied on October 31st. The untimely death of General Maude, the hero of Mesopotamia, on November 18, 1917, temporarily cast gloom over the Allied forces but it had no deterrent effect upon their successful operations. Siege was laid to Jerusalem and its environs late in November, and on December 8, 1917, the Holy City which had been held by the Turks for six hundred and seventy-three years surrendered to General Allenby and his British army. Thus ended a struggle for possession of the holiest of shrines both of the Old and New Testaments, that had cost millions of lives during fruitless crusades and had been the center of religious aspirations for ages.   [Illustration: Map: The Jordan river from the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea.]   HOW THE TWO WINGS OF THE BRITISH ARMY TRAPPED THE TURKS.   General Allenby\\'s official report follows:   \"I entered the city officially at noon December 11th with a few of my staff, the commanders of the French and Italian detachments, the heads of the political missions, and the military attaches of France, England, and America.  \"The procession was all afoot, and at Jaffa gate I was received by the guards representing England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Australia, New Zealand, India, France and Italy. The population received me well.  \"Guards have been placed over the holy places. My military governor is in contact with the acting custodians and the Latin and Greek representatives. The governor has detailed an officer to supervise the holy places. The Mosque of Omar and the area around it have been placed under Moslem control, and a military cordon of Mohammedan officers and soldiers has been established around the mosque. Orders have been issued that no non-Moslem is to pass within the cordon without permission of the military governor and the Moslem in charge.\"   A proclamation in Arabic, Hebrew, English, French, Italian Greek and Russian was posted in the citadel, and on all the walls proclaiming martial law and intimating that all the holy places would be maintained and protected according to the customs and beliefs of those to whose faith they were sacred. The proclamation read:   PROCLAMATION  To the Inhabitants of Jerusalem the Blessed and the People Dwelling in Its Vicinity.  The defeat inflicted upon the Turks by the troops under my command has resulted in the occupation of your city by my forces. I, therefore, proclaim it to be under martial law, under which form of administration it will remain so long as military consideration makes necessary.  However, lest any of you be alarmed by reason of your experience at the hands of the enemy who has retired, I hereby inform you that it is my desire that every person should pursue his lawful business without fear of interruption.  Furthermore, since your city is regarded with affection by the adherents of three of the great religions of mankind and its soil has been consecrated by the prayers and pilgrimages of multitudes of devout people of these three religions for many centuries, therefore, do I make it known to you that every sacred building, monument, holy spot, shrine, traditional site, endowment, pious bequest, or customary place of prayer of whatsoever form of the three religions will be maintained and protected according to the existing customs and beliefs of those to whose faith they are sacred.  Guardians have been established at Bethlehem and on Rachel\\'s Tomb. The tomb at Hebron has been placed under exclusive Moslem control.  The hereditary custodians at the gates of the Holy Sepulchre have been requested to take up their accustomed duties in remembrance of the magnanimous act of the Caliph Omar, who protected that church.   Jerusalem was now made the center of the British operations against the Turks in  Palestine. Mohammed V, the Sultan of Turkey, died July 3, 1918, and many superstitious Turks looked upon that event as forecasting the end of the Turkish Empire. The Turkish army in Palestine was left largely to its fate by Germany and Austria, and although it was numerically a formidable opponent for General Allenby\\'s forces, that distinguished strategist fairly outmaneuvered the Turkish High Command in every encounter. The beginning of the end for Turkish misrule in Palestine came on September 20th when the ancient town of Nazareth was captured by the British.  A military net was thereupon closed upon the Turkish army. The fortified towns of Beisan and Afule followed the fate of Nazareth. In one day\\'s fighting 18,000 Turkish prisoners, 120 guns, four airplanes, a number of locomotives and cars, and a great quantity of military and food supplies were bagged by the victorious British. So well did Allenby plan that the British losses were far the smallest suffered in any large operation of the entire war. It was the swiftest and most decisive victory of any scored by the Allies. It ended the grandiose dream of Germany for an invasion of Egypt in stark disaster, and swept the Holy Land clear of the Turks.  This great battle on the Biblical field of Armageddon was remarkable in that it was virtually the only engagement during the entire war offering the freest scope to cavalry operations. British cavalry commands operated over a radius of sixty miles between the Jordan and the Mediterranean, sweeping the Turks before them.  By September 25th the total bag of Turkish prisoners exceeded 40,000. Munition depots covering acres of ground were taken. Whole companies of Turkish soldiers were found sitting on their white flags waiting for the British to accept their terms. Two hundred sixty-five pieces of artillery were captured.  Damascus was captured on Tuesday, October 1st, after an advance of 130 miles by General Allenby since September 1st, the day of his surprise attack north of Jerusalem. During that period a total of 73,000 prisoners was captured.  Palestine\\'s delivery from the Turks was complete. Official announcement was made by the British War Office that the total casualties from all sources in this final campaign was less than 4,000.  Plans for the government of the people of Palestine were announced immediately. Their general scope was outlined in an agreement made between the British, French and Russian governments in 1916. Under that arrangement Republican France was charged with the preparation of a scheme of self-government. The town of Alexandretta was fixed upon as a free port of entry for the new nation.

Following the custom of the Crusaders, General Allenby, commander of   the British and Allied forces, made his entry, with his staff and   Allied officers, through the Jaffa Gate, on foot.

ANCIENT AND MODERN WARFARE MINGLE IN THE HOLY LAND   The distinctly modern British soldier uses the camel, that extremely   ancient beast of burden, to get him over the desert in Palestine. The   Imperial Camel Corps gave valuable service in the campaign that led to   the capture of Jerusalem.    CHAPTER XXXIX  AMERICA\\'S TRANSPORTATION PROBLEMS  When America entered the war there was a very great increase in the volume of business of the railroads of the country. The roads were already so crowded by what the Allies had done in purchasing war supplies, that a great deal of confusion had resulted. The Allies had expended more than three billion dollars in the United States, and as nearly all of their purchases had to be sent to a few definite points for shipment to Europe, the congestion at those points had become a serious difficulty. Thousands of loaded cars had to stand for long periods awaiting the transfer of their contents to ships. This meant that thousands of cars which had been taken from lines in other parts of the country would be in a traffic blockade for weeks at a time. The main difficulty appeared to be that of getting trains unloaded promptly.  The declaration of war by the United States made the situation very much worse. Not only did the railroads have to handle the freight destined for the Allies, but there was a very large addition to the passenger movement on account of the thousands of men that were being sent to the various training camps, and the immense masses of supplies that had to be sent to these camps. This included not only the ordinary supplies to the men but thousands of carloads of lumber. Moreover, all over the country mills and factories were now being handed over to the government for war work; and to them, too, great quantities of raw material had to be sent, and the finished product removed to its destination.  A vigorous endeavor to meet the new difficulties was instituted by the railroads themselves. They themselves named a war board, which was to co-operate with the government and which was to have absolute authority. But this arrangement soon proved unsatisfactory. Each government official would do his best to obtain preference for what his department required, and to obtain that preference a system of priority tags was established which became a great abuse. The result was that priority freight soon began to crowd out the freight which the railroads could handle according to their own discretion, thus seriously interfering with business all over the country.  Naturally, the railroad executives and the government authorities studied the question with the greatest care, but they could not reach an understanding among themselves, nor with the Administration. At last the President settled the matter by announcing his decision to have the government take over complete control of the roads. The President derived his power from an Act of Congress dated August 29, 1916, which reads as follows:   The President in time of war is empowered, through the Secretary of War, to take possession and assume control of any system or systems of transportation, or any part thereof, and to utilize the same to the exclusion, as far as may be necessary, of all other traffic thereon, for the transfer or transportation of troops, war material and equipment, or for such other purposes connected with the emergency as may be needful or desirable.   The proclamation went into effect on December 28, 1917, and the President declared that it applied to \"each and every system of transportation and the appurtenances thereof, located, wholly or in part, within the boundaries of the Continental United States, and consisting of railroads and owned or controlled systems of coastwise and inland transportation, engaged in general transportation, whether operated by steam, or by electric power, including also terminals, terminal companies, and terminal associations, sleeping and parlor cars, private cars, and private car lines, elevators, warehouses, telegraph and telephone lines, and all other equipment and appurtenances commonly used upon or operated as a part of such rail or combined rail and water systems of transportation.... That the possession, control, operation, and utilization of such transportation systems shall be exercised by and through William G. McAdoo, who is hereby appointed, and designated Director General of Railroads. Said Director may perform the duties imposed upon him so long and to such an extent as he shall determine through the boards of directors, receivers, officers and employees, of said system of transportation.\" President Wilson issued an explanation with this proclamation in which he said:   This is a war of resources no less than of men, perhaps even more than of men, and it is necessary for the complete mobilization of our resources that the transportation systems of the country should be organized and employed under a single authority and to simplify methods for coordination which have not proved possible under private management and control. A committee of railway executives who have been cooperating with the government in this all-important matter, have done the utmost that it was possible for them to do, but there were differences that they could neither escape nor neutralize. Complete unity of administration in the present circumstances involves upon occasion, and at many points, a serious dislocation of earnings, and the committee was, of course, without power or authority to rearrange charges or effect proper compensations in adjustments of earnings. Several roads which were willingly and with admirable public spirit accepting the orders of the committee, have already suffered from these circumstances, and should not be required to suffer further. In mere fairness to them, the full authority of the government must be substituted. The public interest must be first served, and in addition the financial interests of the government, and the financial interests of the railways, must be brought under a common direction. The financial operations of the railway need not, then, interfere with the borrowings of the government, and they themselves can be conducted at a great advantage. Investors in railway securities may rest assured that their rights and interests will be as scrupulously looked after by the government as they could be by the directors of the several railway systems. Immediately upon the reassembling of Congress I shall recommend that these different guarantees be given. The Secretary of War and I are agreed that, all the circumstances being taken into consideration, the best results can be obtained under the immediate executive direction of the Honorable William G. McAdoo, whose practical experience peculiarly fits him for the service, and whose authority as Secretary of the Treasury will enable him to coordinate, as no other man could, the many financial interests which will be involved, and which might, unless systematically directed, suffer very embarrassing entanglements.   President Wilson\\'s proclamation stirred up great excitement on the stock market. Speculators rushed to buy back railroad stocks which they had previously sold short, and the market value of such stocks was raised more than three hundred and fifty million dollars as a result. The Federal Government\\'s assumption of control of the railroads was generally recognized as the proper act under existing circumstances, and the guarantee of pre-war earnings made them a good investment.  The railroad system in the United States consists of 260,000 miles of railroad, owned by 441 distinct corporations, with about 650,000 shareholders. It employs 1,600,000 men and represents a property investment of $17,500,000,000. The outstanding capital in round numbers is $16,000,000,000, $9,000,000,000 of which is represented by a funded debt. The rolling stock comprises 61,000 locomotives, 2,250,000 freight cars, 52,000 passenger cars and 95,000 service cars. All this was now under the charge of William G. McAdoo. On January 4, 1918, President Wilson explained his plan to Congress, and recommended legislation to put the new system of control into effect, and to guarantee to the holders of railroad stocks and bonds a net annual income equal to the average net income for the three years ending June 30, 1917.  The wise recommendations of President Wilson were at once approved by Congress; provision was made for guaranteeing the railroads the income which he recommended, and for financing the roads. The railroads\\' war board was abolished and Mr. McAdoo appointed an advisory board to assist him. This board consisted of John Skelton Williams, Controller of the Currency; Hale Holden, President of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad; Henry Walters, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Atlantic Coast Line; Edward Chambers, Vice-President of the Santa Fe Railroad and head of the transportation division of the United States Food Administration; Walter D. Hines, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Santa Fe. Specific duties were assigned to the various members of this committee. Mr. Williams was to deal with the financial problem; Mr. Holden to assume direction of committees and sub-committees, and other phases of the work were allotted to other members. Mr. Walter D. Hines was made assistant to the Director General.  Mr. McAdoo\\'s first order was to pool all terminals, ports, locomotives, rolling stock and other transportation facilities. Another order had as its object to end the congestion of traffic in New York City and Chicago. It gave all lines entering these centers equal rights in trackage and water terminal facilities. This wiped out the identity of the great Pennsylvania Terminal Station in New York, and gave all railroads the use of the Pennsylvania tubes under the Hudson River.  The effect of government control of the railroads was felt from the very first. Coal was given the right of way, giving great relief to such sections as were suffering from fuel shortage. Many passenger trains were taken off, more than two hundred and fifty of such trains being dropped from the schedules of the eastern roads. This permitted a great increase in the freight traffic. Orders were also given that all empty box cars were to be sent to wheat-producing centers, so that wheat could be moved to the Atlantic sea coasts for shipment to England and France. These orders preceded the adoption of the railroad control bill, which was not passed by Congress until March 14th. A feature of the bill is the proviso that government control of the railroads shall not continue more than twenty-one months after the war. After the passing of the bill plans were made to make contracts with each railroad company for government compensation on the basis provided in the bill.  The action of the government in thus assuming control of the railroads very naturally led to wide differences of opinion, some of which were sharply expressed in the Congress of the United States. On the whole, however, public opinion decided that the government acted wisely. Certain inconveniences to the traveling public were easily excused when it was realized that the movement of troops throughout the country to the camps, or from the camps to the ports which were to take them across the sea, from \"Texas to Toul,\" was being accomplished with great success; that the movement of war material was now possible, and that the gigantic railroad system was working without a hitch.  Many details, in connection with the railroad management, were not at once worked out, and many months passed without complete agreements regarding the railway operating contracts. But this was a matter of greater interest to the owners than it was to patriotic citizens, anxious for the winning of the war. Governmental control of the railroads, was only a beginning. On July 16th President Wilson took control, for the period of the war, of all telegraph, telephone, cable and radio lines, signing a bill on that day passed by Congress authorizing such action.  The transportation of the American army across the ocean was the greatest military feat of its kind ever accomplished in history. The transportation of English troops during the Boer War meant a longer journey, but the number of troops sent on that journey was but a small fraction of America\\'s army.  The railroads in existence were not sufficient. The ships that were necessary could not be found in America\\'s navy. It was necessary to build new roads, new docks, new terminals, new bases of supplies in America, and to send abroad thousands of trained workmen and experienced railroad engineers to build similar necessities in France. To convey the millions of men across the water England had to come to the rescue, and though hundreds of American ships were built with a speed that was almost miraculous, they were in constant need of the assistance of the Allies. But wonderful men were put in charge of the work, wonderful organizers with wonderful assistants, and the great task was accomplished.  As soon as the army was trained it was sent across--first by thousands, then by tens of thousands, then by hundreds of thousands, until before the war was over more than two million men had made the great trip \"over there.\" And throughout that whole trip they were watched over as carefully as if they were at home. Every want was supplied; food, clothing, munitions were all where they were needed. Even their leisure hours were looked after, their health attended to. Books, games, theaters, classes for those who cared to study, all were there.  It was a wonderful performance, and the whole movement was conducted with clock-like precision. On such a day at such an hour the trained soldier would start. At such an hour he would report in some Atlantic port. At such an hour and such a minute he would board ship, and with equal precision that ship would sail upon the appointed moment. Perhaps on the journey over some submarine might delay the ship, but the destroyers were there on the alert, and the submarine was but an amusing episode. On the other side the process was carried on with equal efficiency. Before the American doughboy could realize that he was in France he was in his quarters, just like home, in the base camps behind the fighting line and it was this miracle of transportation that won the war.  A study of transportation construction in other countries showed that actual construction of railroads had been suspended in some cases, and in others retarded, but in not a few instances hastened by the war. Brazil experienced a more nearly complete suspension of railroad building than any of the other countries, but preparation was made for prompt resumption of construction, with the return of more normal conditions.  The Chinese building program also had been affected unfavorably by the war. Nevertheless, there were important additions made, aggregating approximately 800 miles during the war. Of the lines completed in 1917, two are of especial significance. One of these, a 140-mile section of the Canton-Hankow line, a link in the route between South China and Peking. The other is a 60-mile feeder of the Trans-Siberian Railway in Manchuria. A line was extended from South Manchuria into Mongolia, the first railroad to penetrate this territory. Financial arrangements were made for the early construction of a line across Southern Manchuria and for another connecting the Peking-Hankow and Tientsin-Pukow lines.  Construction in Siberia proceeded rapidly. The completion, in 1915, of the Amur River division of the Trans-Siberian in the east, together with the extension in 1913 of the Ekaterinburg-Tiumen line to Omsk in the west, gave virtually a double track from European Russia to Vladivostok.  The notable achievement in Africa was the continuation of the southern rail link in the Cape-to-Cairo route. This line was completed to Bukama on the navigable Congo, 2,600 miles from Capetown. The railway in German East Africa, was extended to Lake Tanganyika on the eve of the war, making a rail-water line across the center of the continent. The railroad from Lobito Bay was extended eastward to Katanga, a rich mineral region of the Belgian Congo, and, with the road already reaching the Indian Ocean at Beira, gave a second east and west transcontinental line. A permanent standard gauge railroad was laid by the British Expeditionary Forces from Egypt into Palestine.  Despite the magnitude of the Australian contribution to the Allied military and naval forces, the east and west transcontinental railway, begun in 1912, was completed in 1917. In all, more than 3,500 miles of track were built in the commonwealth in the years 1915-17.  In Canada, the work of providing two transcontinental railroads was completed; feeders were added, and a line from La Pas to Hudson Bay was under construction. From 1912 to 1916 more than 10,000 miles of track were put in operation, nearly 7,000 of which were added in the first two years of the war.    CHAPTER XL  SHIPS AND THE MEN WHO MADE THEM.  When the United States of America entered the World War she was confronted at once by a serious question. The great Allied nations were struggling against the attempt of the Germans, through the piratical use of submarines, to blockade the coast of the Allied countries. It was this German action which had led America to take part in the war. It is true that America had other motives. Few wars ever take place among democratic nations as a result of the calculation of the nation\\'s leaders. The people must be interested, and the people must sympathize with the cause for which they are going to fight. The people of America had sympathized with Belgium, and had become indignant at the brutal treatment of that inoffensive nation. They had sympathized with France in its gallant endeavor to protect its soil from the inroads of the Hun. This feeling had become a personal one as they reviewed the lists of Americans lost in the sinking of the Lusitania, and this sympathy had gradually grown into indignation when the Germans, after having promised to conduct submarine warfare according to international law, again and again violated that promise. When, then, the Germans declared that they would no longer even pretend to treat neutral shipping according to the laws of maritime warfare the people with one accord approved the action of the President of the United States in declaring war. The Germans at this time were making a desperate effort to starve England, by destroying its commerce, and it was in the endeavor to accomplish this purpose that they thought it necessary to attack American ships.  The first effort of Americans, therefore, was naturally to use every power of the navy to destroy the lurking submarines, and in the second place to use every means in their power to supply the Allies with food. But America had for many years neglected to give encouragement to her merchant fleets. Her commerce was very largely carried in foreign bottoms.  Ships were needed, and needed urgently, and one of the very first acts of the American Government was to authorize their production. Congress therefore appropriated for this purpose what was then the extraordinary sum of $1,135,000,000 and General Goethals, recently returned from his work in building the Panama Canal, was appointed manager of the Emergency Fleet Corporation and entrusted with the execution of the government\\'s ship-building program.  The Emergency Fleet Corporation, however, was then independent of the United States Shipping Board, of which Mr. William Denman was made chairman, and friction between General Goethals and Mr. Denman at the very start caused long delay. The difference of opinion between them arose over the comparative merits of wooden and steel ships. The matter was finally laid before President Wilson and ended in the resignation of both men and the complete reorganization of the board and the Fleet Corporation, in which reorganization the Fleet Corporation was made subordinate to the Shipping Board but given entire control of construction.  Rear-Admiral Capps succeeded General Goethals, but was compelled to resign on account of ill health. Rear-Admiral Harris, who had been chief of the Navy\\'s Bureau of Yards and Docks, then had the job for two weeks, but resigned because in his opinion he had not enough authority. Then came Mr. Charles Piez, who held the position for a longer period. Mr. Edward N. Hurley had been made chairman of the United States Shipping Board, and under the direction of these two men much progress was made.  In the spring of 1918 the boards themselves were not satisfied with their progress, and on April 16, 1918, Mr. Charles M. Schwab, chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, was made Director General of the Emergency Fleet Corporation. Mr. Schwab was one of the most prominent business men in the United States and one of the best known, and his appointment was received all over the country with the greatest satisfaction. His wonderful work in building up the Bethlehem steel plant not only showed his great ability, but especially fitted him for a task in which the steel industry bore such a vital part. The official statement issued from the White House read as follows:   Edward N. Hurley, Charles M. Schwab, Bainbridge Colby and Charles Piez were received by the President at the White House today. It was stated that the subject discussed was the progress and condition of a national ship-building program. The carrying forward of the construction work in the one hundred and thirty shipyards now in operation is so vast that it requires a reinforcement of the ship-building organization throughout the country. Later in the day Chairman Hurley of the Shipping Board announced that a new office with wide powers had been created by the Trustees of the Emergency Fleet Corporation. The new position is that of Director General and Mr. Schwab has been asked, and has agreed, to accept this position in answer to the call of the nation. Charles Piez, Vice-President of the Emergency Fleet Corporation, recommended that the post of General Manager of the corporation be at once abolished, so that Mr. Schwab as Director General should be wholly unhampered in carrying on the large task entrusted to him. Mr. Piez, since the retirement of Admiral Harris, has been filling both the position of Vice-President and that of General Manager. Mr. Schwab will have complete supervision and direction of the work of ship-building. He agreed to take up the work at the sacrifice of his personal wishes in the matter. His services were virtually commandeered. His great experience as a steel maker and builder of ships has been drafted for the nation.   Although the fact that production during the month of March had not been as great as had been hoped probably brought about this change, it should also be said that those who had been responsible deserved much credit for what had actually been done. They had been handicapped constantly by poor transportation and shortage of materials, but had worked faithfully and with what under ordinary circumstances would be regarded as remarkable success. The call upon Mr. Schwab was simply an effort to draft into the service of the country its very highest executive ability. Mr. Schwab\\'s name had been mentioned before for more than one government post, and it was thought that here was the place where his talents could have the fullest play. It was stated in Washington that he would receive a salary of one dollar a year.  Mr. Schwab at once proceeded to \"speed up\" the shipping-program. It took him just one day to arrange his own business affairs and then he began his work. His first day was spent in going over the details of his task with Chairman Hurley and Mr. Piez. He then received newspaper men, beginning the campaign of publicity which turned out to be so successful. He was full of compliments for the work which had already been done. \"It is prodigious, splendid, magnificent!\" he said. \"It is far greater than any man who hasn\\'t seen the inside of things can appreciate. The foundation is laid. That task is well done. We are going to get the results which are needed and I should be proud if I could have any part in the accomplishment. All I can say for myself is that I am filled with enthusiasm, energy and confidence. Mr. Hurley and I are in full accord on everything, and we are going to work shoulder to shoulder to make the work a success, but the large burden must fall upon the people at the yards, and they are entitled to any credit for success. I do not want to have any man in the shipyards working for me. I want them all working with me. Nothing is going to be worth while unless we win this war, and everyone must do the task to which he is called.\"  One of the first steps that Mr. Schwab took to speed up ship production was to establish his headquarters in Philadelphia, as the center of the ship-building region. Chairman Hurley remained at Washington, and the operating department, which included agencies such as the Inter-Allied Ship Control Committee, was removed to New York City. It was stated that nearly fifty per cent of the work in progress was within a short radius of Philadelphia.  The year before the war the total output of the United States shipyards was only two hundred and fifty thousand tons. The program of the shipping board contemplated the construction of one thousand one hundred and forty-five steel ships, with a tonnage of eight million one hundred and sixty-four thousand five hundred and eight, and four hundred and ninety wooden ships, with a tonnage of one million seven hundred and fifteen thousand. These of course could not be built in the shipyards then in existence. New shipyards had to be built in various parts of the country.  In the first year after the shipping board took control, one hundred and eighty-eight ships were put in the water and through requisition and by building, one hundred and three more were added to the American merchant fleet. By April, 1918, the government had at its service 2,762,605 tons of shipping. During the month of May, the first month after Mr. Schwab began his work, the record of production had mounted from 160,286 tons to 263,571. American shipyards had completed and delivered during that month forty-three steel ships and one wooden ship. Mr. Hurley, in an address on June 10th, said:   On June 1st, we had increased the American built tonnage to over 3,500,000 dead-weight tons of shipping. This gives us a total of more than one thousand four hundred ships with an approximate total deadweight tonnage of 7,000,000 now under the control of the United States Shipping Board. In round numbers and from all sources we have added to the American flag since our war against Germany began, nearly 4,500,000 tons of shipping. Our program calls for the building of 1,856 passenger, cargo and refrigerator ships and tankers, ranging from five thousand to twelve thousand tons each, with an aggregate dead-weight of thirteen million. Exclusive of these we have two hundred and forty-five commandeered vessels, taken over from foreign and domestic owners which are being completed by the Emergency Fleet Corporation. These will aggregate a total dead-weight tonnage of 1,715,000. This makes a total of two thousand one hundred and one vessels, exclusive of tugs and barges which are being built and will be put on the seas in the course of carrying out the present program, with an aggregate dead-weight tonnage of 14,715,000. Five billion dollars will be required to finish our program, but the expenditure of this enormous sum will give to the American people the greatest merchant fleet ever assembled in the history of the world. American workmen have made the expansion of recent months possible, and they will make possible the successful conclusion of the whole program.   In the wonderful work that followed his appointment Mr. Schwab constantly came before the public, mainly through his addresses to the working men of the different yards. His main endeavor was to stimulate enthusiasm and rivalry among the men. A ten-thousand-dollar prize was offered to the yard producing the largest surplus above its program, and he traveled throughout the country urging the employees at all the great yards to break their records. The result of his work was that it was not long before it was announced that the monthly tonnage of ships completed by the Allies exceeded the tonnage of those sunk by the German submarine. The menace of the submarine, which had seemed so formidable, had disappeared.  The most important of the great shipyards which were producing the American cargo ships was at Hog Island in the southwest part of Philadelphia. This shipyard may indeed be called the greatest shipyard in the world. Before Mr. Schwab became Director General much criticism had been launched at the work that was going on there, and an investigation had been made which resulted in a favorable report. On August 5th the new shipyard launched its first ship, the 7,500 ton freight steamer, Quistconck, in the presence of a distinguished throng among whom were the President of the United States and Mrs. Woodrow Wilson. The ship was christened by Mrs. Wilson, and the President swung his hat and led the cheers as the great ship glided down the ways. The name \"Quistconck\" is the ancient Indian name of Hog Island. The crowd numbered more than sixty thousand people, and special trains from Washington and New York brought many notable guests. President and Mrs. Wilson were escorted by Mr. Hurley and Mr. Schwab, and apparently thoroughly enjoyed the occasion. An enormous bouquet was presented to Mrs. Wilson by Foreman McMillan, who had driven the first rivet in the Quistconck\\'s keel.  Shortly after the armistice it was announced that the Hog Island plant would be acquired by the United States Government. The real estate, valued at $1,760,000, was owned by the American International Ship Building Company, and the government had invested about $60,000,000 in equipping the plant. At the time the war ended thirty-five thousand persons were at work and a hundred and eighty ships were in various stages of completion.  An interesting feature in connection with the endeavor to \"speed up\" was the competition in riveting. Early in the year in yard after yard expert riveters were reported as making extraordinary records, and prizes were offered to the winners of such records. Later, however, such contests were discouraged by Chairman Hurley and by others. The best record was made by John Omir, who drove twelve thousand two hundred and nine rivets in nine hours at the Belfast Yards of Workman and Clark. In the accomplishment of this feat on two occasions he passed the mark of one thousand four hundred rivets an hour. In his best minute he drove twenty-six rivets.  The ships constructed by the Shipping Board were of steel, of wood and of concrete, and at times considerable difference of opinion existed with regard to which form of ship should receive the most attention. The policy of the government seemed finally to favor the steel as it was claimed that the wooden type was not only more expensive, but that it was less efficient. However until the very end wooden ships in great numbers were being built.  On May 31st the steamship Agawam, described as the first fabricated ship in the world, was launched in the yards of the Submarine Boat Corporation at Newark. This was essentially a standardized steel cargo ship. \"Fabricated\" is the technical term applied to ships built from numbered shapes made from patterns.  President Carse, of the Submarine Boat Corporation, said that the Agawam was the first of a hundred and fifty vessels of that type which would be constructed in the yard. The parts were made, he said, in bridge and tank shops throughout the country and were assembled at the yard. \"Ninety-five per cent of the work in forming the parts entering into the hull of this vessel, and punching rivet holes, is done at shops widely separated, from drawings furnished by this company, and these drawings have been of such exactitude, and the work has been so carefully performed by the different bridge shops that when they are brought together at this yard they fit perfectly and the ship as you see is absolutely fair. The construction of the hull of this vessel requires the driving of over four hundred thousand rivets, and by our method more then one quarter of these rivets are driven at the distant shops, the different parts being brought to the yard in sections as large as can be transported on the railroad. Each part is numbered and lettered and as they are shaped perfectly all that is necessary is to place them in position, bolt them, and finally fasten them with rivets.\"  Officials of the company said that they expected to launch in the course of time two such vessels in each week. A standard ship of this type has a dead-weight carrying capacity of five thousand five hundred tons. It is three hundred and forty-three feet long and forty-six feet wide and is expected to show an average speed of ten and a half knots. Fuel oil is used to generate steam, to drive a turbine operating three thousand, six hundred revolutions a minute. The oil is carried in compartments of the double bottom of the ship in sufficient quantity for more than a round trip to Europe. Twenty-seven steel mills, fifty-six fabricating plants, and two hundred foundries and equipment shops were drawn upon to construct the ship.  In addition to the steel and wood vessels the Emergency Fleet Corporation also constructed a number of concrete ships. The first step in this direction was taken on April 3d, when the construction of four 7,500-ton concrete ships at a Pacific coast shipyard was authorized. This action was taken as a result of a report on the trials made with the concrete ship, Faith, which was built in San Francisco by private capital. The test of this ship had been satisfactory and Mr. R. J. Wig, an agent of the Emergency Fleet Corporation, who had made a careful inspection of the Faith and watched the tests, reported his confidence in the new cargo carrier. The successful trial trip of the Faith led, on the 17th of May, to the government order that fifty-eight mere such ships be constructed. Sites for yards were leased and contracts awarded. The concrete ship turned out to be a great success.  The extraordinary success of the American ship-building program during the World War was due to the enthusiasm of the workmen employed at the government plants, and that same enthusiasm was found in connection with their work in every industry on which the Government made demands. American labor was thoroughly loyal. It recognized that in the war for democracy against autocracy it had a vital concern. The attitude of the great American labor unions must however be sharply distinguished from that of the extreme socialists who refused to take any part in helping to win the war.  From the very beginning, the American Federation of Labor took a patriotic stand. Its leader was Mr. Samuel Gompers, and it was fortunate for America that the leadership of this great organization was in such patriotic hands. Mr. Gompers had been for many years president of this great labor organization, and was so often called in consultation by the President of the United States in connection with labor affairs that he might almost be called an unofficial member of the President\\'s cabinet. Mr. Gompers was by birth an Englishman, but he had left his home when still a boy and was thoroughly filled with true American patriotism. From the beginning he devoted himself with the greatest enthusiasm not only to the protection of the interests of which he was in charge, but to the prosecution of a successful war. He had to contend, as labor leaders in other countries had been compelled to contend, with socialistic and anarchistic organizations.  During the period of America\\'s participation in the war there were certain disturbances caused by the I. W. W., but from such movements the American Federation of Labor held itself aloof. Occasional strikes, on account of special conditions, were easily settled. The governmental assumption of control over railroads and other essential industries had much to do with the peaceful attitude of the workmen. The very high wages which were offered to the workmen at munitions works, ship-building plants and other governmental enterprises enabled the workmen there to live in reasonable comfort, though it caused a great deal of trouble in private industry, and compelled an increase in pay to labor all over the land.  In the latter part of the war Mr. Gompers traveled abroad, as a representative of American labor, and was greeted everywhere with the utmost enthusiasm, while his influence was strongly felt in favor of moderate and sane views as to labor\\'s rights.  The American situation with regard to labor was made much simpler by the organization of the United States Employment Service. This was made an arm of the Department of Labor, with branch offices in nearly all the large cities of every state. It had a large corps of traveling examiners, men skilled in determining the fitness of workers for particular jobs, and it undertook to recruit labor for the various war industries in which they were needed. During the last year of the war from a hundred and fifty thousand to two hundred thousand workers of all kinds were given work each month. In addition to this the Employment Service was a clearing house of information for manufacturers. The Director General of this service was Mr. John B. Densmore.  Labor throughout the country, except when influenced by men of foreign birth who were not in touch with the spirit of America, was universally loyal, and its share in the winning of the war will always remain a matter for pride.    [Illustration: Photograph]   THE GREATEST SHIPYARD IN THE WORLD   View of Hog Island shipyard near Philadelphia, showing the forest of   derricks rising from its fifty shipways. At the time the war ended,   35,000 persons were at work and 180 ships were in course of   completion.   [Illustration: Painting]   THE LARGEST SHIP IN THE WORLD AS A U. S. TRANSPORT   Among the German ships taken over by the United States at the outbreak   of the war was the \"Vaterland,\" the largest ship ever built. She was   renamed the \"Leviathan\" and used as a transport, carrying 12,000   American soldiers past the submarines on each trip. She is shown here   entering a French harbor at the end of a passage.    CHAPTER XLI  GERMANY\\'S DYING DESPERATE EFFORT  In the spring of 1918 it must have been plain to the German High Command that if the war was to be won it must be won at once. In spite of all their leaders said of the impossibility of bringing an American army to France they must have been well informed of what the Americans were doing. They knew that there were already more than two million men in active training in the American army, and while at that time only a small proportion of them were available on the battle front, yet every day that proportion was growing greater and by the middle of the summer the little American army would have become a tremendous fighting force.  Their own armies on their western front had been enormously increased in size by the removal to that front of troops from Russia. Hundreds of thousands of their best regiments were now withdrawn from the east and incorporated under the command of their great Generals, Hindenburg and Ludendorf, in the armies of the west. They must, therefore, take advantage of this increased force and win the war before the Americans could come.  The problem of the Allies was also simple. It was not necessary for them to plan a great offensive. All they had to do was to hold out until, through the American aid which was coming now in such numbers, their armies would be so increased that German resistance would be futile. Under such circumstances began the last great offensive of the German army.  At that time it seems probable that the armies of Great Britain and France numbered about three million five hundred thousand men, and that, of these, six hundred and seventy thousand were on the front lines when the German attack began, leaving an army of reserve of about two million eight hundred and fifty thousand men. A considerable number of these were probably in England on leave. The number of French soldiers must have been between four and five million, of whom about one million five hundred thousand were on the front line. Adding to these the American, Belgian, Portuguese, Russian and Polish troops the Allied forces could not have been short of eight million five hundred thousand men.   [Illustration: Map: Lens on the North, St. Quentin on the East, Soissons on the South, Amiens on the West.]   HOW GERMANY ATTEMPTED TO DIVIDE THE ALLIED ARMIES   The map shows the ground covered by the Germans in the terrific   Picardy drive of March, 1918, which had for its object the capture of   Amiens and the push forward along the Somme to the channel, thus   dividing the British army in the north from the French and Americans   in the south.   The strength of the Germans on the western front before the Russian Revolution was probably about four million five hundred thousand men, and the withdrawal of Russia from the war had added to that number probably as many as one million five hundred thousand men, making an army of six million men to oppose that of the Allies. The Allies, therefore, must have considerably outnumbered the Germans.  In spite of this fact in nearly all the engagements in the early part of the great offensive the Allied forces were outnumbered in a ratio varying from three to one to five to three. This was possible, first, because in any offensive the attacking side naturally concentrates as many troops as it can gather at the point from which the offense is to begin, and second, since the Allies were not under one command it was with great difficulty that arrangements could be made by which the forces of one nation could reinforce the armies of another.  The first difficulty of course could not be obviated, but the solution of the second difficulty was the appointment of General Foch as Commander-in-Chief of all the Allied forces.  The appointment was made on March 28th and all the influence of the United States had been exerted in its favor. General Pershing at once offered to General Foch the unrestricted use of the American force in France and it was agreed that a large part of the American army should be brigaded with the Allied troops wherever there were weak spots.  Foch was already famous as the greatest strategist in Europe. He comes of a Basque family and was born in the town of Tarbes, in the Department of the Hautes-Pyrenees, which is on the border of Spain, on October 2, 1851. Foch served as a subaltern in the Franco-Prussian War and at twenty-six was made captain in the artillery. Later he became Professor of Tactics in the Ecole de Guerre, where he remained for five years. He then returned to regimental work and won steady promotion until he became brigadier-general. He was sent back to the War College as Director and wrote two books, \"The Principles of War\" and \"Conduct of War,\" which have been translated into English, German and Italian and are considered standard works. He was now recognized as a man of unusual ability and was appointed to the command first, of the Thirteenth division, then of the Eighth corps at Bourges, and then to the command of the Twentieth corps at Nancy.  Unlike Marshal Joffre who was cool, careful, slow moving, Marshal Foch is full of daring and impetuosity. Everything is calculated scientifically but his strategy is full of dash. Many of his sayings have been passed from mouth to mouth among the Allies.  \"Find out the weak point of your enemy and deliver your blow there,\" he said once at a staff banquet.  \"But suppose, General,\" said an officer, \"that the enemy has no weak point?\" \"If the enemy has no weak point,\" replied the Commander, \"make one.\"  It was he who telegraphed to Joffre during the first battle of the Marne: \"The enemy is attacking my flank. My rear is threatened. I am therefore attacking in front.\"  Foch is a great student, an especial admirer of Napoleon, whose campaigns he had thoroughly studied. Even the campaigns of Caesar he had found valuable and had gathered from them practical suggestions for his own campaigns. He is the hero of the Marne, the man who on September 9th marched his army between Von Bulow and Von Hausen\\'s Saxons, drove the Prussian Guards into the marshes of St. Gond and forced both Prussians and Saxons into their first great retreat. Later his armies fought on the Yser while the British were battling at Ypres. During the battle of the Somme he was on the English right pressing to Peronne.  For a time he became Chief of the French Staff, until he was called into the field again to his great command. Foch was one of those French officers who had felt that war was sure to come, and had constantly urged that France should be kept in a state of preparedness. The appointment of General Foch to the Supreme Command was largely the result of American urgency.  General March, the American Chief of Staff, in one of his weekly announcements, stated: \"One of the most striking things noticeable in the situation as it is shown on the western front is the supreme importance of having a single command. The acceptance of the principle of having a single command, which was advocated by the President of the United States and carried through under his constant pressure, is one of the most important single military things that has been done as far as the Allies are concerned. The unity of command which Germany has had from the start of the war has been a very important military asset, and we already see the supreme value of having that central command which now has been concentrated in General Foch.\"  General March, who had earlier been appointed Chief of Staff of the United States army, was sending a steady stream of American troops to Europe, a fact whose importance was well understood by the new Commander-in-Chief. On General March\\'s promotion General Foch sent him the following message:   I hear with deep satisfaction of your promotion to the rank of General. I associate myself to the just pride which you must feel in evoking the names of your glorious predecessors, Grant and Sheridan. I convey to you my sincere congratulations and I am happy to see you assume permanently the huge task of Chief of Staff of the United States army which you are already performing in so brilliant a way.   General March replied:   Your message of congratulation upon my promotion to the grade of General Chief of Staff, United States army, was personally conveyed to me by General Vignal, French Military Attache. I appreciate deeply your most kindly greetings and in expressing my most sincere thanks, avail myself of the opportunity to assure you of every assistance and constant support which may lie in my power to aid you in the furtherance and successful accomplishment of your great task.   General Foch took command at a very critical time. The Germans had prepared the most formidable drive in the history of the war. They had gathered immense masses of munitions and supplies. Their great armies had been refitted and they were in hopes of a victory which would end the war. Their great offensive had many phases. It resulted in the development of three great salients, the first in Picardy and in the direction of Amiens along the Somme, which was launched on March 21st; the second on the Lys, which was launched on April 9th; and the third which is called the Oise-Marne salient, launched on May 27th.  Between the attacks which developed these salients there were also some unsuccessful attacks of almost equal power. On March 28th there was a desperate struggle to capture Arras, preceded by a bombardment as great as any during the whole offensive, but this attack was defeated with enormous losses to the German troops. A fourth phase of the German offensive took place on June 9th, on a front of twenty miles between Noyon and Montdidier, which gained a few miles at an enormous cost.   [Illustration: Map: Belgium and Eastern France, show the front from Ypres south to Rheims.]   THE LAST DESPERATE DRIVES OF THE GERMANS   On July 15th came the last of the great offensives. It was a smash on a sixty-mile line from Chateau-Thierry up the Marne, around Rheims, and then east to a few miles west of the Argonne forest. This offensive at the start made a penetration of from three to five miles, but was held firmly and much of the gain lost, through the counter-attacks of the Allies. It was at this point that the American troops first began to be seriously felt, and it was at this point that General Foch took up the story, and began the great series of Allied drives which were to crush the German power. But there had been many days of great anxiety before the turn of the tide.  The objects of the German drives were doubtless more or less dependent upon their success. The first drive in Picardy, in the direction of Amiens had apparently as its object to drive a wedge between the French and British and the object was so nearly attained that only the heroic work of General Carey saved the Allies from disaster.  The Fifth British army, which had borne the brunt of the German attack, had found itself almost crushed by the sheer weight of numbers. The whole line was broken up and it seemed as if the road was open to Amiens. French reinforcements could not come up in time; bridges could not be blown up because the engineers were all killed. Orders came to General Carey at two o\\'clock in the morning, March 26th, to hold the gap. He at once proceeded to gather an extemporized army.  Every available man was rounded up, among others a body of American engineers. Laborers, sappers, raw recruits as well as soldiers of every arm. There were plenty of machine guns, but few men knew how to handle them. With this scratch army in temporary trenches, he lay for six days, and as Lloyd George said, \"They held the German army and closed that gap on the way to Amiens.\"  During this fight General Carey rode along the lines shouting encouraging words to his hard-pressed men. He did not know whether he would get supplies of ammunition and provisions or not, but he stuck to it. Later on the regular troops arrived. The American engineers, who had been fighting, immediately returned to their base, and resumed work laying out trenches. General Rawlinson, Commander of the British army at that point, sent the commanding officer of the Americans engaged, the following letter:   The army Commander wishes to record officially his appreciation of the excellent work your regiment has done in assisting the British army to resist the enemy\\'s powerful offensive during the last ten days. I fully realize that it has been largely due to your assistance that the enemy has been checked, and I rely on you to assist us still further during the few days that are still to come before I shall be able to relieve you in the line. I consider your work in the line to be greatly enhanced by the fact that for six weeks previous to your taking your place in the front line your men had been working at such high pressure erecting heavy bridges on the Somme. My best congratulations and warm thanks to all. RAWLINSON.   The demoralization of General Gough\\'s Fifth army, which had thus left an eight-mile gap on the left, and which had been saved at that point by General Carey, permitted also the opening of another gap between its right wing and the Sixth French army. Here General Fayolle did with organized troops what Carey had done with his volunteers further north. The reason for the success of both Carey and Fayolle appears to have been that the German armies had been so thoroughly battered that they were unable to take advantage of the situation. Their regiments had been mixed up, their officers had been separated from their men in the rush of the attack, and before they could recover the opportunity was lost.  The first days of April saw the end of the drive toward Amiens. The Germans claimed the capture of ninety thousand prisoners and one thousand three hundred guns. They had penetrated into the Allies\\' territory in some points a distance of thirty-five miles. Their new line extended southwest from Arras beyond Albert to the west of Moreuil, which is about nine miles south of Amiens, and then went on west of Pierrepont and Montdidier, curving out at Noyon to the region of the Oise.  The first part of April was a comparative calm, when suddenly there developed the second drive of the German offensive. This drive was not so extensive as the first one, and its object appeared to be to break through the British forces in Flanders and reach the Channel ports. It resulted in a salient embracing an area about three hundred and twenty square miles, and the Germans claimed the capture of twenty thousand prisoners and two hundred guns. It was at this point that General Haig issued his famous order in which he described the British armies as standing with their \"backs to the wall.\" It reads as follows:   Three weeks ago today the enemy began his terrific attacks against us on a fifty-mile front. Its objects are to separate us from the French, to take the Channel ports, and to destroy the British army. In spite of throwing already one hundred and six divisions into the battle and enduring the most reckless sacrifice of human life, he has yet made little progress toward his goals. We owe this to the determined fighting and self-sacrifice of our troops. Words fail me to express the admiration which I feel for the splendid resistance offered by all ranks of our army under the most trying circumstances. Many among us now are tired. To those I would say that victory will belong to the side which holds out the longest. The French army is moving rapidly and in great force to our support. There is no other course open to us but to fight it out. Every position must be held to the last man. There must be no retiring. With our backs to the wall and believing in the justice of our cause each one of us must fight to the end. The safety of our homes, and the freedom of mankind depend alike upon the conduct of each one of us at this critical moment.   The British commander\\'s order made the situation clear to the British people and to the world. The Germans had given up for the moment their attempt to divide the British and French armies, and were now attempting to seize the Channel ports, and the British were fighting with true British pluck with their \"backs to the wall.\"  One can imagine the anxiety in the villages of Flanders where they watched the German advance and heard the terrible bombardment which was destroying their beautiful little cities, and threatening to put them under the dominion of the brutal conquerors of Belgium. Town after town fell to the enemy until at last the German attack began to weaken.  Counter-attacks on April 17th recaptured the villages of Wytschaete and Meteren. At other points German attacks were repulsed, and the attack on the Lys had reached its limits. It had not only failed to reach the coast but it had not even reached so far as to force the evacuation of Ypres or to endanger Arras. On the contrary the Germans had paid for their advance by such terrible losses that the ground that they had gained meant almost nothing. They then made, on April 30th, a vigorous endeavor to broaden the Amiens salient in the region of Hangard and Noyon. This attack also failed.  On May 27th Ludendorf made his next move. This was in the south, and was preceded by the most elaborate preparations over a forty-mile front. At first it met with great success. German troops from a point northwest of Rheims to Montdidier were moving apparently with the purpose of breaking the French lines and clearing the way for a drive to Paris. Consternation reigned among Allied observers as the Germans carried, apparently with ease, first the formidable Chemin des Dames, which was believed invulnerable, and then the south bank of the Aisne, with its great fortifications at Soissons.  Criticism began to appear of General Foch, who was thought at first to have been taken by surprise. The Germans were using four hundred thousand of their best troops, and the greatest force of tanks, machine guns and poison-gas projectors which they had ever gathered. They captured over forty-five thousand prisoners and took four hundred guns. They penetrated thirty miles and gained six hundred and fifty square miles of territory, but they were held on the River Marne.  It is now apparent that General Foch knew exactly what he was about. He might easily, by sending in reinforcements, have put up the same desperate resistance to the German offensive which they were now meeting in other sectors. But he preferred to retreat and lead the enemy on to a position which would make them vulnerable to the great counter-attack he was preparing for them on their flank. The Germans reached the Marne, but they paid for it in the terrible losses which they incurred.  The German line now from Montdidier, the extreme point of the Amiens salient, to Chateau-Thierry, the point of the new Marne salient, was in the form of a bow, and on June 9th General Ludendorf attempted to straighten out the line. His new attack was made on a twenty-mile front between Montdidier and Noyon in the direction of Compiegne. This was another terrific drive and at first gained about seven miles. French counter-attacks, however, not only held him in a vise but regained a distance of about one mile. This battle was probably the most disastrous one fought by the Germans during their whole offensive. Nearly four hundred thousand men were completely used up, without gaining the slightest strategic success.  Then followed a period without battles of major importance, during which General Foch by periodic assaults on the Lys, the Somme, on the flanks of Montdidier and Soissons, on the Chateau-Thierry sector and southwest of Rheims, captured many important positions and kept the enemy in constant anxiety.  During the great German offensives the Germans had lost at least five hundred thousand men, while the casualties of the Allies were barely one hundred and fifty thousand. The Germans also were beginning to lose their morale. They were finding that however great might be their efforts, however terrible might be their losses, they were still being constantly held. Their troops were now apparently made of inferior material, and included boys, old men and even convicts.  The system of making attacks by means of shock troops was producing the inevitable result. The shock regiments were composed of selected men, picked here and there, from the regular troops. Their selection had naturally weakened the regiments from which they were taken. After three months of great offensives these shock troops were now in great part destroyed, and the German lines were being held mainly by the inferior troops which had been left. Moreover, in other parts of the world, the allies of Germany were being beaten. In Italy and Albania and Macedonia there was danger.  The Germans prepared for one more effort. On June 18th they had made a costly attempt to carry Rheims. On July 15th they made their last drive. Ludendorf took almost a month for preparation. He gathered together seventy divisions and great masses of munitions, and then drove in from Chateau-Thierry on a sixty-mile line up on the Marne, and then east to the Argonne forests. His line made a sort of semicircle around Rheims and then pushed south to the east and west of that fortress.  Once again he had temporary success. West of Rheims he penetrated a distance of five miles, and on the first day, had crossed the Marne at Dormans, but was held sharply by the Americans east of Chateau-Thierry. On the second day he made further gains, but with appalling losses. On the 17th he was still struggling on with minor successes but on July 18th the French and Americans launched the great counter-offensive from Chateau-Thierry along a twenty-five mile front, between the Marne and the Aisne. The Germans everywhere began their retreat and the war tide had turned.  The German attack east of Rheims had been a failure from the start. The Allied forces retired about two miles and then held firm. The country there is flat and sandy and gave little shelter to the attacking forces which lost terribly. In this sector, too, there were many American troops, who behaved with distinguished bravery.  By this time nearly seven hundred thousand men of the American army were on the battle line. They had been fighting here and there among the French and English but on June 22d General March made the announcement that five divisions of these troops had been transferred to the direct command of General Pershing as a nucleus for an American army.  In glancing back at the great German drives which have now been described, one is impressed by the terrific character of the fighting. This struggle undoubtedly was the greatest exertion of military power in the history of the world. Never before had such masses of munitions been used; never before had scientific knowledge been so drawn on in the service of war. Thousands of airplanes were patrolling the air, sometimes scouting, sometimes dropping bombs on hostile troops or on hostile stores, sometimes flying low, firing their machine guns into the faces of marching troops. Thousands upon thousands of great guns were sending enormous projectiles, which made great pits wherever they fell. Swarms of machine guns were pouring their bullets like water from a hose upon the charging soldiers.  One of the most noticeable artillery developments was the long-range gun which off and on during this period was bombarding Paris. This bombardment began on March 23d, when the nearest German line was more than sixty-two miles away. For a time the story was regarded as pure fiction, but it was soon established that the great nine-inch shells which were dropping into the city every twenty minutes came from the forests of St. Gobain, seven miles back of the French trenches near Laon, and about seventy-five miles from Paris. This was another of those futile bits of frightfulness in which the Germans reveled. Military advantage gained by such a gun was almost nothing, and the expense of every shot was out of all proportion to the damage inflicted. It only roused intense indignation and stirred the Allies to greater determination. The first day\\'s casualties in Paris were ten killed and fifteen wounded. By the next day one would not have been able to tell from the Paris streets that such a bombardment was going on at all. The subway and surface cars were running, the streets were thronged and traffic was going on as usual. About two dozen shells were thrown into Paris every day, mainly in the Montmartre district, in a radius of about a mile. This seemed to show that the gun was immovable.  On March 29th, however, a shell struck the church of St. Gervais during the Good Friday service, killing seventy-five persons and wounding ninety. Fifty-four of those killed were women. The church had been struck at the moment of the Elevation of the Host. This outrage aroused special indignation, and Pope Benedict sent a protest to Berlin.  An examination of exploded shells indicated that the new German gun was less than nine inches in caliber, and that the projectiles, which weighed about two hundred pounds, contained two charges, in two chambers connected by a fuse which often exploded more than a minute apart. It took three minutes for each shell to travel to Paris and it was estimated that such a shell rose to a height of twenty miles from the earth. Three of these guns were used. One of these guns exploded on March 29th, killing a German lieutenant and nine men. The Kaiser was present when the gun was first used. It was said by American scientists that seismographs in the United States felt the shock of each discharge. On April 9th French aviators discovered the location of the new guns, and French artillery began to drop enormous shells weighing half a ton each near the German monsters. A few days later a French shell fell on the barrel of one of these guns and put it out of commission. Great craters were made around the other, interfering with its use, and toward the end of the period it was only occasionally that the remaining gun was fired, and no great damage resulted.  Another feature of the great German drives was the tremendous destruction that accompanied them. Not only were churches, public buildings, and private houses throughout almost the whole district turned into ruins, but the very ground itself was plowed up into craters and shell holes, and the trees smashed into mere splinters. During the whole campaign poison gas of various kinds was used in immense quantities, and it was constantly necessary for the troops to wear gas masks. Sometimes after a town had been evacuated by the enemy it was so filled with gas that it was impossible for victorious troops to enter. One of the fiercest bombardments was that directed against the Portuguese during the fighting along the Lys. The enemy made a special attempt to crush the Portuguese contingent which behaved with the utmost gallantry.  It was the season of the year when the orchards were covered with blossoms and the fields with flowers, but the horrors of war destroyed the beauty of the spring. In these battles men fought until they were completely exhausted and one could see troops staggering as they walked and leaning on each other from pure exhaustion.  These were days when wonders were performed by the Medical Departments of the Allied armies, and the work of the Red Cross was almost as important as the work of the soldiers. Relief for the wounded had to be undertaken and carried on a mammoth scale. Many of the doctors, nurses, orderlies and ambulance men lost their lives while making efforts to rescue the wounded.  These were days when the German leaders were filled with the pride of victory. They were talking now about a hard German peace. On June 17th the German Kaiser celebrated the thirtieth anniversary of his accession to the throne. He talked no more of a war of self-defense, but declared the war to be the struggle of two world views wrestling with each other. \"Either German principles of right, freedom, honor and morality must be upheld, or Anglo-Saxon principles with their idolatry of Mammon must be victorious.\" He sent congratulations to Field Marshal von Hindenburg, to General Ludendorf and to the Crown Prince. Von Hindenburg assured the Kaiser of the unswerving loyalty until death of Germany\\'s sons at the front, and concluded \"May our old motto \\'Forward with God for King and Fatherland, for Kaiser and Empire\\' result in many years of peace being granted to your Majesty after our victorious return home.\"  But the terrific attacks which the German commanders directed upon the Americans at Chateau-Thierry and at other points upon the southern lines show well that they knew that there was another danger rising to confront them; that during their great drives a million and a half American soldiers had been learning the art of war, and that every moment of delay meant a new danger. By the end of this period the Americans had arrived.    CHAPTER XLII  CHATEAU-THIERRY, FIELD OF GLORY  Nowhere in American history may be found a more glorious record than that which crowned with laurel the American arms at Chateau-Thierry. Here the American Marines and divisions comprising both volunteers and selected soldiers, were thrown before the German tide of invasion like a huge khaki-colored breakwater. Germany knew that a test of its empire had come. To break the wall of American might it threw into the van of the attack the Prussian Guard backed by the most formidable troops of the German and Austrian empires. The object was to put the fear of the Hun into the hearts of the Yankees, to overwhelm them, to drive straight through them as the prow of a battleship shears through a heavy sea. If America could be defeated, Germany\\'s way to a speedy victory was at hand. If America held--well, that way lay disaster.  And the Americans held. Not only did they hold but they counter-attacked with such bloody consequences to the German army that Marshal Foch, seizing the psychological moment for his carefully prepared counter-offensive, gave the word for a general attack.  With Chateau-Thierry and the Marne as a hinge, the clamp of the Allies closed upon the defeated Germans. From Switzerland to the North Sea the drive went forward, operating as huge pincers cutting like chilled steel through the Hindenburg and the Kriemhild lines. It was the beginning of autocracy\\'s end, the end of Der Tag of which Germany had dreamed.  The matchless Marines and the other American troops suffered a loss that staggered America. It was a loss, however, that was well worth while. The heroic young Americans who held the might of Germany helpless and finally rolled them back defeated from the field of battle, and who paid for that victory with their lives, made certain the speedy end of the world\\'s bloodiest war.  The story of the American army\\'s effective operations in France from Cantigny to the reduction of the St. Mihiel salient, is one long record of victories. To the glory of American arms must be recorded the fact that at no time and at no place in the World War did the American forces retreat before the German hosts.  In the latter days of May, 1918, the Allied forces in France seemed near defeat. The Germans were steadily driving toward Paris. They had swept over the Chemin des Dames and the papers from day to day were chronicling wonderful successes. The Chemin des Dames had been regarded as impregnable, but the Germans passed it apparently without the slightest difficulty. They were advancing on a forty-mile front and on May 28th had reached the Aisne, with the French and British steadily falling back. The anxiety of the Allies throughout the world was indescribable. This was the great German \"Victory Drive\" and each day registered a new Allied defeat. Newspaper headlines were almost despairing.  On May 29th, however, in quiet type, under great headlines announcing a German gain of ten miles in which the Germans had taken twenty-five thousand prisoners and crossed two rivers, had captured Soissons, and were threatening Rheims, there appeared in American papers a quiet little despatch from General Pershing. It read as follows:  \"This morning in Picardy our troops attacked on a front of one and one-fourth miles, advanced our lines, and captured the village of Cantigny. We took two hundred prisoners, and inflicted on the enemy severe losses in killed and wounded. Our casualties were relatively small. Hostile counter-attacks broke down under our fire.\" This was the first American offensive.  The American troops had now been in Europe almost a year. At first but a small force, they had been greeted in Paris and in London with tremendous enthusiasm. Up to this point they had done little or nothing, but the small force which passed through Paris in the summer of 1917 had been growing steadily. By this time the American army numbered more than eight hundred thousand men. They had been getting ready; in camps far behind the lines they had been trained, not only by their own officers, but by some of the greatest experts in the French and the British armies. Thousands of officers and men who, but a few months before, had been busily engaged in civilian pursuits, had now learned something of the art of war. They had been supplied with a splendid equipment, with great guns and with all the modern requirements of an up-to-date army.

MIHIEL SALIENT   The first major exploit carried out independently by the American army   was the obliteration of the St. Mihiel salient, which had been in   German hands since 1914, a spectacular achievement, carried out in two   days with great brilliance and precision. The picture shows U. S.   troops following the Germans through Thiaucourt, one of the towns on   the salient.   For some months, here and there, on the French and British lines small detachments of American troops flanked on both sides by the Allied forces, had been learning the art of war. Here and there they had been under fire. At Cantigny itself they had resisted attack. On May 27th General Pershing had reported \"In Picardy, after violent artillery preparations, hostile infantry detachments succeeded in penetrating our advance positions in two points. Our troops counter-attacked, completely expelling the enemy and entering his lines.\" They had also been fighting that day in the Woevre sector where a raiding party had been repulsed. There had been other skirmishes, too, in which many Americans had won honors both from Great Britain and France. But the attack at Cantigny was the first distinct American advance.  The Americans penetrated the German positions to the depth of nearly a mile. Their artillery completely smothered the Germans, and its whirr could be heard for many miles in the rear. Twelve French tanks supported the American infantry. The artillery preparation lasted for one hour, and then the lines of Americans went over the top. A strong unit of flame throwers and engineers aided the Americans. The American barrage moved forward a hundred yards in two minutes and then a hundred yards in four minutes. The infantry followed with clock-like precision. Fierce hand-to-hand fighting occurred in Cantigny, which contained a large tunnel and a number of caves. The Americans hurled hand grenades like baseballs into these shelters.  The attack had been carefully planned and was rehearsed by the infantry with the tanks. In every detail it was under the direction of the Superior French Command, to whom much of the credit for its success was due. The news of the American success created general satisfaction among the French and English troops. The operation, of course, was not one of the very greatest importance. It was a sort of an experiment, but coming as it did, in the middle of the great German Drive, it was ominous. America had arrived.  On May 30th General Pershing announced the complete repulse of further enemy attacks from the new American positions near Cantigny. This time he says: \"there was considerable shelling with gas, but the results obtained were very small. The attempt was a complete failure. Our casualties were very light. We have consolidated our positions.\"  The London Evening News commenting on this fact says: \"Bravo the young Americans! Nothing in today\\'s battle narrative from the front is more exhilarating than the account of their fight at Cantigny. It was clean cut from beginning to end, like one of their countrymen\\'s short stories, and the short story of Cantigny is going to expand into a full-length novel which will write the doom of the Kaiser and Kaiserism. Cantigny will one day be repeated a thousand fold.\"  The Germans, in reporting this fight, avoided mention of the fact that the operation had been conducted by American troops. This seemed to indicate that they feared the moral effect of such an admission in Germany. Up to this time, with the exception of small brigades, the American army had been held as a reserve. After the Cantigny fight they were hurried to the front. The main point to which they were sent at first was Chateau-Thierry, north of the Marne, the nearest point to Paris reached by the enemy. There, at the very critical point of the great German Drive, they not only checked the enemy but, by a dashing attack, threw him back.  This may be said to be the turning point in the whole war. It not only stopped the German Drive at this point, but it gave new courage to the Allies and took the heart out of the Germans. The troops were rushed to the battle front at Thierry, arriving on Saturday, June 1st. They entered the battle enthusiastically, almost immediately after they had arrived. A despatch from Picardy says: \"On their way to the battle lines they were cheered by the crowds in the villages through which they passed; their victorious stand with their gallant French Allies, so soon after entering the line, has electrified all France.\"  General Pershing\\'s terse account of what happened reads as follows: \"In the fighting northwest of Chateau-Thierry our troops broke up an attempt of the enemy to advance to the south through Veuilly Woods, and by a counter-attack drove him back to the north of the woods.\"  The American troops had gone, into the action only an hour or so after their arrival on the banks of the River Marne. Scarcely had they alighted from their motor trucks when they were ordered into Chateau-Thierry with a battalion of French-Colonial troops. The enemy were launching a savage drive, and at first succeeded in driving the Americans out of the woods of Veuilly-la-Poterie. But the Americans at once counter-attacked, driving their opponents from their position, and regaining possession of the woods.  On the same day the Germans launched an attack of shock troops, attempting to gain a passage across the Marne at Jaulgonne. They obtained a footing on the southern bank but another American counter-attack forced them back across the river. The American soldiers were fighting with wonderful spirit, and the French papers were filled with praise of their work. As they came up to go into the line they were singing, and they charged, cheering.   [Illustration: Map: Paris is in Southwest corner. Amiens in the Northwest corner and Rheims is on the East side.]   WHERE THE \"YANKS\" FOUGHT THE SECOND BATTLE OF THE MARNE   On June 6th came a climax of the American fighting. It was the attack of the American Marines in the direction of Torcy. This gained more than two miles over a two and a half mile front. On the next day the advance continued over a front of nearly six miles, and during the night the Americans captured Bouresches and entered Torcy.  The fighting at Torcy was characteristically American; the Marines advanced yelling like Indians, using bayonet and rifle. From Torcy the Marines set forward and took strong ground on either side of Belleau Wood. They had reached all the objectives and pushed beyond them. The Germans were on the run, and surrendering right and left to the Americans. The attack by the Marines forestalled an attack by the enemy. German reports now noticed the Americans. Their report on June 9th referring to this attack, says: \"Americans who attempted to attack northwest of Chateau-Thierry were driven back beyond their positions of departure with heavy losses and prisoners were captured.\" The Americans had lost heavily, and the hospitals were filled with their wounded, but the thorough American organization was giving the wounded every care, and the Americans were still moving forward.  On June the 10th, another attack was made on the German lines in the Belleau Wood, which penetrated for about two-thirds of a mile, leaving the Germans in possession of only the northern fringe of the Wood. On June 11th the official statement of the French War Office declared: \"South of the Ourcq River the American troops this morning brilliantly captured Belleau Wood, and took three hundred prisoners.\"  Belleau Wood had been considered an almost impregnable position, but the valiant fighting of the American Marines had carried them past it. Fighting here was not merely a series of exciting engagements, but an important action, which may have turned, and very probably did turn, the whole tide of battle. The Americans put three German divisions out of business, and caused a change in the German plans, by preventing an extending movement to Meaux, which was the German objective.  From this time on the confidence shown in all reports from the Allies in France was strengthened. They had found that the Americans were all that they had hoped for, and they were sure now that they could hold on until the full American strength could be brought to bear. General Pershing himself was full of optimism and his fine example stimulated his troops. From this time on all dispatches show that the Americans were more and more getting in the game. Repeated German attacks against their forces, on the Belleau-Bouresches line were repulsed, in spite of the fact that crack German divisions, who had been picked especially to punish them, had been found on their front. It was later found that these divisions had been suddenly ordered to that point \"in order to prevent at all costs the Americans being able to achieve success.\" The German High Command was apparently anxious to prevent American success from stimulating the morale of the Allied army.  During the rest of the summer the Americans took an active part in Foch\\'s great offensive which ultimately crushed the German army. They were heard from at widely divergent points: in Alsace, about Chateau-Thierry, at Montdidier, and in the British lines.  Most of the fighting during June indicated a slow advance at Chateau-Thierry. On June 19th the Americans crossed the Marne, near that city. But Chateau-Thierry itself was not captured until the middle of July. On June 29th they participated in a raid near Montdidier and on July 2d captured Vaux. In the week of July 4th news came of American success in the Vosges. On July 18th they advanced close to Soissons. On August 3d the Americans captured Fismes, and then for nearly a month made little actual progress, though bitter fighting went on in the country around Fismes and near Soissons. On August 29th after a furious battle they captured the plain of Juvigny, north of Soissons.  In all these battles the Americans were doing their part at difficult points, during the great French drive which was clearing out the Marne salient.  On the 12th of September, the first American army, assisted by certain French units, and under the direct command of General Pershing, launched an attack against the St. Mihiel salient. This was the most important operation of the American troops in the Great War. It was a complete success. September 12th was the fourth anniversary of the establishment of the salient, which reached out from the German line in the direction of Verdun.  The attack was fighting on a grand scale, and that such an operation should be intrusted to the American army indicated an entirely new phase of America\\'s participation in the war. It was preceded by a barrage lasting four hours. The German troops, though probably suspecting that such an attack was coming, were nevertheless surprised. The American attack was on the southern leg of the salient along a distance of twelve miles. The French attacked on the western side from a front of eight miles. Each attack was eminently successful. On the southern front the Americans reached their first objectives at some points an hour ahead of schedule time. Thiaucourt was captured early in the drive; later the Americans gained possession of Nonsard, Pannes, and Bouillonville.   [Illustration: Map: Verdun in the Northwest corner, St. Mihiel in Southwest, Metz in the Northeast]   THE GREAT ST. MIHIEL SALIENT ESTABLISHED IN 1914 WAS OBLITERATED BY   THE AMERICANS IN SEPTEMBER, 1918  At first the resistance of the Germans, without being tame, was not actually stiff, and the doughboys were able to sweep toward the second line of any position without difficulty. There, however, the Germans began to defend themselves sharply, which delayed, but did not stop the American advance. The attack was made in two waves and carried the American forces a distance of about five miles.  The next day the attack continued, and General Pershing\\'s dispatch stated: \"In the St. Mihiel sector we have achieved further successes. The junction of our troops advancing from the south of the sector with those advancing from the west has given us possession of the whole salient to points twelve miles northeast of St. Mihiel, and has resulted in the capture of many prisoners. Forced back by our steady advance the enemy is retiring, and is destroying large quantities of material as he goes. The number of prisoners counted has risen to 13,300. Our line now includes Herbeville, Thillet, Hattonville, St. Benoit, Xammes, Jaulny, Thiaucourt and Vieville.\"  The salient was wiped out, and the St. Mihiel front reduced from forty to twenty miles. Secretary Newton D. Baker, accompanied by Generals Pershing and Petain, visited St. Mihiel a few hours after its capture. They walked through the streets of the city, and heard many stories of the long German occupation.  As the attack proceeded it became more and more evident that the German defense had lost heart. Thousands of them surrendered, declaring they did not care to fight any more. It was also noted that a surprisingly large number of officers were among those captured. The only serious resistance was to the attack south of Fresnes, which was obviously for the purpose of protecting the German retreat.  The first American regiment stationed in the St. Mihiel sector was the 370th Infantry, formerly the Eighth Illinois, a Negro regiment officered entirely by soldiers of that race. This regiment was one of the three that occupied a sector at Verdun when a penetration there by the Germans would have been disastrous to the Allied cause.  The St. Mihiel salient had no great military value to the Germans, and was probably held by them from a sentimental motive. It represented the desperate efforts made by the Crown Prince in his early drive against Verdun. Its destruction, however, was of great importance to the French. It was not only a removal of a menace to the French citizens of Verdun, but it released the French armies at that point for active offensive operation. It also liberated the railway line from Verdun to Nancy, which was of the utmost value to General Pershing and the French armies to his left. It also later developed that the French command regarded the reduction of the St. Mihiel salient as the corner stone of a great encircling movement aimed at the German fortress of Metz. The moral effect of its reduction was also notable as it was one more sign of the weakening of the Germans.   [Illustration: Map: Verdun in the Northwest corner, St. Mihiel in Southwest, Metz in the Northeast]   HOW THE ST. MIHIEL SALIENT LOOKED SHORTLY AFTER THE ASSAULT BEGAN   The map indicates the beginning of the great American drive, assisted   by the French, in 1918, which resulted in the wiping out of the huge   salient. The Americans attacked on the south, the French in the north;   dotted lines indicate the advance in the first five hours.   History usually concerns itself with the deeds of humanity in the mass and with the leaders of these masses. It is eminently fitting, however, that this history should record the impressions made upon the mind of an American soldier by a modern battle. The United States Government singled out of all the letters received from the front, that written by Major Robert L. Denig, of Philadelphia, to his wife. The letter is now part of the archives of the War Department, and occupies the highest place of literary honor in the records of the Marines. It describes the operation against the Germans on the Marne on July 18th, 1918. This was the counter-attack led by the Marines which broke the back of the German invasion. Major Denig wrote:   The day before we left for this big push we had a most interesting fight between a fleet of German planes and a French observation balloon, right over our heads. We saw five planes circle over our town, then put on, what we thought afterwards, a sham fight. One of them, after many fancy stunts, headed right for the balloon. They were all painted with our colors except one. This one went near the balloon. One kept right on. The other four shot the balloon up with incendiary bullets. The observers jumped into their parachutes just as the outfit went up in a mass of flame.  The next day we took our positions at various places to wait for camions that were to take us somewhere in France, when or for what purpose we did not know. Wass passed me at the head of his company--we made a date for a party on our next leave. He was looking fine and was as happy as could be. Then Hunt, Keyser and a heap of others went by. I have the battalion and Holcomb the regiment. Our turn to en-buss did not come until near midnight.  We at last got under way after a few big \"sea bags\" had hit nearby. Wilmer and I led in a touring car. We went at a good clip and nearly got ditched in a couple of new shell holes. Shells were falling fast by now, and as the tenth truck went under the bridge a big one landed near with a crash, and wounded the two drivers, killed two marines and wounded five more. We did not know it at the time, and did not notice anything wrong till we came to a crossroad when we found we had only eleven cars all told. We found the rest of the convoy after a hunt, but even then were not told of the loss, and did not find it out until the next day.  We were finally, after twelve hours\\' ride, dumped in a big field and after a few hours\\' rest started our march. It was hot as Hades and we had had nothing to eat since the day before. We at last entered a forest; troops seemed to converge on it from all points. We marched some six miles in the forest, a finer one I have never seen--deer would scamper ahead and we could have eaten one raw. At 10 that night without food, we lay down in a pouring rain to sleep. Troops of all kinds passed us in the night--a shadowy stream, over a half-million men. Some French officers told us that they had never seen such concentration since Verdun, if then.  The next day, the 18th of July, we marched ahead through a jam of troops, trucks, etc., and came at last to a ration dump where we fell to and ate our heads off for the first time in nearly two days. When we left there, the men had bread stuck on their bayonets. I lugged a ham. All were loaded down.  Here I passed one of Wass\\' lieutenants with his hand wounded. He was pleased as Punch and told us the drive was on, the first we knew of it. I then passed a few men of Hunt\\'s company, bringing prisoners to the rear. They had a colonel and his staff. They were well dressed, cleaned and polished, but mighty glum looking.  We finally stopped at the far end of the forest near a dressing station, where Holcomb again took command. This station had been a big fine stone farm but was now a complete ruin--wounded and dead lay all about. Joe Murray came by with his head all done up--his helmet had saved him. The lines had gone on ahead so we were quite safe. Had a fine aero battle right over us. The stunts that those planes did cannot be described by me.  Late in the afternoon we advanced again. Our route lay over an open field covered with dead.  We lay down on a hillside for the night near some captured German guns, and until dark I watched the cavalry--some four thousand, come up and take positions.  At 3.30 the next morning Sitz woke me up and said we were to attack. The regiment was soon under way and we picked our way under cover of a gas infested valley to a town where we got our final instructions and left our packs. I wished Sumner good luck and parted.  We formed up in a sunken road on two sides of a valley that was perpendicular to the enemy\\'s front; Hughes right, Holcomb left, Sibley support. We now began to get a few wounded; one man with ashen face came charging to the rear with shell shock. He shook all over, foamed at the mouth, could not speak. I put him under a tent, and he acted as if he had a fit.  I heard Overton call to one of his friends to send a certain pin to his mother if he should get hit.  At 8.30 we jumped off with a line of tanks in the lead. For two \"kilos\" the four lines of Marines were as straight as a die, and their advance over the open plain in the bright sunlight was a picture I shall never forget. The fire got hotter and hotter, men fell, bullets sung, shells whizzed-banged and the dust of battle got thick. Overton was hit by a big piece of shell and fell. Afterwards I heard he was hit in the heart, so his death was without pain. He was buried that night and the pin found.  A man near me was cut in two. Others when hit would stand, it seemed, an hour, then fall in a heap. I yelled to Wilmer that each gun in the barrage worked from right to left, then a rabbit ran ahead and I watched him wondering if he would get hit. Good rabbit--it took my mind off the carnage. Looked for Hughes way over to the right; told Wilmer that I had a hundred dollars and be sure to get it. You think all kinds of things.  About sixty Germans jumped out of a trench and tried to surrender, but their machine guns opened up, we fired back, they ran and our left company after them. That made a gap that had to be filled, so Sibley advanced one of his to do the job, then a shell lit in a machine-gun crew of ours and cleaned it out completely.  At 10.30 we dug in--the attack just died out. I found a hole or old trench and when I was flat on my back I got some protection. Holcomb was next to me; Wilmer some way off. We then tried to get reports. Two companies we never could get in touch with. Lloyd came in and reported he was holding some trenches near a mill with six men. Cates, with his trousers blown off, said he had sixteen men of various companies; another officer on the right reported he had and could see forty men, all told. That, with the headquarters, was all we could find out about the battalion of nearly 800. Of the twenty company officers who went in, three came out, and one, Cates, was slightly wounded.  From then on to about 8 P. M. life was a chance and mighty uncomfortable. It was hot as a furnace, no water, and they had our range to a \"T.\" Three men lying in a shallow trench near me were blown to bits.  I went to the left of the line and found eight wounded men in a shell hole. I went back to Cates\\' hole and three shells landed near them. We thought they were killed, but they were not hit. You could hear men calling for help in the wheat fields. Their cries would get weaker and weaker and die out. The German planes were thick in the air; they were in groups of from three to twenty. They would look us over and then we would get a pounding. One of our planes got shot down; he fell about a thousand feet, like an arrow, and hit in the field back of us. The tank exploded and nothing was left.  We had a machine gun officer with us and at six a runner came up and reported that Sumner was killed. He commanded the machine-gun company with us. He was hit early in the fight by a bullet, I hear; I can get no details. At the start he remarked: \"This looks easy--they do not seem to have much art.\" Hughes\\' headquarters were all shot up. Turner lost a leg.  Well, we just lay there all through the hot afternoon.  It was great--a shell would land near by and you would bounce in your hole.  As twilight came, we sent out water parties for the relief of the wounded. Then we wondered if we would get relieved. At 9 o\\'clock we got a message congratulating us and saying the Algerians would take over at midnight. We then began to collect our wounded. Some had been evacuated during the day, but at that, we soon had about twenty on the field near us. A man who had been blinded wanted me to hold his hand. Another, wounded in the back, wanted his head patted, and so it went; one man got up on his hands and knees. I asked him what he wanted. He said, \"Look at the full moon,\" then fell dead. I had him buried, and all the rest I could find. All the time bullets sung and we prayed that shelling would not start until we had our wounded on top.  The Algerians came up at midnight and we pushed out. They went over at daybreak and got all shot up. We made the relief under German flares and the light from a burning town.  We went out as we came, through the gulley and town, the latter by now all in ruins. The place was full of gas, so we had to wear our masks. We pushed on to the forest and fell down in our tracks and slept all day. That afternoon a German plane got a balloon and the observer jumped and landed in a high tree. It was some job getting him down. The wind came up and we had to dodge falling trees and branches. As it was, we lost-- two killed and one wounded from that cause.  That night the Germans shelled us and got three killed and seventeen wounded. We moved a bit further back to the crossroad and after burying a few Germans, some of whom showed signs of having been wounded before, we settled down to a short stay.  It looked like rain, and so Wilmer and I went to an old dressing station to salvage some cover. We collected a lot of bloody shelter halves and ponchos that had been tied to poles to make stretchers, and were about to go, when we stopped to look at a new grave. A rude cross made of two slats from a box had written on it:  \"Lester S. Wass, Captain U. S. Marines, July 18, 1918\"  The old crowd at St. Nazaire and Bordeaux, Wass and Sumner killed, Baston and Hunt wounded, the latter on the 18th, a clean wound, I hear, through the left shoulder. We then moved further to the rear and camped for the night. Dunlap came to look us over. His car was driven by a sailor who got out to talk to a few of the marines, when one of the latter yelled out, \"Hey, fellows! Anyone want to see a real live gob, right this way.\" The gob held a regular reception. A carrier pigeon perched on a tree with a message. We decided to shoot him. It was then quite dark, so the shot missed. I then heard the following as I tried to sleep: \"Hell; he only turned around;\" \"Send up a flare;\" \"Call for a barrage,\" etc. The next day further to the rear still, a Ford was towed by with its front wheels on a truck.  We are now back in a town for some rest and to lick our wounds.  As I rode down the battalion, where once companies 250 strong used to march, now you see fifty men, with a kid second lieutenant in command; one company commander is not yet twenty-one.  After the last attack I cashed in the gold you gave me and sent it home along with my back pay. I have no idea of being \"bumped off\" with money on my person, as if you fall into the enemy\\'s hands you are first robbed then buried perhaps, but the first is sure.  Baston, the lieutenant that went to Quantico with father and myself, and of whom father took some pictures, was wounded in both legs in the Bois de Belleau. He nearly lost his legs, I am told, but is coming out O. K. Hunt was wounded in the last attack, got his wounds fixed up and went back again till he had to be sent out. Coffenburg was hit in the hand,--all near him were killed. Talbot was hit twice, but is about again. That accounts for all the officers in the company that I brought over. In the first fight 103 of the men in that outfit were killed or wounded. The second fight must have about cleaned out the old crowd.  The tanks, as they crushed their way through the wet, gray forest looked to me like beasts of the pre-stone age.  In the afternoon as I lay on my back in a hole that I dug deeper, the dark gray German planes with their sinister black crosses, looked like Death hovering above. They were for many. Sumner, for one. He was always saying, \"Denig, let\\'s go ashore!\" Then here was Wass, whom I usually took dinner with--dead, too. Sumner, Wass, Baston and Hunt--the old crowd that stuck together; two dead, one may never be any good any more; Hunt, I hope, will be as good as ever.

CHAPTER XLIII  ENGLAND AND FRANCE STRIKE IN THE NORTH  Up to July 18, 1918, the Allied armies in France had been steadily on the defensive, but on that date the tide turned. General Foch, who had been yielding territory for several months in the great German drives, now assumed the offensive himself and began the series of great drives which was to crush the German power and drive the enemy in defeat headlong from France.  The first of these great blows was the one which began with the appearance of the Americans at Chateau-Thierry. The Germans had formed a huge salient whose eastern extremity lay near Rheims, and its western extremity west of Soissons. It was like a great pocket reaching down in the direction of Paris from those two points. Against this salient the French and Americans had directed a tremendous thrust. The Germans resisted with desperation. It was the turning point of the war, but they were compelled to yield. Town after town was regained by the French and American troops, until, by August 5th, the Crown Prince had been driven from the Marne to the Vesle, and the salient obliterated.  On August 7th General Foch delivered his second blow. During the fighting on the Marne it had often been wondered by those who were observing the great French general\\'s strategy, why the British seemed to make no move. Occasionally there had been reports of minor assaults, either on the Lys salient, far north, or on the Somme and Montdidier sectors, lying between. It had not been noticed that in these minor assaults the English had been obtaining positions of strategic importance, and that they were steadily getting ready for an English offensive.  But their time had now come, and on August 7th the armies of Sir Douglas Haig began an attack against the armies of Prince Rupprecht on the Lys salient. This was followed, on August 8th, by another still greater Allied advance in Picardy, between Albert and Montdidier.  Both of these attacks met with notable success. On the Lys salient the English penetrated a distance of one thousand yards over a four-mile front, and followed up this advance by persistent attacks which led to the reoccupation, on August 19th, of Merville, and on August 31st, of Mont Kemmel. On this front the Germans had weakened their strength by withdrawing troops to aid other parts of their front, and the British were constantly taking advantage of this weakening.  The Germans had found this salient a failure. It had failed to attain its objective, the flanking of the Lens line south. They therefore were steadily retreating without any intention other than to extricate themselves from positions of no value, in the most economical manner. The quick operations of the British, however, led to the capture of many prisoners and guns.  The English offensive in Picardy was a more serious matter, and from some points of view was the greatest offensive in the war. The Allied front had been prepared for offensive operations by minor attacks which had secured for the Allied troops dominating positions. The attack was a surprise attack. The Germans were expecting local attacks but not a movement of this magnitude. The surprise was increased because it was made through a heavy mist which prevented observation. It was preceded by tremendous artillery fire which lasted for four minutes, and which was followed by the charge of infantry and tanks. The German artillery hardly replied at all, and only the resistance of a few rifles and machine guns fired vaguely through the fog met the charging troops.  The attack was on a twenty-five-mile front and on the first day gained seven miles, captured seven thousand men and a hundred guns. On the following day there was an advance of about five miles and seventeen thousand more prisoners were captured.  The Germans were now retiring in great haste, blowing up ammunition dumps and abandoning an enormous quantity of stores of all kinds. The English were using cavalry and airplanes, which were flying low over the field and throwing the German troops into confusion. Over three hundred guns, including many of heavy caliber, were captured. The ground had been plowed up by shells and thousands of bodies of men and horses were found lying where they fell. A feature of the attack was the swift whippet tanks which advanced far ahead of the infantry lines.

CANADIANS IN THE GREAT CAMBRAI DRIVE   One of the busy scenes just preceding the victorious attack by the   Canadians upon Cambrai. In the center can be seen captured Germans   carrying in one of their wounded comrades.   In the French official report occurred the following statement:  \"The brilliant operation which we, in concert with British troops, executed yesterday has been a surprise for the enemy. As occurred in the offensive of July 18th the soldiers of General Debeney have captured enemy soldiers engaged in the peaceful pursuit of harvesting the fields behind the German lines.\"  By August 10th the Germans had fallen back to a line running through Chaulnes and Roye. Montdidier had been captured, and eleven German divisions had been smashed. By August 12th the number of prisoners was 40,000, and by the 18th the Allied front was almost in the same line as it was in the summer of 1916, before the battle of the Somme.  The next step was to capture Bapaume and Peronne. The French, on August 19th, captured the Lassigny Massif, and continued to press on their attack. Noyon fell on the 29th, Roye on the 27th, Chaulnes on the 29th. Further north the British had captured Albert, and on the 29th occupied Bapaume. On September 1st they took Peronne with two thousand prisoners.  The advance still continued, and the German weakness was becoming more and more apparent. On September 6th the whole Allied line swept forward, with an average penetration of eight miles. Chauny was captured and the fortress of Ham. On September 17th the British were close to St. Quentin and the French in their own old intrenchments before La Fere. On September 18th a surprise advance over a twenty-two-mile front crossed the Hindenburg line at two points north of St. Quentin, Villeret and from Pontru to Hollom.  The first and third British armies, a little further to the north, were moving toward Cambrai and Douai, threatening not only them, but to get in the rear of Lens. This force proceeded up the Albert-Bapaume highway, and on August 27th captured a considerable portion of the Hindenburg line. On the 30th they reached Bullecourt and on September 2d crossed the Drocourt-Queant line on a six-mile-front. This was the famous switch line, meant to supplement the Hindenburg line and its capture meant the complete overthrow of the German intrenched positions at this point.   [Illustration: MAP: Arras in the Southwest corner, Douai in the Northeast.]   THE FAMOUS HINDENBURG LINE THAT CRUMBLED IN 1918.   The Germans retreated hastily to the Canal du Nord, and on September 3d Queant was captured by an advance on a twenty mile front, along with ten thousand prisoners. The Allied forces were moving steadily forward. On September 18th the British reached the defenses of Cambrai and were encircling the city of St. Quentin. On October 3d the advance upon Cambrai forced the Germans to evacuate the Lens coal fields, and on October 9th another advance over a thirty-mile front enabled the Allies to occupy Cambrai and St. Quentin. On the 11th they had reached the suburbs of Douai. By this time the whole of the Picardy salient had been wiped out.  The preceding summary of this great movement gives little idea of the tremendous struggle which had gone on during these two critical months, and hardly does more than suggest the tremendous importance of the British operations. The Hindenburg line was like a great fortification, and for more than a year had been regarded as impregnable. At Bullecourt there were two main lines. One hundred and twenty-five yards in front of the first line was a belt of wire twenty-five feet broad, so thick that it could not be seen through. The line itself contained double machine-gun emplacements of ferro-concrete, one hundred and twenty-five yards apart, with lesser emplacements between them. More belts of wire protected the support line. Here a continuous tunnel had been constructed at a depth of over forty feet. Every thirty-five yards there were exits with flights of forty-five steps. The tunnels were roofed and lined and bottomed with heavy timber, and numerous rooms branched off. They were lighted by electricity. Large nine-inch trench mortars stood at the traverses and strong machine-gun positions covered the line from behind.  The Hindenburg line was really only one of a series of twenty lines, each connected with the others by communicating trenches. The main lines were solid concrete, separated by an unending vista of wire entanglements. At points this barrier barbed wire extended in solid formation for ten miles. This tremendous system of defenses was originally called by the Germans the Siegfried line, and in the spring of 1917 they found it wise, at points where a strong offensive was expected, to fall back to it for protection. It had been their hope that it would prove an impassable barrier to the Allied troops, but now it had been broken, and the moral effect of the British success was even greater than the material.  One of the most noticeable results of the British advance had been the capture of Lens. It had been captured without a fight, because of the British threat upon its rear, but its capture was of tremendous importance. Lens had been the scene of bitter fighting in the latter part of August, 1917, when the Canadians had specially distinguished themselves. This city had been heavily fortified by the Germans who had recognized its importance as being the center of the great Lens coal fields, and they had never given it up. It had sometimes been described as the strongest single position that had ever confronted the Allies on the western front. It had been made a sort of citadel of reinforced concrete. Even the courage and power of the Canadians had only given them possession of some of its suburbs. Between these suburbs and the concrete citadel were the coal pits, with their fathomless depths of ages and the mysteries of kultural strategy. The struggle became a succession of avalanches of gas, burning oil, rifle and machine-gun fire. Both sides lost terrifically, but the Germans had held the town. Now it was given up without a blow and its great coal fields were once more in possession of the French. Before retreating the Germans showed their usual destructive energy and the mines were found flooded as a result of consistent and scientific use of dynamite.  The recapture of Lens was cheering news in Paris. Not the least of the many sufferings of the French during the last two years of the war was that which came from the scarcity of coal. Indeed, more than once during those two winters coal could not be obtained at any price. These periods unfortunately came in the latter part of the winter, and it happened they were unusual periods of intense cold. Thousands of people stayed in bed all day in order to keep warm. The capture of Lens, therefore, had been anxiously desired. Nearly the whole of the French coal supply had come from Lens and the adjacent Bethune coal fields. The Bethune field, although steadily working, had never produced enough coal for even the pressing necessities of the French munition works.  The news that Bapaume had fallen on August 29th brought back, especially to the British, memories not only of the previous year and of the great forward movement which, on March 17th, had swept them over Bapaume and Peronne, but also bitter memories of the retreat in the previous March, which had carried them back under the overwhelming German pressure. The capture therefore was balm to their spirits, and an English correspondent, Mr. Philip Gibbs, who had accompanied the British on their previous advance, found officers and men full of laughter and full of memories.  On all sides were the battle-fields of 1916 and 1917; Mametz Wood, Belleville Wood, Usna Hill, Ginchy, Morval, Guillemont. The fields were covered with battle debris, and yet to the English it was sacred ground from the graves of the men who fell there. Those graves still remained. The British shell fire had not touched them, but as the English advanced there were many bodies of gray-clad men on the roads and fields, and dead horses, and a litter of barbed wire, and deep shelters dug under banks, and shell craters, and helmets, gas masks, and rifles thrown here and there by the enemy as they fled. Now it was the Germans that were fleeing, and fleeing hopelessly, sullen, bitter at their officers, impatient of discipline.  One of the great differences between the attacks of the Allies in their last year of the war and those of preceding years, was the increased use and the improved character of the tanks. The tanks were a development of the war. Before the war, however, the development of the caterpillar tractor had suggested to a few farsighted people the possibility of evolving from this invention a machine capable of offensive use over rough country in close warfare. Experiments were made in behalf of the English War Office for some time without practical results.  At last, after these experiments had resulted in various failures, a type of tractor was finally designed which produced satisfactory results. It was a caterpillar tractor, with an endless self-laid track, over which internal driving wheels could be propelled by the engines. It was not until July, 1916, that the first consignment of these new engines of warfare arrived at the secret maneuver ground.  There were two kinds. One called the male was armed with two Hotchkiss quick-fire guns, as well as with an armament of machine guns. The other type, called the female, was armed only with machine guns. The male tank was designed for dealing with the concrete emplacements for the German machine guns. The other was more suitable for dealing with machine-gun personnel and riflemen. Some time was taken in training men to use these tanks, for the crew of a tank must suffer a great deal of hardship on account of the noise of the engine every command had to be made by signs, and the motion of the tank being like that of a ship on a heavy sea, was likely to produce seasickness.  The tanks were painted with weird colors for the purpose of concealment, and when they first appeared caused a great deal of wonder and amusement. They were first used in battle on September 15, 1916, in a continuation of the battle of the Somme, and proved a great surprise to the Germans. The Germans directed all available rifle and machine-gun fire upon them without success. A correspondent narrates that: \"As the \\'Creme de Menthe\\' moved on its way, the bullets fell from its sides harmlessly. It advanced upon a broken wall, leaned up against it heavily, until it fell with a crash of bricks, and then rose on to the bricks and passed over them and walked straight into the midst of factory ruins.\" They were an immense success and had come to stay.    CHAPTER XLIV  BELGIUM\\'S GALLANT EFFORT  For more than four years Belgium suffered under the iron heel of the German invaders. One little corner in the far west was occupied by her gallant army, fighting with the utmost courage and a patriotism which has won the admiration of the world under its great King Albert, whose heroic leadership had turned the little commercial nation into a nation of heroes. Conditions of life in the Belgian cities were almost intolerable. The great Belgian Relief Commission, under the direction of Mr. Hoover, had kept the people from starvation, but it could not secure them their rights. They lived in the midst of brutality and injustice.  On Belgian Independence Day at London, Arthur J. Balfour, the British Foreign Minister, made an address in which he commented upon the German treatment of Belgium. In the course of his address he said: \"Bitter must be the thought in every Belgian heart of what Belgians in Belgium are now suffering. Let them however, take courage. Let their spirits rise in a mood of profound cheerfulness, for these dark days are not going to last forever, and when they come to a conclusion, when again peace dawns upon this much tormented and cruelly tried world, when Belgium is again free and prosperous, then Belgians, whether they have spent these unhappy years in exile, or, an even harder fate, have spent them in their own country, they will be able to look back upon this time of cruel and unexampled trial, and they will say to themselves, to their children and to their descendants, that Belgium, though her existence as a political entity is less than a century, has within that period shown an example of courage, constancy and virtue to mankind for which all the world should be grateful.\"  The English Foreign Minister was perhaps not prophesying. He knew something of what was coming. The Great Offensive which was to free Belgium of her German oppressor was already under way. The first move, however, was not upon land, but upon the sea. In the autumn of 1914 the little Belgian port of Zeebrugge, with the neighboring port of Ostend, was captured by the Germans. The Germans, who had already seized the shipbuilding plants at Antwerp, then began to build submarines, and sent them down the canals through Bruges to Zeebrugge and Ostend. From these ports they proceeded to attack the English commerce.  In the spring of 1918 submarine attacks on English shipping were so serious that England was using every possible effort to destroy these piratical craft, and it was determined to make an attempt to block the entrances to the canals at Zeebrugge and at Ostend, by sinking old ships in the channels.  The expedition took place during the night of April 22d, under the command of Vice-Admiral Sir Roger Keyes. Six obsolete British cruisers took part in the expedition. These were the Brilliant, Iphigenia, Sirius, Intrepid, Thetis and Vindictive. The Vindictive carried storming parties to destroy the stone mole at Zeebrugge; the remaining five cruisers were filled with concrete, and it was intended that they should be sunk in the entrances of the two ports. A large force of monitors and small fast craft accompanied the expedition. An observer thus describes the heroic exploit:  The night was overcast and there was a drifting haze. Down the coast a great searchlight swung its beam to and fro in the small wind and short sea. From the Vindictive\\'s bridge, as she headed in toward the mole, there was scarcely a glimmer of light to be seen shoreward. Ahead as she drove through the water rolled the smoke screen, her cloak of invisibility, wrapped about her by small craft. This was the device of Wing-Commander Brock, without which, acknowledged the Admiral in command, the operation could not have been conducted. A northeast wind moved the volume of it shoreward ahead of the ships. Beyond it was the distant town, its defenders unsuspicious.  It was not until the Vindictive, with bluejackets and marines standing ready for landing, was close upon the mole, that the wind lulled and came away again from the southeast, sweeping back the smoke screen and laying her bare to eyes that looked seaward, There was a moment immediately afterward when it seemed to those on the ships as if the dim harbor exploded into light. A star shell soared aloft, then a score of star shells. Wavering beams of the searchlights swung around and settled into a glare. A wild fire of gun flashes leaped against the sky; strings of luminous green beads shot aloft, hung and sank. The darkness of the night was supplemented by a nightmare daylight of battle-fired guns, and machine guns along the mole. The batteries ashore woke to life.  It was in a gale of shelling that the Vindictive laid her nose against the thirty-foot-high concrete side of the mole, let go her anchor, and signaled to the Daffodil to shove her stern in. The Iris went ahead and endeavored to get alongside likewise.  The fire was intense while the ships plunged and rolled beside the mole in the seas, the Vindictive, with her greater draft, jarring against the foundations of the mole with every lunge. They were swept diagonally by machine-gun fire from both ends of the mole and by the heavy batteries on shore. Captain Carpenter conned the Vindictive from the open bridge until her stern was laid in, when he took up his position in the flame thrower hut on the port side. It is marvelous that any occupant should have survived a minute in this hut, so riddled and shattered was it.  The officer of the Iris, which was in trouble ahead of the Vindictive, described Captain Carpenter as handling her like a picket boat. The Vindictive was fitted along her port side with a high, false deck, from which ran eighteen brows, or gangways, by which the storming and demolition parties were to land. The men gathered in readiness on the main lower decks, while Colonel Elliott, who was to lead the marines, waited on the false deck just abaft the bridge. Captain Hallahan, who commanded the bluejackets, was amidships. The word for the assault had not yet been given when both leaders were killed.  The mere landing on the mole was a perilous business. It involved a passage across the crashing and splintering gangways, a drop over the parapet into the field of fire of the German machine-guns which swept its length, and a further drop of some sixteen feet to the surface of the mole itself. Many were killed and more wounded as they crowded up the gangways, but nothing hindered the orderly and speedy landing by every gangway. The lower deck was a shambles, as the commander made the round of the ship, yet the wounded and dying raised themselves to cheer as he made his tour.  The Iris had trouble of her own. Her first attempts to make fast to the mole ahead of the Vindictive failed, as her grapnels were not large enough to span the parapet. Two officers, Lieutenant-Commander Bradford, and Lieutenant Hawkins, climbed ashore and sat astride the parapet trying to make the grapnels fast, till each was killed, and fell down between the ship and the wall. Commander Valentine Gibbs had both legs shot away, and died next morning. Lieutenant Spencer though wounded, took command and refused to be relieved.   [Illustration: Layout of harbor; North sea at top, with lighthouse, quay and wireless station. Foreground shows harbor facilities and submarine pens.]   ZEEBRUGGE HARBOR, BLOCKED BY BRITISH   The Iris was obliged at last to change her position and fall in astern of the Vindictive, which suffered very heavily from fire. Her total casualties were eight officers and sixty-nine men killed, and three officers and 103 men wounded.  The storming parties upon the mole met with no resistance from the Germans other than an intense and unremitting fire. One after another buildings burst into flames, or split and crumbled as dynamite went off. A bombing party working up toward the mole in search of the enemy destroyed several machine gun emplacements but not a single prisoner awarded them. It appears that upon the approach of the ships and with the opening of fire the enemy simply retired and contented themselves with bringing machine guns to the short end of the mole.  The object of the fighting on the mole was in large part to divert the enemy\\'s attention while the work of blocking the canals was being accomplished.  Of this operation the official narrative says: \"The Thetis came first steaming into a tornado of shells from great batteries ashore. All her crew save a remnant who remained to steam her in and sink her, already had been taken off her by a ubiquitous motor launch. The remnant spared hands enough to keep her four guns going. It was hers to show the road to the Intrepid and Iphigenia which followed. She cleared a string of armed barges, which defends the channel from the tip of the mole, but had the ill-fortune to foul one of her propellers upon a net defense which flanks it on the shore side. The propeller gathered in the net and it rendered her practically unmanageable. Shore batteries found her and pounded her unremittingly. She bumped into the bank, edged off and found herself in the channel again, still some hundreds of yards from the mouth of the canal in practically a sinking condition. As she lay she signaled invaluable directions to others, and her commander blew charges and sank it. Motor launches took off her crew. The Intrepid, smoking like a volcano, and with all her guns blazing, followed. Her motor launch had failed to get alongside, outside the harbor, and she had men enough for anything. Straight into the canal she steered, her smoke blowing back from her into the Iphigenia\\'s eyes so that the latter was blinded, and going a little wild, ran into the dredger, with her barge moored beside it, which lay at the western arm of the canal. She was not clear though, and entered the canal, pushing the barge before her.  \"It was then that a shell hit the steam connections of her whistle and the escape of steam which followed drove off some of the smoke, and let her see what she was doing. Lieutenant Carter, commanding the Intrepid, placed the nose of his ship neatly on the mud of the western bank, ordered his crew away, and blew up his ship by switches in the chart room. Lieutenant Leake, commanding the Iphigenia, beached her according to arrangement on the eastern side, blew her up, saw her drop nicely across the canal, and left her with her engines still going to hold her in position till she should have bedded well down on the bottom. According to the latest reports from air observation the two old ships, with their holds full of concrete, are lying across the canal in a V-position, and it is probable that the work they set out to do has been accomplished and that the canal is effectively blocked.\"  At Ostend an attempt was also made to block the canal on the same night, but it was unsuccessful owing to a shift of wind which blew away the smoke screen behind which the British craft were acting, and enabled the German gun fire to destroy the flares which had been lit to mark the entrance to the harbor. The cruisers tried to act by guess work, and one of the block ships was sunk, but it was not in a position to obstruct the canal.  On May 9th another attempt was made, and the Vindictive, filled with concrete was sunk in the Ostend channel.   This daring exploit of the English fleet, though it had destroyed the value of Zeebrugge and Ostend as submarine bases, had left the Germans in possession. In September, however, General Foch determined that the time had come to throw his armies against the German forces in the distracted little country. He planned two widely separated thrusts. On the south he sent Pershing against the Germans between the Argonne and the Meuse. They made rapid progress, capturing Montfaucon, Varennes and driving on until they had destroyed the German control of the Paris-Chalons-Verdun Railroad.  This was a serious blow to the Germans, for a further push northward would cut the vital lateral railway connecting the German armies in Belgium and France with those in Alsace-Lorraine. Ludendorf hastened reserves to this front, and the American operation was slowed down. Meanwhile at the other end of the line the Belgians, with General Plumer\\'s Second British Army, suddenly attacked on a front which extended all the way from the canal at Dixmude to the Lys, swept the Germans out of all the famous fighting ground of the Ypres salient, pushed across the Passchendaele Ridge and down into the Flanders plain below.  The situation of the Germans in the Lille regions of the south and also along the Belgian coast became at once dangerous. Once more Ludendorf was compelled to send reserves, and this thrust began to slow up but it was not checked permanently, and the Belgian armies were to move on. While this advance was being conducted the British fleet were bombarding the coastal defenses. The Belgian army, fighting with the utmost spirit under command of King Albert, made a penetration of five miles and captured four thousand prisoners and an immense amount of supplies.  On September 30th they captured the city of Roulers. For ten days there was a consolidation of position by the Allies, but on October 14th they made a furious attack in the general direction of Ghent and Courtrai. Thousands of prisoners and several complete batteries of guns were captured. In this attack British, Belgian and French troops took part, and the troops of the three nations went over the top without preliminary bombardment, taking the enemy by surprise.  On October 15th the news from Flanders showed that the victory was growing in extent, the Allied armies were advancing on a front of about twenty-five miles, and in some places had penetrated the enemy\\'s positions six or seven miles. The Belgians had captured seven thousand prisoners and the British and French about four thousand. In French Flanders the British advanced to a point about three miles west of Lille.  The battle was carried on in a heavy rain which turned the battle-fields into seas of mud; while this hampered the Allied troops it hindered even more the Germans in trying to move away their material through the mired ground of the Flanders Lowland.  On the next day dispatches indicated that a retreat on a tremendous scale in northern Belgium was under way. The Germans were retreating so fast that the Allies lost touch with the enemy. The gallant little Belgian army, assisted by crack British and French troops, had driven the despoilers of its country from a large section which the Germans had occupied since the early days of the war, and had gained positions of such importance as to make it probable that the Germans would have to abandon the entire coast of Belgium.  Moreover, on the south, the city of Lille, with the great mining and manufacturing districts around it, was being left in a salient which was growing deeper every hour and which the enemy could not hope to hold. At certain points the resistance of the Germans was extraordinarily fierce. This was especially true in the region of Thouret. The battle here was from street to street and from house to house. The Germans had placed machine-guns in the windows of houses and cellars and fired murderous streams of bullets into the advancing Belgians but were unable to stop them.  The Belgians fought with a dogged determination such as only troops fighting to regain their outraged country could display. Nothing could stop them. At other points, especially in the northern part of the battle area, the Germans surrendered freely. Many civilians were rescued from the towns and districts captured, and little processions of these were straggling rearward out of range of the guns, and out of the way of the fighting troops. At times liberated Belgian women could see their sons, brothers or husbands going forward into battle. On October 17th the German retreat in Flanders became a rout. The enemy were fleeing rapidly on their entire front. The British entered Lille.  The Germans fled from Ostend and British naval forces were landed there. The Belgian infantry were sweeping up the coast, and Belgian patrols entered Bruges. In the afternoon of the day King Albert of Belgium, and Queen Elizabeth entered Ostend. The splendid fighting of the Belgian troops and their magnificent victory was now attracting universal attention. It was one of the revelations of the war. They were bearing the giant\\'s share of the work of the Allied armies in their own country, and had already liberated territory which more than doubled the area of that part of Belgium which had been in their possession.  With the Belgian coast cleared of invaders it became open to British transports which would afford relief to the whole Allied armies from the resultant decrease in the congestion of the channel ports. On October 19th the progress continued. Zeebrugge was occupied by the Allies, the last Belgian port remaining in German hands.  The Belgian advance continued along the whole line. King Albert entered Bruges. Day after day the advance continued. The reception of the King and Queen of Belgium in the recovered towns was something to remember. In Bruges they rode in amid the tumultuous cheering of the frenzied population. On the central square they were received by the burgomaster with an escort of a solitary gendarme, who had refused to give up his uniform and old-fashioned rifle to the enemy; though fined and imprisoned he had kept their hiding place secret. As he stood there alone with fixed bayonet the King and the Queen shook him by the hand and congratulated him. Greatly moved, he stammered, \"It is too great an honor, too great an honor.\"  And with all this happiness came the happiness arising from the return of the soldiers to the homes from which they had been absent so long, the reunions of husband and wife, of parents and children. Belgium was now to reap the reward for her heroism.    CHAPTER XLV  ITALY\\'S TERRIFIC DRIVE  For many months after the great Italian stand on the Piave there was inactivity on both fronts in Italy. The Italians had been reinforced by troops from France and Great Britain and their own army was now larger than it had been at any other time. On June 15th, about the time when the Germans were being driven back on the Marne and the Oise, the Austrians, urged to action by the Germans, suddenly undertook a great offensive on a front from the Asiago Plateau to the sea, a distance of ninety-seven miles.  From the very start it was plain that the Italians were resisting magnificently. The offensive was not unexpected, either in time or locality, and had been openly discussed in the Italian press. The Italians therefore were not taken by surprise, and moreover since the disaster of Caparetto the Italians had learned by a patient campaign of education what they were fighting for.  On the second day of the battle the Austrian troops made a desperate effort to break through the Italian lines, particularly in the eastern sector of the Asiago Plateau, and crossed the Piave River at two places. They also attacked the French positions between Osteria di Monfenera and Maranzine, but were driven back with heavy loss. At every point where the Austrians were able to advance the Italians initiated vigorous counter-attacks. The order to Italy\\'s army was, \"Hold at any cost.\"  On the third day of the battle the Austrian offensive was being strongly checked. They had established three bridgeheads on the Piave, but had not been able to advance. The most notable of these crossings was that in the Montello sector. Montello is of particular importance, because it is the hinge between the mountains and the Piave sectors of the Italian front. If it could be held the Austrians would be in a position to dominate from the flank and rear all the Italian positions defending the line of the Piave in the dead flat plain to the south.   [Illustration: Painting]   STORMING THE MOLE AT ZEEBRUGGE   One of the most brilliant and spectacular feats in naval history was   the British blocking of the submarine harbor at Zeebrugge. The picture   shows one of the detachments of marines that braved the terrific   German defense fire and swarmed up the mole that protects the harbor,   planting explosives that made a great breach and let the tides in.   [Illustration: Photograph]   ITALIAN TROOPS TREKKING THE SNOW-FIELDS OF THE ALPS   The Alpine troops of the Italian army have for years developed a   military technique peculiar to the regions they must cover. Here a   battalion of Alpini is seen on skis, the best method for traveling   over the frozen snow crusts of the mountain region.   On the Lower Piave the Austrians had made gains and had captured Capo Sile. The Austrians were using a million men and were using liquid fire and gas bombs, but their every move was resisted strongly. Vienna was claiming the capture of 30,000 men, but the Italian reports claimed that the Austrian losses were stupendous. Thousands of dead were heaped before the Italian line in the mountain sectors, blocking the mule paths and choking the defiles. No fewer than nine desperate onslaughts upon Monte Grappa, always with fresh reserves, were broken upon Grappa heights, with terrific losses.  On July 19th the dispatches from Rome were emphasizing the Italian counter-attacks. Not only were the Italians preventing the enemy from making further gains, but they were beginning to crowd him back at the points where he had crossed the river, and were raining bombs and machine-gun bullets upon the Austrian troops at the bridgehead. They were also taking the initiative in the fighting in the mountain sectors.  By June 20th the Austrian defeat was clear. Their forces were backed against the flooded Piave, which had carried away their bridges and left them to the mercy of the Italians. Thousands were being killed and other thousands captured. Czecho-Slovak troops, it was reported, had joined in the fighting, and had given their first tribute of blood to the generous principles of freedom and independence for which they were in arms. In the Piave delta the Italians had regained Capo Sile, which had been captured early in the drive, and it was reported that all along the Piave line they had won complete control of the air, not a single Austrian machine being still aloft. The spirits of the Austrian troops had been definitely weakened. They were war wearied, and evidence began to accumulate that Austria\\'s drive was a \"hunger offensive.\"  As the battle continued reports began to arrive of the gallant deeds of American airmen, who were helping in the fighting along the front. The airmen were assisting in destroying the bridges that the Austrians were trying to throw across the river. The Piave was now a vast cataract and the bridges which it had not washed down were constantly destroyed by the aviators. The Austrians on the western bank were finding it difficult to obtain supplies and were resorting to hydroplanes for that purpose. On June 24th the Austrian attack had definitely failed and they were fleeing in disorder across the Piave. One hundred and eighty thousand men had already been lost and forty thousand were hemmed in on the western side of the river. The Austrian communications were emphasizing the difficulties they were meeting with through the heavy rains.  The victory of the Italians, which was now apparent, was received all over Italy with great public rejoicing. Italy had been repenting in sackcloth and ashes her defeat of the previous fall. Now they had made amends and were showing what the Italian soldier could really do. In America, and among the Allied Powers, there was great enthusiasm, and Secretary of War Baker sent this congratulatory message to the Italian Minister of War:   Your Excellency: The people of the United States are watching with enthusiasm and admiration the splendid exploits of the great army of Italy in resisting and driving back the enemy forces which recently undertook a major offensive on the Italian front. I take great pleasure in tendering my own hearty congratulations, and would be most happy to have a message of greeting and congratulation transmitted to General Diaz and his brave soldiers. NEWTON D. BAKER, Secretary of War of the United States.   In announcing to his victorious army the repulse of the Austrians General Diaz, the Italian Commander-in-Chief, said:   \"The enemy who, with furious impetuosity, used all means to penetrate our territory has been repulsed at all points. His losses are very heavy. His pride is broken. Glory to all commands, all soldiers, all sailors.\"   On the 26th of June the Italian troops, having forced the last rear guard of the retreating Austrians to surrender and completely occupied the west bank of the Piave, began an offensive on the mountain front in the Monte Grappa sector. They gained more than 3,000 prisoners, and considerable territory. On the southern part of the Piave front they were carrying on a vigorous offensive against the Austrian positions within the Piave delta. The Austrian troops, at that point, were being prevented from retreat by the high water, and suffered terrible losses. On July 6th the Italians drove the last of the enemy from the delta.  The campaign in Italy now languished, until, on October 27th, Italy began her last terrible drive. The great Italian offensive was made not only by their own forces and the French and British troops, which had assisted them the previous June, but during the intervening period a large force of Americans had arrived in Italy. On June 27th Secretary Baker had made the announcement that General Pershing had been instructed to send into Italy a regiment that was then in training in France. The regiment thus sent was augmented considerably later. The purpose of sending troops to Italy, Mr. Baker explained, was rather political than military. It was desired to demonstrate again that the Allied nations and the United States were one in their purposes on all fronts, and to extend the intercourse between the troops of all the powers at war with Germany.  On the second day of the Italian offensive their success increased. More than nine thousand Austrians were taken prisoners and fifty-one guns were captured. The Piave River had been crossed, and the Italians had advanced four miles to its east. The attacks in the mountain region were being more bitterly contested, and counter-attacks had enabled the enemy to regain some of their lost positions.  On October 30th the Italian advance was continuing. The Austrian front appeared to be breaking under the heavy blows of the Allied troops. Dispatches indicated striking successes, not only on the Italian front but at the points where the British and the French were holding the line. The Americans were being held in reserve, but American airplanes were actively participating in the work at the front. By this time the last lines of the Austro-Hungarian resistance on the central positions along the Piave River had been broken, and more than fifteen thousand prisoners been taken. The Austrians, however, had been desperately resisting, and their artillery fire at many points was very effective, especially that which had been directed at the pontoon bridges thrown across the Piave.  King Victor Emanuel had been present in person during the crossing, and was often under the fire of the Austrian guns. On October 30th, 33,000 Austrians had been captured and the Italians had reached Vittorio. Americans had now joined in the fighting.  The Austrian retreat reached the proportion of a rout. They were still fighting, especially in the mountain region, but in the plains east of the Piave they were in full flight. Taking into consideration the numbers of troops in the Austrian lines and their apparently plentiful supplies, it began to seem probable that their break was due more to political maneuvers than to military force. The Austrians at this time were making a great peace drive, and the dissatisfaction at home had affected the morale of the troops at the front. The conditions in Italy were in close resemblance to those in Bulgaria just before Bulgaria applied for an armistice.  On the 1st of November the Austrians were completely routed, and were streaming in confusion down the valleys of the Alpine foothills, and fleeing northward from the Piave. Reports from Austria indicated riots at Vienna and Budapest. In Vienna people were parading the streets, shouting \"Down with the Hapsburgs!\" On October 29th, the Austrians asked for an armistice. Their announcement read as follows:   The High Command of the armies, early Tuesday, by means of a Parliamentaire, established communication with the Italian army command. Every effort is to be made for the avoidance of further useless sacrifice of blood, for the cessation of hostilities, and the conclusion of an armistice. Toward this step which is animated by the best intentions the Italian High Command at first assumed an attitude of unmistakable refusal, and it was only on the evening of Wednesday that, in accord with the Italian High Command, General Weber, accompanied by a deputation, was permitted to cross the fighting line for preliminary pourparlers.   General Diaz, the Italian Commander, had referred the Austrian request to the Versailles Conference, and had acted in accordance with their direction. In proposing the armistice the Austrians had also expressed their resolve to bring about peace and to evacuate the occupied territory of Italy. This was the beginning of the end.  The northern part of Italy is bounded by the Alps, and between those lofty ranges and the deep valleys there had been constant fighting. In this fighting, both on mountain and in valley, there were the most extraordinary deeds of individual heroism, constantly exhibited.  The Alpine regiments, known in Italy as the Alpini, were men of extraordinary physical powers, accustomed to mountain climbing, and filled with courage and patriotism. Owing to the nature of the territory in such contests, only a limited number of men could be used at one time, and the fighting went on over masses of snow or solid rock. Guns were hauled up precipices and dugouts excavated in the rock itself. The Italian troops, clothed in white overalls to prevent their being seen, moved with great rapidity from point to point, and forced their enemy to keep constantly on the alert. In the great Italian drive just described the most bitter fighting was that which occurred in these mountainous regions.  The work of the Italian aviators is also worthy of special attention. They not only secured entire command of the air, but by flying low they often threw into confusion with their machine guns the Austrian infantry. Their wonderful work in bringing in military information, and in bombing expeditions, was not excelled, if it was equaled, by the airmen of any other country. The Italian airplanes themselves were engineering triumphs. The inventive genius so notable in these days in Italy found expression in their development. Some of their machines were the biggest made during the whole war, and the long journeys made by such machines deserve special mention. The most interesting feat of this kind was performed on August 9th by the famous poet, Captain Gabrielle D\\'Annunzio. Accompanied by eight Italian machines, he flew to the city of Vienna, a total distance of 620 miles, and dropped copies of an Allied manifesto over the city. They crossed the Alps in a great wind storm at a height of ten thousand feet, and all but one returned safely. The manifesto, which was written by D\\'Annunzio reads as follows:   People of Vienna, you are fated to know the Italians. We are flying over Vienna and could drop tons of bombs. On the contrary we leave a salutation and the flag with its colors of liberty. We Italians do not make war on children, the aged and women. We make war on your government, which is the enemy of the liberty of nations,--on your blind, wanton, cruel government, which gives you neither peace nor bread, and nurtures you on hatred and delusions. People of Vienna, you have the reputation of being intelligent, why then do you wear the Prussian uniform? Now you see the entire world is against you, do you wish to continue the war? Keep on, then, but it will be your suicide. What can you hope from the victory promised to you by the Prussian generals? Their decisive victory is like the bread of the Ukraine,--one dies while awaiting it. People of Vienna, think of your dear ones, awake! Long live Italy, Liberty and the Entente!   It was said that copies of this proclamation in Vienna had a value of fifty dollars a copy. D\\'Annunzio\\'s great fame had seized upon the popular imagination. His career in the war would have been interesting in itself, but when one recognizes that he was already a world figure, the greatest modern Italian dramatist and novelist, his life seems almost like a fairy story. Before the war began he made addresses all over his country, urging Italy\\'s participation in the war, and when war was declared, to him, as much as to any other man, was due the credit. He entered the navy, and has written some fascinating descriptions of his life on board ship. Later he joined the airplane corps, and now was showering down upon the gaping populace of Vienna appeals to rise against its Hapsburg masters. D\\'Annunzio was extraordinary in his literary career. He had been the poet of passion, a writer of novels and plays, which, although artistic in the highest degree, showed him to be an egotist and a decadent. But long before the war he had tired of his erotic productions and had begun to write the praises of Nature and of heroes. He had been singing the praises of his country. \"La Nave\" symbolizes the glory of Venice. He had become more wholesome. War was making him not only a man but a hero.  Of course D\\'Annunzio was not the only great literary man who had left the study for the battle-field. AEschylus fought at Marathon and Salamis; Ariosto put down a rebellion for his prince between composition of cantos of Orlando Furioso; Sir Philip Sydney was scholar, poet and soldier, and many a soldier when his wars were over has turned to the labors of the pen. Yet it is not without surprise that one sees D\\'Annunzio join this distinguished company, and one\\'s admiration grows as it becomes plain that he was not a mere poseur. He was a poet, but he was a soldier too. Not every great poet could drive an airplane to Vienna.    CHAPTER XLVI  BULGARIA DESERTS GERMANY  During the year 1916 there was little movement in the Balkans. The Allies had settled down at Saloniki and intrenched themselves so strongly that their positions were practically impregnable. These intrenchments were on slopes facing north, heavily wired and with seven miles of swamp before them, over which an attacking army would have to pass. It was obviously inadvisable to withdraw entirely the armies at Saloniki. So long as they were there it was possible at any time to make an attack on Bulgaria in case Russia or Roumania should need such assistance. And moreover, it was evident that it was only the presence of the Saloniki army that kept Greece neutral. During the year there were a few fights which were little more than skirmishes; almost all of the German soldiers had been withdrawn, and it was chiefly the Bulgarian army that was facing the Allies. On May 26th Bulgarian forces advanced into Greece and occupied Fort Rupel, with the acquiescence of the Greek Government.  The Greeks were in a difficult position. It was not unnatural that King Constantine and the Greek General Staff believed that the Allies had small chance of victory. Moreover, they had no special ambitions which could be satisfied by a war against the Central Powers. On the other hand, Turkey was an hereditary enemy, and the big sea coast would put them at the mercy of the British navy in case they should join their fortunes to those of Austro-Germany. To an impartial observer their policy of neutrality, if not heroic, was at least wise. The Greek Government, therefore, did its best to preserve neutrality. The surrender of Fort Rupel was not, however, a neutral act and roused in Greece a strong popular protest.  Venizelos, who at all times was strongly friendly to the Allies and who was the one great Greek statesman who not only believed in their ultimate victory but who saw that the true interests of Greece were in Anatolia and the Islands of the AEgean, was strongly opposed to King Constantine\\'s action. The Allies showed their resentment by a pacific blockade, to prevent the export of coal to Greece, with the object of preventing supplies from reaching the enemy. This led to a certain amount of excitement and the Allied embassies in Athens were insulted by mobs. The governments, therefore, presented an ultimatum commanding the demobilization of the Greek army, the appointment of a neutral Ministry, and the calling of a new election for the Greek Chamber of Deputies, as well as the proper punishment of those who were guilty of the disorder.  In substance, the Greeks yielded to the Allied demand, but before a new election could be held an attack by the Bulgarians on the 17th of August changed the situation. The Bulgarian armies entered deep in Greek territory in the eastern provinces and captured the city of Kavalla without resistance from the armies of Greece. A portion of the Greek army at Kavalla surrendered and was taken to Germany as \"guests\" of the German Government.  This action of the Greek army led to a Greek revolution which broke out at Saloniki on the 30th of August. The King pursued a tortuous policy, professing neutrality and yet constantly bringing himself under suspicion. The Revolutionists organized an army and finally M. Venizelos, after strong efforts to induce the King to act, became the head of the Provisional Government of the Revolutionists. The Allies pursued a policy almost as tortuous as that of King Constantine. They could not agree among themselves as to the proper policy, and took no decided course. King Constantine apparently had the support of Russia and of Italy.  Meantime the fighting against Bulgaria was still proceeding. The main force of the Allies was directed against the city of Monastir, which, after considerable fighting, was captured on November 19th. This gave the Serbians possession of an important point in their own country and naturally proved a great stimulus to the Serbian armies.  From that time on, and during the year 1917, little was done. Minor offensives were undertaken, some of which, like the Allied attack upon Doiran, deserve mention, but on the whole the fighting was a stalemate. Meanwhile the action of the Greek Government had become so unsatisfactory that it was finally determined to demand the abdication of King Constantine, and on June 11th he found himself compelled to yield. In his proclamation he said:   Obeying necessity of fulfilling my duty toward Greece, I am departing from my beloved country accompanied by the heir to the crown, and I leave my son Alexander on the throne. I beg you to accept my decision with calm.   Early the next morning the King and his family set sail for Italy on his way to Switzerland, where he became another \"King in exile.\" His son Alexander accepted the throne and issued the following proclamation:   At the moment when my august father, making a supreme sacrifice to our dear country, entrusted to me the heavy duties of the Hellenic throne I express but one single wish--that God, hearing his prayer, will protect Greece, that He will permit us to see her again united and powerful. In my grief at being separated in circumstances so critical from my well-beloved father I have a single consolation: to carry out his sacred mandate which I will endeavor to realize with all my power, following the lines of his brilliant reign, with the help of the people upon whose love the Greek dynasty is supported. I am convinced that in obeying the wishes of my father the people by their submission will do their part in enabling us together to rescue our dear country from the terrible situation in which it finds itself.   The whole country to all appearances received the abdication with satisfaction. On June 21st, M. Venizelos came to Athens and the Greek Chamber, which was illegally dissolved in 1915, was convoked and Venizelos once again became Prime Minister. At last he had succeeded, and he proceeded at once to join the whole of the Grecian forces to the cause of the Allies. Of all the statesmen prominent in the Great War, there was none more wise, more consistent or more loyal than the great Greek statesman.  For more than a year the Allied armies facing Bulgaria remained upon the defensive, when, suddenly, on the 16th of September, 1918, in the midst of the wonderful movements that were forcing back the German armies in France, a dispatch was received from the Allied forces in Macedonia. The Serbian army, in co-operation with French and English forces, had attacked the Bulgarian positions on a ten-mile front, had stormed those positions and progressed more than five miles. On the next day news was received that the advance was continuing; that the Allies had occupied an important series of ridges, and had pierced the Bulgarian front; that more than three thousand prisoners had been captured and twenty-four guns. The movement took place about twelve miles east of Monastir and the ridge of Sokol, and the town of Gradeshnitsa were captured by the Allied troops.  It soon became evident that one of the most important movements in the whole war was being carried on. The Bulgarian armies were crumbling, and the German troops sent to aid them had been put to flight. The Allied troops had advanced on an average of ten miles and were continuing to advance. The Serbs, fighting at last near their own homes, were showing their real military strength. Four thousand prisoners had been taken, with an enormous quantity of war supplies. The Bulgarian positions which had yielded so easily were positions which they had been fortifying for three years, and had been previously thought to be impregnable.  On September 23d it became evident that the retreat of the Bulgarians had turned into a rout. Notwithstanding reinforcements of Germans and Bulgars rushed down in a frantic effort to check them, the Allied armies were advancing on an eighty-five mile front, crushing all resistance. The Italian army, on the west, was meeting with equal success, and the news dispatches reported that the first Bulgarian army in the region of Prilep had been cut off. A dispatch received by the British War Office reported \"As the result of attacks and continual heavy pressure by British and Greek troops, in conjunction with the French and Serbian advance farther west, the enemy has evacuated his whole line from Doiran to the west of the Vardar.\" As it retreated the Bulgarian army was burning supplies and destroying ammunition dumps, burning railway stations and ravaging the country.  By this time it was felt throughout the Allied world that the Bulgarian defeat would have important political consequences. It was remembered that a short time before King Ferdinand had paid a visit to Germany, and after long conferences with the German War Lord, had hastily returned to Bulgaria. It was recalled that there had been many signs of serious disorder in Bulgaria, where the Socialist party had been in close touch with the advance parties in the Ukrainian Republic. It seemed possible that the Bulgarian defeats had been brought about by Bulgarian dissension and it was also evident that Germany was in no position to offer effective support to its Bulgarian accomplice.  As the days passed by the news from this front became more and more favorable. At all points the Bulgarian armies were retreating in the most disorderly manner, closely pursued by the Serbians, French, English, Italians, and Greeks. Bulgarian troops were deserting in thousands, and thousands of others were surrendering without resistance.  On September 26th it was announced that the Bulgar front had disappeared; that the armies had been cut into a number of groups and were fleeing before the Allied troops. Town after town was being captured, with enormous quantities of stores. On Friday, September 27th, it was announced that Bulgaria had asked the Allies for an armistice of forty-eight hours, with a view to making peace.  The situation was now causing intense excitement. The Germans tried to minimize the Bulgarian surrender. A dispatch from Berlin declared that Premier Malinoff\\'s offer of an armistice was made without the support of other members of the Cabinet or of King Ferdinand, and that Germany would make a solemn protest against it. German newspapers were demanding that Malinoff be dismissed immediately and court-martialed for high treason. The Berlin message asserted that the Premier\\'s offer had created great dissatisfaction in Bulgaria and that strong military measures had been taken to support the Bulgarian front. According to statements from Sofia it was added a counter-movement against the action of the Premier had already been set on foot. It was declared in Germany that the Premier\\'s act was the result of Germany\\'s refusal to send sufficient reinforcements to Bulgaria. Secretary Lansing made the announcement that the United States Government had received a proposal for an armistice.  It appeared that Bulgaria had been maneuvering toward peace for some time. The Bulgarians had foreseen their inability to meet the expected Allied attack, and had made every effort to obtain German reinforcements. Moreover, they were highly dissatisfied with the treatment they had received from Germany in connection with Bulgaria\\'s dispute with Turkey as to territorial dispositions to be made after the war. Probably the most important reason, however, for the Bulgarian overthrow was that by this time they were sick of the war. They had not, in the first place, gone into it with any enthusiasm, and though they could fight bravely enough against their Serbian foe, no true Bulgarian could ever feel himself in a natural position facing his old-time Russian friend.  Bulgaria had come to the end. Malinoff, the Premier, had from the beginning been opposed to the war. Mobs in Sofia were demanding surrender. Ferdinand was compelled to give way to the wishes of his Cabinet and his people, and in spite of the fact that he had promised the Kaiser to remain faithful to the Alliance, he gave his consent to the movement for unconditional surrender.  An official Bulgarian statement read as follows: \"In view of the conjunction of circumstances which have recently arisen, and after the position had been jointly discussed with all competent authorities, the Bulgarian Government, desiring to put an end to the bloodshed, has authorized the Commander-in-Chief of the army to propose to the Generalissimo of the armies of the Entente at Saloniki, a cessation of hostilities, and the entering into of negotiations for obtaining an armistice and peace. The members of the Bulgarian delegation left yesterday evening in order to get into touch with the Plenipotentiaries of the Entente belligerents.\" This statement was dated September 24th.  When the Bulgarian officers entrusted with the proposal for an armistice presented themselves at Saloniki, General d\\'Esperey gave the following reply: \"My response cannot be, by reason of the military situation, other than the following. I can accord neither an armistice nor a suspension of hostilities tending to interrupt the operations in course. On the other hand, I will receive with all due courtesy the delegates duly qualified of the Royal Bulgarian Government.\" The Bulgarian delegates were General Lonkhoff, commander of the Bulgarian Second Army, M. Liapcheff, Finance Minister, and M. Radeff, a former member of the Bulgarian Cabinet.  On the evening of the 29th an armistice was signed. The terms of the surrender were approved by the Entente governments, and hostilities ceased at noon September 30th. The terms of the armistice were as follows:   Bulgaria agrees to evacuate all the territory she now occupies in Greece and Serbia; to demobilize her army immediately and surrender all means of transport to the Allies. Bulgaria also will surrender her boats and control of navigation on the Danube, and concede to the Allies free passage through Bulgaria for the development of military operations. All Bulgarian arms and ammunition are to be stored under the control of the Allies, to whom is conceded the right to occupy all important strategic points. The military occupation of Bulgaria will be entrusted to British, French and Italian forces, and the evacuated portions of Greece and Serbia, respectively, to Greek and Serbian troops.   This armistice meant a complete military surrender, and Bulgaria ceased to be a belligerent. All questions of territorial rearrangement in the Balkans were purposely omitted from the Convention. The Allies made no stipulation concerning King Ferdinand, his position being considered an internal matter, one for the Bulgarians themselves to deal with. The armistice was to remain in operation until the final general peace was concluded.  The request of Bulgaria for an armistice and peace, stunned Germany, which at that time was living in an atmosphere of political crisis and military misfortune. The German papers laid much of the blame on the desperate economic conditions in Bulgaria, which had been made worse by political strife.  After the Bulgarian collapse the Serbians, with the other Allied troops who had just captured Uskub, swept northward to drive the remaining Germans and Austrians out of Serbia and beyond the Danube. On October 13th they captured Nish, thus cutting the famous Orient railroad from Berlin to Constantinople. German authorities announced that henceforth trains on this line would run only to the Serbian border.  On October 4th King Ferdinand abdicated his throne in favor of his son Crown Prince Boris, and left Sofia the same night for Vienna. Before leaving he issued the following manifesto renouncing the Bulgarian crown:   By reason of the succession of events which have occurred in my kingdom, and which demand a sacrifice from each citizen, even to the surrendering of oneself for the well being of all, I desire to give as the first example the sacrifice of myself. Despite the sacred ties, which for thirty-two years have bound me so firmly to this country, for whose prosperity and greatness I have given all my powers, I have decided to renounce the royal Bulgarian crown in favor of my eldest son, His Highness the Prince Royal Boris of Tirnovo. I call upon all faithful subjects and true patriots to unite as one man about the throne of King Boris, to lift the country from its difficult situation, and to elevate new Bulgaria to the height to which it is predestined.   Before signing his declaration of abdication he had consulted with the party leaders and received their approval. King Ferdinand had lost his popularity ever since it became apparent that he had made a mistake in siding with the Teutonic Powers. He was undoubtedly in fear that a revolution might upset the whole dynasty. Premier Malinoff announced the abdication to the Bulgarian Parliament, and the accession of Prince Boris to the throne was received with much enthusiasm. The church bells were rung, and great crowds gathered in the streets.  Speaking from the steps of the Palace the new King said; \"I thank you for your manifestation of patriotic sentiments. I have faith in the good star of Bulgaria, and I believe that the Bulgar people, by their good qualities and co-operation, are directed to a brilliant future.\" King Ferdinand, it was given out, had renounced politics and was intending in the future to devote himself to his favorite pursuits, chiefly to botany.  The surrender of Bulgaria was at once recognized as the overthrow of Germany\\'s \"Mittel-Europa\" threat, which had apparently been carried into effect when Turkey and Bulgaria joined the Central Powers. It had for a long time been one of Germany\\'s most coveted aims. After the Franco-Prussian war the German people had grown enormously in wealth and in numbers. It had become one of the greatest manufacturing powers in the world. Its ships were transporting its commerce on every sea, but it was not satisfied. The German leaders, most of whom were young men at the time of the war with France, and had been deeply impressed by a sense of the German power, were full of the idea that Germany was the greatest of nations, and that she should impress her will on all the world.  They might have done this peacefully, for the seas were free, but German self-esteem was not satisfied with peaceful progress. They felt that it was necessary to reach out in the world for colonies. They seized a province in China. They meddled with affairs in Morocco. They annexed colonies in Africa, but none of these projects were wholly satisfactory. They provided no great outlet for the products of their workshops, nor for their overflow population, which largely went to North and South America and became citizens of these foreign nations.  Their eyes finally turned to the great East. There in China and India and the neighboring countries were three hundred millions of men whose trade would be a worthy prize for even Germany\\'s ambition. Then began the development of what is sometimes called Germany\\'s Mittel-Europa dream. Her scholars encouraged it; her travelers brought reports which stimulated the interest, and soon she began practically to carry it into effect. It meant the building of a great railroad down to the Persian Gulf; a railroad to be controlled by nations where her influence would be all-powerful. She needed Austria, she needed Serbia, she needed Bulgaria and Turkey.   [Illustration: Map: Most of Asia, Africa and Australia, showing Germany\\'s hoped for rail and ship routes from the North Sea to Australia, South Africa and China.]   HOW THE PAN-GERMANS PLANNED TO EXTEND THEIR \"MITTEL-EUROPA\" DREAM   At first the project was carried out peacefully. Friendly relations were stimulated with Turkey and the other necessary powers; permits were obtained to build the railroad. But Germany was not the only power that had dreamed this dream. Alexander the Great had done it. Napoleon had done it, and England had carried it out. From the days of Queen Elizabeth the English control of India was one of its greatest assets.  Through most of the nineteenth century the English power in the East was threatened, not by Germany, but by Russia. It was because of this threat that England had always protected Turkey. Turkey and Constantinople were her barrier against Russia. The literature of England in the last days of the nineteenth century shows clearly her fear of Russian intrigues in India. Kipling\\'s Indian stories are full of it. But now that fear had passed. It was no longer the imaginary danger which might come from the great Slavic Empire, but a trade weapon in the grasp of the most efficient military power ever developed that was threatening. Against this threat England had been doing her best. Here and there near the Persian Gulf she had been extending her influence. Here and there, as German Consuls obtained concessions, they would find them later withdrawn, because England had stepped in. Yet just before the war England, anxious for peace, had come to an agreement with Germany practically admitting the German plans to be carried out as far as Bagdad.  It looked as though it were only a question of time, but when the Balkan wars established Serbia as the greatest of the Balkan powers, and gave Russia a preponderating influence among the Balkan nations, and when it began to look as if some great Balkan state might be established which should be friendly to Russia and consequently a hindrance to the German scheme, then it was that it was necessary that war should come. The Germans had been wonderfully successful. For a time they controlled Austria, Bulgaria, Serbia and Turkey, but with Bulgaria\\'s fall the end had come. They were compelled to awake from their Mittel-Europa dream.   [Illustration: Photograph]   Copyright Press Illustrating Service   BULGARIANS CELEBRATE PEACE   The first peace picture.

CHAPTER XLVII  THE CENTRAL EMPIRES WHINE FOR PEACE  The Allied victories in France during the months of August and September of 1918, led to a new peace offensive among the Central Powers. It was very plain to the German High Command, as well as to the Allied leaders, that Germany\\'s great ambitions had now been definitely thwarted. It seems clear that, in spite of the hopeful and encouraging words which they addressed to their own armies, the expert soldiers, who were controlling the destinies of Germany, understood well the conditions they were facing. Putting aside all sentiment, therefore, they deliberately set out to obtain a peace which would leave them an opportunity to gain by diplomacy what they were sure that they were about to lose on the field of battle. They had made pleas for peace before, but their pleas had been rejected.  The Allied leaders were fighting for a principle. They could not be satisfied with a draw. They could not be satisfied if Germany were left in a position which would enable her after a rest of a few years to renew her effort to impose her will upon the world. It was unanimously recognized that the war must be carried on to the very end. The Allies took this position when the fortunes of war seemed to have gone against them, when Russia was defeated, Roumania and Serbia crushed, and the German lines in France were approaching the capital. It was unlikely that now, when Germany was suffering defeat and every day was yielding the Allied armies encouraging gains, there should be any change in the strong determination of the Allied leaders. Nevertheless, it was necessary to make the attempt.  On September 15th, the Austro-Hungarian Government addressed a communication to the Allied Powers and to the Holy See suggesting a meeting for a confidential and non-binding discussion of war aims, with a view to the possible calling of a peace conference.  The official communication from the Austro-Hungarian Government was handed to Secretary of State Lansing in Washington at 6.20 o\\'clock on September 16th.  At 6.45 the following abbreviated reply of the United States Government was made public, by the Secretary of State:   I am authorized by the President to state that the following will be the reply of this government to the Austro-Hungarian note proposing an unofficial conference of belligerents. \"The Government of the United States feels that there is only one reply which it can make to the suggestion of the Austro-Hungarian Government. It has repeatedly and with entire candor stated the terms upon which the United States would consider peace, and can and will entertain no proposal for a conference upon the matter concerning which it has made its position and purpose so plain.\"   Arthur J. Balfour, the British Foreign Secretary, in a statement made September 16th said: \"It is incredible that anything can come of this proposal.... This cynical proposal of the Austrian Government is not a genuine attempt to obtain peace. It is an attempt to divide the Allies.\" Premier Clemenceau in France took similar grounds, and stated in the French Senate: \"We will fight until the hour when the enemy comes to understand that bargaining between crime and right is no longer possible. We want a just and a strong peace, protecting the future against the abominations of the past.\" Italy joined with her Allies and declared that a negotiated peace was impossible.  The refusal on the part of the Allies to respond to the Austrian peace proposal evidently greatly disturbed the German leaders. The continued German reverses, and the surrender of Bulgaria had taken away all hope. They were anxious to conclude some kind of peace before meeting irretrievable disaster. They therefore determined to appoint as Chancellor of the Empire some statesman who might be represented as a supporter of an honest peace, and Count von Hertling, whose previous utterances might put under suspicion any peace move coming from him, was removed and Prince Maximilian of Baden appointed as his successor on September 30th.  Prince Maximilian was put forward as a Moderate, in accordance with the evident purpose of the government to continue peace proposals. He was the heir apparent to the Grand Ducal throne of Baden, and was the first man in public life in Germany to declare that the Empire could not conquer by the sword alone. He did this in an address to the Upper Chamber in Baden, of which he was President, on December 15, 1917. \"Power alone can never secure our position,\" he said, \"and our sword alone will never be able to tear down the opposition to us.\"  At the same time he made an attack upon the ideals set up by President Wilson. \"President Wilson,\" he continued, \"after three years of war gathers together all the outworn slogans of the Entente of 1914, and denounces Germany as the disturber of the peace, proclaiming a crusade for humanity, liberty and the rights of small nations.\" Then, forgetting that the United States had entered the war nearly a month after the abdication of the Czar of Russia, he added: \"President Wilson has no right to speak in the name of democracy and liberty, for he was the mighty war ally of Russian Czardom, but he had deaf ears when the Russian democracy appealed to him to allow it to discuss peace conditions.\" The Baden address created a great sensation all over Germany, which was increased when, in an interview in January, he declared that all ideas of conquest must be abandoned, and that Germany must serve as a bulwark to prevent the spread of Bolshevism among the western nations.  There can be no doubt that the appointment of Prince Maximilian was a definite attempt to seek peace. It was thought that he would be recognized by the Allied leaders as an honest friend of peace, and that any effort he would make would be treated with respect. He was, however, a vigorous supporter of the Kaiser and of German autocracy, and while his appointment might mean that Germany was desirous of peace it did not mean that she had changed her ways. Three days before the appointment of Prince Maximilian, President Wilson, in an address delivered in the Metropolitan Opera House in New York, had restated the issues of the war, declaring (1) for impartial justice, (2) settlement to be made in the common interests of all, (3) no leagues within the common family of the league of nations, (4) no selfish economic combination within that league, and (5) all international agreements and treaties of every kind must be made known in their entirety to the rest of the world.  Prince Maximilian, coming into power undoubtedly for the purpose of arranging a peace, proceeded at once to make a new peace offer. He based his action on President Wilson\\'s speech and on October 4th sent to President Wilson, through the Swiss Government, the following note:   The German Government requests the President of the United States to take in hand the restoration of peace, acquaint all the belligerent states with this request, and invite them to send plenipotentiaries for the purpose of opening negotiations. It accepts the program set forth by the President of the United States in his message to Congress on January 8th, and in his later pronouncements, especially his speech of September 27th, as a basis for peace negotiations. With a view to avoiding further bloodshed the German Government requests the immediate conclusion of an armistice on land and on water and in the air.   He followed this note on October 5th with an address before the German Reichstag, of which the following are the most important points:   In accordance with the Imperial decree of September 30th, the German Empire has undergone a basic alteration of its politic leadership. As successor to Count George F. von Hertling, whose services in behalf of the Fatherland deserve the highest acknowledgment, I have been summoned by the Emperor to lead the new government. In accordance with the governmental method now introduced I submit to the Reichstag, publicly and without delay, the principles by which I propose to conduct the grave responsibilities of the office. These principles were firmly established by the agreement of the federated governments and the leaders of the majority parties in this honorable House before I decided to assume the duties of Chancellor. They contain therefore not only my own confession of political faith, but that of an overwhelming portion of the German people\\'s representatives--that is, of the German nation--which has constituted the Reichstag on the basis of a general, equal, and secret franchise and according to their will.  Only the fact that I know the conviction and will of the majority of the people are back of me, has given me strength to take upon myself conduct of the Empire\\'s affairs in this hard and earnest time in which we are living. One man\\'s shoulders would be too weak to carry alone the tremendous responsibility which falls upon the government at present. Only if the people take active part in the broader sense of the word in deciding their destinies, in other words, if responsibility also extends to the majority of their freely elected political leaders, can the leading statesman confidently assume his part of the responsibility in the service of folk and Fatherland.  My resolve to this has been especially lightened for me by the fact that prominent leaders of the laboring class have found a way in the new government to the highest offices of the Empire. I see therein a sure guarantee that the new government will be supported by the confidence of the broad masses of the people, without whose true support the whole undertaking would be compelled to failure in advance. Hence what I say today is not only in my own name, and those of my official helpers, but in the name of the German people.  The program of the majority parties, upon which I take my stand, contains first, an acceptance of the answer of the former Imperial Government to Pope Benedict\\'s note of August 1, 1916, and an unconditional acceptance of the Reichstag resolution of July 19th, the same year. It further declares willingness to join the general league of nations based on the foundation of equal rights for all, both strong and weak. It considers the solution of the Belgian question to lie in the complete rehabilitation of Belgium, particularly of its independence and territorial integrity. An effort shall also be made to reach an understanding on the question of indemnity. The program will not permit the peace treaties hitherto concluded to be a hindrance to the conclusion of the general peace. Its particular aim is that popular representative bodies shall be formed immediately on a broad basis in the Baltic provinces, in Lithuania and Poland. We will promote the realization of necessary preliminary conditions therefore without delay by the introduction of civilian rule. All these lands shall regulate their constitutions and their relations with neighboring peoples without external interference.   He went on to point out the progressive political developments in Prussia and declared that the \"message of the King of Prussia promising the democratic franchise must be fulfilled quickly and completely.\"  President Wilson did not find Prince Maximilian\\'s proposal wholly satisfactory, and on October 8th, he inquired of the Imperial Chancellor whether the meaning of the proposal was that the German Government accepted the terms laid down in his address to the Congress of the United States and in subsequent addresses; and whether its object in entering into discussions would be only to agree upon the practical details of their application. He also suggested that so long as the armies of the Central Powers were upon the soil of the governments with which the United States was associated, he would not feel at liberty to propose a cessation of arms to those governments. He also inquired whether the Imperial Chancellor was speaking merely for the constituted authorities of the Empire, who had so far conducted the war.  President Wilson\\'s reply aroused much difference of opinion among the Allies, but on the whole was regarded as a clever diplomatic move.  The German Government responded to these questions of the President on October 12th, by a message signed by Dr. W. S. Solf, who had just been appointed Imperial Foreign Secretary. In this reply the German Government declared that it did accept President Wilson\\'s terms; that it was ready to comply with the suggestion of the President and withdraw its troops from Allied territory, and that the German Government was representing in all its actions the will of the great majority of the German people.  Germany had, indeed, made enormous concessions, and the German people appeared to have taken for granted that such an offer would be accepted. An Amsterdam despatch declared: \"People in Berlin are kissing one another in the street, though they are perfect strangers and shouting peace congratulations to each other. The only words heard anywhere in Germany are \\'Peace at last\\'.\"  The President however, had been struck by the news coming in from day to day of new atrocities in France, and of new cases of submarine murders, and in his reply of October 14th, he declared that while he was ready to refer the question of an armistice to the judgment and advice of military advisers of the government of the United States and the Allied governments, he felt sure that none of those governments would consent to consider an armistice as long as the armed forces of Germany continued the illegal and inhuman practices which they were persisting in. He also emphasized the fact that no armistice would be accepted that would not provide absolutely satisfactory safeguards and guarantees of the maintenance of the military supremacy of the armies of the United States and of the Allies in the field. The President also called the attention of the Government of Germany to that clause of his address on the Fourth of July in which he had demanded \"the destruction of every arbitrary power that can separately, secretly and of its single choice disturb the peace of the world, or, if it cannot be presently destroyed, at least its reduction to virtual impotency.\" He declared that the power which had hitherto controlled the German nation was of the sort thus described, and that its alteration actually constituted a condition precedent to peace.  This answer of the President was greeted with approval in the United States and everywhere in the Allied countries. It meant that the Imperial Power of Germany was not to be allowed to hide itself behind a so-called reorganization done under its own direction. As one of the Senators of the United States expressed it: \"It is an unequivocal demand that the Hohenzollerns shall get out.\"  During these negotiations the Allied armies under Marshal Foch had been driving the enemy before them. When Baron Burian was making his peace offer on behalf of Austria-Hungary the Americans were engaged in pinching off the St. Mihiel salient, and about that date the British were launching their great attack on the St. Quentin defenses. The reports of the great Allied drive indicated a constant succession of Allied victories.  On September 19th, the British advanced into the Hindenburg line, northwest of St. Quentin, and on September 20th, while the American guns were shelling Metz, the British were advancing steadily near Cambrai and La Bassee.  Day by day the advance proceeded. On September 26th, the first American army smashed through the Hindenburg line for an average gain of seven miles, between the Meuse and the Aisne rivers on a twenty-mile front. On September 27th, the French gained five miles in an advance east of Rheims, and the British were attacking in the Cambrai sector on a fourteen-mile front, crossing the Canal du Nord and piercing the Hindenburg line at several points. On September 28th, the Americans reached the Kriemhilde line, while the British were close in on Cambrai. On September 30th, the British took Messines Ridge, while the French were still advancing between the Aisne and Vesle Rivers. On October 1st, the French troops entered St. Quentin and the British took the northern and western suburbs of Cambrai. During the next week an enveloping movement was instituted north and south of Lille. On October 5th, the Germans evacuated Lille, on October 9th the British took Cambrai.  In these drives the American colored troops played a conspicuous part. The entire Three hundred and sixty-fifth regiment, composed wholly of colored troops, was later awarded the coveted Croix de Guerre, or War Cross, by the French Government. It was a well-deserved honor, for the boys of the Three hundred and sixty-fifth bore themselves with great gallantry in the September and October offensive in the Champagne sector and suffered heavy losses. In conferring the Croix de Guerre, the citation dealt in considerable detail with the valor of particular officers and praised the courage and tenacity of the whole regiment.  The Germans were retreating in Belgium day by day, under the attacks of the Belgian and French armies. On October 11th the Germans evacuated the Chemin des Dames. On October 16th the Germans began the evacuation of the Belgian coast region and each day increased the number of Belgian towns once more in Allied control.    CHAPTER XLVIII  BATTLES IN THE AIR  He who conquers the fear of death is master of his fate. Upon this philosophy fifty thousand young men of the warring nations went forth to do battle among the clouds. The story of these battles is the real romance of the World War. In 1914 no one had ever known and history had never recorded a struggle to the death in the air. When the war ended a new literature of adventure had been created, a literature emblazoned with superb heroisms, with God-like daring, and with such utter disdain of death that they were raised out of the olden ranks of mere earth-crawling mankind and became supermen of the air.  Some of these heroic names became household words during the war. These were the aces of the French, American and German air-forces. The British adopted a policy in news concerning their airmen similar to that governing their publication of submarine sinkings. They argued that the naming of British, Canadian and Australian aces would direct the attacks of German aviators against the most useful men in the British forces. They also felt that publicity would tend toward the swagger which in English slang was \"swank\" and toward a deterioration in discipline.  Raoul Lufberry, Quentin Roosevelt, son of ex-President Roosevelt, and Edward Rickenbacher were names that figured extensively in news of the American air forces.  Lufberry and Roosevelt were killed in action. Rickenbacher, after dozens of hair-raising escapes from death, came through the war without injury. The pioneer of American aviators in the war was William Thaw of Yale, who formed the original Lafayette Escadrille.  Besides these men, America produced a number of other brilliant aces, an ace being one who brought down five enemy planes, each victory being attested by at least three witnesses.  The French had as their outstanding aces Georges Guynemer and Rene Fonck. Guynemer went into the flying game as a mechanician. He became the most formidable human fighting machine on the western front before he was sent to death in a blazing airplane.  Lieut. Rene Fonck ended the war with a total of seventy-five official aerial victories. He had an additional forty Huns to his credit but not officially confirmed. His greatest day was when he brought down six planes. His quickest work was the shooting down of three Germans in twenty seconds.  He fought three distinct battles in the air when, on May 8, 1918, he brought down six German airplanes in one day. All three engagements were fought within two hours. In all, Fonck fired only fifty-six shots, an average of little more than nine bullets for each enemy brought down--an extraordinary record, in view of the fact that aviators often fired hundreds of rounds without crippling their opponent.  The first fight, in which Lieutenant Fonck brought down three German machines, lasted only a minute and a half, and the young Frenchman fired only twenty-two shots. Fonck was leading two other companions on a patrol in the Moreuil-Montdidier sector on May 8th, when the French squadron met three German two-seater airplanes coming toward them in arrow formation. Signaling to his companions, Lieutenant Fonck dived at the leading German plane and, with a few shots sent it down in flames. Fonck turned to the left, and the second enemy flier followed in an effort to attack him from behind, but the Frenchman made a quick turn above him and, with five shots, sent the second German to death. Ten seconds had barely elapsed between the two victories.  The third enemy pilot headed for home, but when Lieutenant Fonck apparently gave up the chase and turned back toward the French lines the German went after him, and was flying parallel and a little below, when Fonck made a quick turn, drove straight at him and sent him down within half a mile of the spot where his two comrades hit the earth.  The German heroes were the celebrated Captain Boelke, and the no less famous inventor of the \"flying circus,\" Count von Richthofen. Captain Boelke caused a great many Allied \"crashes\" by hiding in clouds and diving straight at planes flying beneath him. As he came within range, he opened up with a stream of machine-gun bullets. If he failed to get his prey, his rush carried him past his opponent into safety. He rarely re-attacked. Count von Richthofen was responsible for many airplane squadron tactics that later were used on both sides. The planes under his command were gaily painted for easy identification during the thick of a fight. Their usual method was to cut off single planes or small groups of Allied planes, and to circle around them in the method employed by Admiral Dewey for the reduction of the Spanish forts and ships in the Battle of Manila Bay.  The dangers of aerial warfare were instrumental in producing high chivalry in all the encampments of air men. Graves of fallen aviators were marked and decorated by their former foes, and captured aviators received exceptionally good treatment, where foemen aviators could procure such treatment for them.  Until the advent of America into the war, neither side had a marked advantage in aircraft. At first Germany had a slight advantage; then the balance swung to the Allied side; but at no time was the scale tipped very much. American quantity production of airplanes, however, gave to the Entente Allies an overwhelming advantage. Final standardization of tools and design for the \"Soul of the American Airplane\" was not accomplished until February, 1918. Yet within eight months more than 15,000 Liberty engines, each of them fully tested and of the highest quality, were delivered.  The United States did not follow European types of engines, but in a wonderfully short time developed an engine standardized in the most recent efficiency of American industries.  According to Secretary of War Baker, an inspiring feature of this work was the aid rendered by consulting engineers and motor manufacturers, who gave up their trade secrets under the emergency of war needs. Realizing that the new design would be a government design and no firm or individual would reap selfish benefit because of its making, the motor manufacturers, nevertheless, patriotically revealed their trade secrets and made available trade processes of great commercial value. These industries also contributed the services of approximately two hundred of their best draftsmen. Parts of the first engine were turned out at twelve different factories, located all the way from Connecticut to California. When the parts were assembled the adjustment was perfect and the performance of the engine was wonderfully gratifying.  Thirty days after the assembling of the first engine preliminary tests justified the government in formally accepting the engine as the best aircraft engine produced in any country. The final tests confirmed the faith in the new motor.  British and French machines as a rule were not adapted to American manufacturing methods. They were highly specialized machines, requiring much hand work from mechanics, who were, in fact, artisans.  The standardized United States aviation engine, produced under government supervision, said Secretary of War Baker, was expected \"to solve the problem of building first-class, powerful and yet comparatively delicate aviation engines by American machine methods--the same standardized methods which revolutionized the automobile industry in this country.\"  The manufacture of De Haviland airplanes equipped with Liberty motors was a factor in the war. One of these De Havilands without tuning up, made a non-stop trip on November 11, 1918, from Dayton, Ohio, to Washington, D. C., a distance of 430 miles, in three hours and fifty minutes. Great battle squadrons of these De Haviland planes equipped with Liberty motors made bombing raids over the German lines in the Verdun sector. Others operated as scouting and reconnaissance planes and as spotters for American artillery.  In the period from September 12th to 11 o\\'clock on the morning on November 11th, the American aviators brought down 473 German machines. Of this number, 353 were confirmed officially. Day bombing groups, from the time they began operations, dropped a total of 116,818 kilograms of bombs within the German lines.  Bombing operations were begun in August by the 96th Squadron, which in five flying days dropped 18,080 kilograms of bombs. The first day bombardment group began work in September, the group including the 96th, the 20th and 11th Squadrons. The 166th Squadron joined the group in November.  In twelve flying days in September the bombers dropped 3,466 kilograms of bombs; in fifteen flying days in October, 46,133 kilograms, and in four flying days in November, 17,979 kilograms.  On November 11th, the day of the signing of the armistice, there were actually engaged on the front 740 American planes, 744 pilots, 457 observers and 23 aerial gunners.  Of the total number of planes, 329 were of the pursuit type, 296 were for observation and 115 were bombers. In addition, several hundred planes of various types were being used at the instruction camps when the war ended.  America, although the last of the great nations to embark upon a great aircraft production program, was the birthplace of the airplane, the Wright Brothers being the undisputed inventors of the modern type.  Wilbur and Orville Wright made their first experiments in flying at Kittyhawk, N. C. Their first attempts were of a gliding nature and were accomplished by starting from the top of a dune or sand hill, the operator lying full length, face downward, on the under plane of the machine. During these experiments they succeeded in flying six hundred feet.  Their first flight with an airplane driven by a motor was on December 17, 1903, when they succeeded in flying about two hundred and seventy yards in fifty-nine seconds. This machine was driven by a sixteen-horse-power motor.  Santos Dumont was one of the early pioneers in aeronautical experiments. After showing a marked talent with balloons, he turned his attention to heavier-than-air machines, and in 1906 created a world\\'s record in a flight of 230 yards at a speed of twenty-five miles an hour.  In 1907 Henry Farnum made a half circular flight in a Voisin biplane, using a fifty-horse-power motor, returning to his starting point. About this time a flight of nine minutes and fifteen seconds was recorded by Delagrande on a Voisin constructed biplane.  The first previously announced public flight was made on July 4, 1908, by Glenn H. Curtiss at Hammondsport, N. Y., and was witnessed by a number of New Yorkers who had gone to Hammondsport to see the flight.  In the winter of 1913-14 Mr. Rodman Wanamaker gave Glenn H. Curtiss a commission to build a flying boat which would fly across the Atlantic. Commander Porte was brought from England, and he, with Mr. Curtiss, worked out the designs for a flying boat much larger than any previously built, and fitted with two motors instead of one. As entirely separate power plants would be used, one motor would naturally run somewhat faster than the other, and it was freely predicted that the machine could not be handled. The first trial, however, proved that it would not only fly, but that after it was once in the air, one motor could be slowed down and even stopped and the machine continue to fly. This machine was the forerunner of the seaplane, used by the American, British and other navies in the war, although somewhat changed in detail. The beginning of the war stopped the transatlantic experiments and this machine found its way into the British navy. It was christened the \"America,\" and the larger flying boats or seaplanes which are now being built and used by the British and American navies are still known as the \"America\" or super-American type.  At first fighting operations were carried out by individual aviators or comparatively small squadrons, but the battles of March, 1918, witnessed the definite development of larger squadrons, maneuvering as effectively as bodies of cavalry, and in massed formation attacking infantry columns. The possibilities of the new aerial arm were further demonstrated in the creation of a barrage, as effective as that of heavy artillery, for the purpose of holding back advancing bodies of infantry.  In the first days of the German offensive there took place an aerial battle which up to that time was unique in the annals of warfare. It was a battle not merely for the purpose of gaining the mastery of the air, but to aid Allied infantry and artillery in stemming the tide of the German advance, and when the drive finally slowed down and came to a halt in Picardy, the Allied airmen had undoubtedly contributed largely to the result.  During March 21 and 22, 1918--the opening days of the great German drive--there was comparatively little aerial activity. The aviators of both sides were preparing for the impending battle, which actually began on the morning of March 23d and lasted all that day and the day following.  The story of the air battle of March 23d-24th reads like one of the most extraordinary adventure tales ever imagined. The struggle began with squadrons of airplanes ascending and maneuvering as perfectly as cavalry. They rose to dizzy heights, and, descending, swept the air close to the ground. The individual pilots of the opposing sides then began executing all manner of movements, climbing, diving, turning in every direction, and seeking to get into the best position to pour machine-gun fire into enemy airplanes. Every few minutes a machine belonging to an Allied or German squadron crashed to the ground, often in flames. At the end of the first day\\'s fighting wrecked airplanes and the mangled bodies of aviators lay strewn all over the battle-field.  All next day, March 24th, the struggle in the air went on with unabated fury. The Allied air squadrons were now on the offensive and penetrated far inside the German lines. The German aviators counter-attacked whenever they could, and more than once succeeded in crossing the French lines. But at the close of the second day victory rested with the Allied airmen, and during the next five scarcely a German airplane took the air.  The sudden termination of the war caused speculation throughout the world concerning the future of the airplane. When rumor declared that America\\'s newly-won pre-eminence in aviation would disappear, Captain Roy N. Francis, of the Division of Military Aeronautics, made this statement.   America cannot afford to junk the airplane fleet which has cost her so many millions of dollars. I do not believe that any other nation will do so. Even if the peace congress should decide on universal disarmament, there are still any number of uses to which airplanes can be put in time of peace.  Take the air mail service, for instance. This is now only in its infancy, but it is destined to become as common as the railway mail service. It will employ hundreds of airplanes and aviators all over the country.  Then there is the possibility of our machines being used for seacoast patrol work, a valuable addition to our coast-guard forces which save many ocean vessels from disaster every year.  They will be largely used for army dispatch work. Instead of sending official messages from post to post by the present methods, airplanes will be used after the war as they are now being used at the front.  On the Great Lakes, airplanes can be used for coast-guard work, as on the seacoast, and they can also be used for patrolling the lakes themselves. Think how many wrecked lake vessels might have been saved in the past had there been an airplane nearby to carry its message of distress and guide rescue ships to the scene.  Forest patrol is still another opening for the use of expert aviators. Every year, almost, our great forest fires in the northwest demonstrate that our present methods of prevention of forest fires are faulty; chiefly because the fires are not discovered while they are still smoldering. Constant airplane patrol over our great forests would make forest fires a thing of the past.  Then there are any number of commercial uses to which airplanes can be put. Instead of a cargo of bombs, a commercial airplane could carry a cargo of small package freight for which immediate delivery is necessary.  The use of the airplane for passenger carrying is now being developed. The huge Caproni and Handley-Page machines will be used for this purpose in the future. Thousands of persons will want to fly just for the novelty, and the possibility of accidents will be reduced to the minimum.  Again, there is the need for scientific research and improvement of the airplane, which will keep scores of men and machines busy for years.  It will not be necessary, of course, to maintain the numerous government training fields for aviators after the war, but some of the best of them should be retained. I do not believe it will be necessary to discharge a single pilot or observer from the army or to junk a single undamaged airplane after the war.   Henry Woodhouse, Governor of the Aero Club of America and a world-wide authority on aeronautics, made the following forecast:   Aircraft capable of lifting fifteen tons, with a speed of one hundred miles an hour, are now in actual production. The first of the American-built Caproni planes, equipped with four Liberty motors and developing 1,750 horse-power has just been successfully tested. This giant plane has a total lifting capacity of 40,000 pounds, or twenty tons. The super-Handley-Page or the Caproni could easily carry fifty bags, or more than a ton of mail. This means 100,000 letters. Judging the future development of aircraft by what has taken place in the last two years, we may look for the building of a 5,000-horse-power airplane, possibly within a year.  If the people of the various cities along the eight great air-ways already proposed insist on it, at least a dozen additional aerial mail lines can be established within twelve months. This can be done by utilizing only machines not needed by the army or navy. That means it will be possible to send by postplane at least 50,000,000 of the 100,000,000 day and night letters, and at least 25,000,000 of the 50,000,000 special delivery letters that are sent each year in the United States.  Postoffice officials estimate that the average cost of telegraphic day and night letters now going over the wires is close to one dollar each. Special delivery letters average about thirteen cents apiece.  This makes a total of more than fifty million dollars\\' worth of potential aerial mail business that is simply waiting for the establishment of aerial mail routes which can easily be established within the next twelve months.  Four hundred miles is the distance over which postplane day mail is most effective. Aerial mail letters are effective over any distance, since, with proper stations, light signals and guides for night postplane flying, the air mail can be carried more than one thousand miles between the hours of 6 P. M. and 8 A. M.  The cost of aerial mail night and day letters will be less than that of wire communication. The cost of an aerial mail letter is sixteen cents for two ounces. For this price there can be sent a message that would cost five dollars to send by telegraph.  The estimate of $50,000,000 of potential postplane business takes no account of the possibilities of transporting parcel post aerial mail. One of the Caproni 2,100-horse-power machines now in operation could easily transport 2,500 pounds of mail. At least $25,000,000 worth of parcel post could be sent by airplane.  Enthusiasts who look forward to the transatlantic transportation of aerial mail as certain to come within the next twelve-month assert that there is another twenty-five million dollars\\' worth of transatlantic mail waiting for an aerial mail service. They point out that Uncle Sam now pays eighty cents a pound to American steamships to carry transatlantic mail and that a charge of one dollar per letter across the Atlantic would be a paying proposition.

Note the forward gunner, the pilot, the rear   gunner and the window of the commodious cock-pit within which the   airmen could stand upright.   Charges of mismanagement and graft were investigated by the United States Senate and by the Department of Justice. Former Justice of the United States Supreme Court Charles E. Hughes was named by President Wilson to conduct the latter inquiry. Waste was found, due largely to the emergency nature of the contract. Justice Hughes recommended that Col. Edward Deeds, of the United States Signal Corps, be tried by court martial for his connection with certain contracts, and recommended that several other persons be tried in the United States courts. Justice Hughes and the Senate Investigation Committee gave their unqualified approval to the management of America\\'s aircraft production by John D. Ryan. Mr. Ryan resigned his charge as head of the Aircraft Production Board in November, 1918. His last public announcement was of the invention of an aerial telephone, by which the commander of a squadron standing on the ground could communicate with-aviators flying in battle formation.    CHAPTER XLIX  HEALTH AND HAPPINESS OF THE AMERICAN FORCES  Since the fateful day when Cain slew Abel, thereby setting a precedent for human warfare, no fighter has been so well protected from disease and discomfort of mind and body, so speedily cured of his wounds, as the American soldier and sailor during the World War.  The basis of this remarkable achievement was sanitary education preached first by competent physicians and sociologists; then by newspapers to the civilian population; and ultimately by the soldiers and sailors themselves, each man acting as an evangel of personal and community health and sanitation. In 1914, before war was declared, the words \"venereal diseases\" were relegated to the advertisements of quacks and patent medicines. When the war ended, virtually every young and old man and woman knew the meaning of the words and the miseries that come in their train. So it was with other details of the care of the human body, with sewage problems, with the grave community question of pure water, with the use of intoxicating beverages, and with other problems inter-woven with the health and happiness of humanity.  Among the leaders in this wide-flung campaign of education was the American Red Cross. Starting with a mere nominal membership before the war, its roster rose to the mighty total of more than 28,000,000 American men, women and children when the war ended. More than $300,000,000 was poured into the American Red Cross treasury. In addition to these contributions of money, came the free services of millions of Americans, mostly women. Red Cross workshops dotted the land, and from these came bandages, sweaters, comfort-kits, trench necessities, clothing for homeless refugees, and a vast quantity of material aid in every conceivable form. American Red Cross workers during the war knitted 14,089,000 garments for the army and navy. In addition, the workers turned out 253,196,000 surgical dressings, 22,255,000 hospital garments and 1,464,000 refugee garments.  Sewing chapters repaired old clothing and sent it overseas to the orphaned and the widowed, and millions of Americans learned the sublime lesson of sacrifice through the Red Cross--a lesson that left its imprint upon America for generations.  The work of the American Red Cross extended through many lands. It followed the flags of the Entente Allies into Palestine, Mesopotamia, India, South Africa, and other battle-grounds. Its work on the western front was a miracle of achievement. In Russia through the Red Terror of the Revolution the workers of the American Red Cross went serenely about their tasks of mercy, relieving the hungry, aiding the sick, and clothing the ragged peasants.  Henry P. Davidson left the firm of J. P. Morgan & Company to devote his administrative genius to the affairs of the American Red Cross. Other men and women of rare executive ability joined in the free tender of their services to the work of the Red Cross.  While the organization strove mightily against famines, wounds and disease overseas, it was suddenly confronted during the period from September 8th to November 9th, 1918, with the severest epidemic America had experienced in generations. Returning American troops brought the germs of the malady known as \"Spanish influenza\" into New York and Boston. Thence it spread throughout the country. During its brief career the epidemic claimed a total of 82,306 deaths in forty-six American cities, having a combined population of 23,000,000. Philadelphia, a great center of war industry, with the Philadelphia Navy Yard harboring thousands of sailors and marines, showed the highest mortality in proportion to population, 7.4 per 1,000; Baltimore with 6.7 per 1,000 showed the next greatest mortality.  The record of the Red Cross in this epidemic was one of instant service. Hundreds of thousands of masks were made in Red Cross workrooms, and these were worn by nurses and by members of families in afflicted homes.  On May 1, 1917, just before the appointment of the War Council, the American Red Cross had 486,194 members working through 562 chapters. On July 31, 1918, the organization numbered 20,648,103 annual members, besides 8,000,000 members of the Junior Red Cross--a total enrollment of over one-fourth the population of the United States. These members carried on their Red Cross work through 3,854 chapters, which again divided themselves into some 30,000 branches and auxiliaries.  The total actual collections from the first war fund amounted to more than $115,000,000. The subscriptions to the second war fund amounted to upward of $176,000,000. From membership dues the collections approximated $24,500,000.  The Home Service of the Red Cross with its more than 40,000 workers, extended its ministrations of sympathy and counsel each month to upward of 100,000 families left behind by soldiers at the front.  Supplementing, but not duplicating, the work of the American Red Cross, were the services of the Y. M. C. A., Y. W. C. A., Knights of Columbus, Jewish Welfare Association, Salvation Army, American Library Association and other bodies.  These operated under the general supervision of the War and Navy departments: Commissions on Training Camp Activities. Raymond B. Fosdick was the chairman of both these bodies. Concerning these commissions, President Wilson declared:   I do not believe it an exaggeration to say that no army ever before assembled has had more conscientious and painstaking thought given to the protection and stimulation of its mental, moral and physical manhood. Every endeavor has been made to surround the men, both here and abroad, with the kind of environment which a democracy owes to those who fight in its behalf. In this work the Commissions on Training Camp Activities have represented the government and the government\\'s solicitude that the moral and spiritual resources of the nation should be mobilized behind the troops. The country is to be congratulated upon the fine spirit with which organizations and groups of many kinds, some of them of national standing, have harnessed themselves together under the leadership of the government\\'s agency in a common ministry to the men of the army and navy.   Afloat and ashore the organizations operating under the supervision of the two commissions gave to the men of the American forces home care, suitable recreation, and constant protection. The club life of the army and navy, both in the training camps and after the men went into the service, was most capably directed by the Y. M. C. A., Knights of Columbus, and the Jewish Welfare Association. Non-sectarianism was the rule in all of the huts and clubs conducted by these organizations. Catholic, Protestant and Jewish chaplains mingled with workers of the Salvation Army, with professional prize-fighters who became athletic instructors, with actors and actresses who contributed their talents freely to the entertainment of soldiers and sailors. Moving-picture shows, boxing contests, continuation schools, canteens where women workers served American-made dishes--these were some of the activities following the men. The Y. M. C. A. and Knights of Columbus bore the largest share of this work. More than $300,000,000 was contributed by the people of America to the maintenance of these activities.  The other organizations rounded out the work of the first two organizations and filled in with special attention to needs on which the others did not specialize.  The larger organization, the Y. M. C. A., was chosen by the government to carry out a portion of the government program--the conducting of the canteens.  The Knights of Columbus specialized in comforts less considered by other war relief organizations.  Nothing gave greater relaxation to the fighting man, coming from the trenches, or the battle line caked with mud and blood and weary with long hours, than a shower bath, and generous facilities were provided close to the fighting front.  Back of the lines in the rest billets and concentration camps, provisions were less generous than at the front until the Knights of Columbus took up the task of seeing that the men who were temporarily away from the active fighting had these facilities for bathing. It was but one of the many activities of the Knights of Columbus, but one of the most appreciated.  One of the first requisitions made by Rev. John B. De Valles, one of the first chaplains sent over by the Knights of Columbus, was for a shower bath and he set it up in connection with his headquarters in a little French town and it was overworked from the first. From this spread the movement for establishing shower baths in club houses being opened behind the lines and in villages.  There was no preaching in a Knights of Columbus hall or club room, but there was clean moral environment and healthy recreation and amusement, for this was proven the thing to keep up the morale of fighting men.  The Y. M. C. A. built 1,500 huts in Europe costing from $2,000 to $20,000 each, equipped with canteen, reading and writing and recreational facilities to soldiers. It operated twenty-eight different leave areas with hotels that had a total of 35,000 beds. In addition, in Paris, port towns, and several big centers in the war zone there were \"Y\" hotels for transient soldiers where one could get a clean bed and a good meal at about half the price charged by French hotels. Over 3,000 movie and theatrical shows a week were provided free, and 300 \"Y\" athletic directors had charge of the sports in the American army, operating 836 athletic fields. Enormous quantities of cookies and chocolate and cigarettes were supplied.  A hundred of the best known educators from America directed educational work. The staff consisted of Professor Erskine of Columbia University, Professor Daly of Harvard, Professor Coleman of Chicago University, Professor Appleton of the University of Kansas and Frank Spaulding, superintendent of the Cleveland public schools.  Seconding the work of the Y. M. C. A., its sister organization, the Y. W. C. A., extended its activities from the training camps of America to the battle-fields of Europe.  At the close of its first year of America\\'s participation in the war, the Y. W. C. A. had six established lines of work in France:  Hostess Houses, clubs for French working women and business girls, clubs for nurses with the American army, clubs for women of the signal corps, clubs for British women (Waac\\'s) working with the American army, and recreation work for all women employed in any way by the American Expeditionary Force. In one year its activities spread to twenty-five cities, and it had forty-three units.  The Hostess Houses were at Paris and Tours. The Hotel Petrograd, on the Rue Caumartin, was leased in Paris and turned out to be one of the most interesting centers of American life in France. It was run on the most liberal lines, in a thoroughly democratic way. The meals were good and in the big dining-room men were admitted on the same footing as women. There were two of these Hostess Houses at Tours.  For the girls of the signal corps twenty-two homes were opened and there were huts for the Waacs at Bourges and Tours. Y. W. C. A. secretaries were attached to twenty base hospital units and opened fourteen clubs for nurses.  The most interesting and unique work of the Y. W. C. A. was that of its foyers for French working women and business girls. There were thirteen of these in Lyons, Rouen, Bourges, Tours, Ste. Etienne, Paris and Mont Lucon.  The Salvation Army erected hotels at the various large training camps in America, and its workers made American doughnuts for the soldiers close to the battle-lines in France. The work done by the men and women of the Salvation Army aided materially in bringing the heart of America into France.  The Jewish Welfare Association not only performed notable service in following the men from training camps into actual service, but it also planned and executed a great reconstruction program under the direction of Felix M. Warburg, chairman of the Joint Distribution Committee.  The American Library Association solved the grave problem of providing the soldiers and sailors with suitable reading matter. Each of the cantonments had its special library building in charge of a trained librarian, and interesting literature followed the men into the field through the services of this organization.  Some idea of the work of these various organizations is gained by reading the following order received by Raymond B. Fosdick at his headquarters in Washington after the steamship Kansas carrying supplies for the various huts at American field quarters, was sunk:   Send 20 tons plain soap, 20 tons condensed milk, 10 tons chocolate, 5 tons cocoa, 2 tons tea, 5 tons coffee, 5 tons vanilla wafers, 50 tons sugar, 20 tons flour, 2 tons fruit essences, 2 tons lemonade powder, 120,000 Testaments, 120,000 hymn-books, tons of magazines and other literature, 30 tons writing-paper and envelopes, 50,000 folding chairs, 500 camp cots, 2,000 blankets, 20 typewriters, 60 tents, 75 moving-picture machines, 200 phonographs, 5,000 records, 1 ton ink blotters, $75,000 worth athletic goods, 30 automobiles and trucks.   The order was filled at once.  Besides the associations above enumerated, other volunteer organizations contributed to the health and happiness of American soldiers and sailors. The Emergency Aid of Pennsylvania established two clubs, one in Paris, the other in Tours, both of which performed notable services in feeding and restoring the spirits of American soldiers and sailors. The club in Paris was under the direction of the Rev. Frederick W. Beekman, and that at Tours was directed by Amos Tuck French. Mrs. Barclay Warburton of Philadelphia was designated by Governor Brumbaugh as Commissioner-General of Overseas Work for the Emergency Aid. Other states had similar organizations looking after the comfort of the men.  But it was upon the professional doctors, nurses and sanitarians that the bulk of the task devolved. This task included the prevention as well as the cure of maladies menacing the American forces. It reached out into years after the war into the problems of re-education and re-habilitation of the shell-shocked and the wounded. Major-General William C. Gorgas, former Surgeon General of the Army, stated this concept when he said:  \"The whole conception of governmental and national responsibility for caring for the wounded has undergone radical change during the months of study given the subject by experts serving with the Medical Officers\\' Reserve Corps and others consulting with them. Instead of the old idea that responsibility ended with the return of the soldier to private life with his wounds healed and such pension as he might be given, it is now considered that it is the duty of the government to equip and re-educate the wounded man, after healing his wounds, and to return him to civil life ready to be as useful to himself and his country as possible.\"  To carry out this idea reconstruction hospitals were established in large centers of population. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, Buffalo, Cincinnati, Chicago, St. Paul, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Denver, Kansas City, St. Louis, Memphis, Richmond, Atlanta and New Orleans were sites of these institutions. Each was planned as a 500-bed hospital but with provision for enlargement to 1,000 beds if needed.  These hospitals were not the last step in the return of the wounded soldiers to civil life. When the soldiers were able to take up industrial training, further provision was ready.  Arrangements were made by the Department of Military Orthopedics to care for soldiers, so far as orthopedics (the prevention of deformity) was concerned, continuously until they were returned to civil life. Orthopedic surgeons were attached to the medical force near the firing line and to the different hospitals back to the base orthopedic hospital which was established within one hundred miles of the firing line. In this hospital, in addition to orthopedic surgical care, there was equipment for surgical reconstruction work and \"curative workshops\" in which men acquired ability to use injured members while doing work interesting and useful in itself. This method supplanted the old and tiresome one of prescribing a set of motions for a man to go through with no other purpose than to re-acquire use of his injured part.  Instructors and examiners for all the troops were furnished by the Department of Military Orthopedic Surgery. A number of older and more experienced surgeons acted as instructors and supervisors for each of the groups into which the army was divided.  A peculiar condition arising from the use of heavy artillery in the war was that called \"shell-shock.\"  The most pathetic wrecks of war were soldiers suffering from shattered nerves. Paris had many of them. They appeared to be normal. But they were human wrecks.  Shell-shock or the aftermath of illness from wounds left them in weakened health, subject to violent heart attacks. Most of them lacked energy and perseverance. They became awkward, like big children. If employment was found for them--for many had large families to support--they quickly lost their jobs through apathy or collapse.  A society in Paris did everything possible to relieve the sufferings of these victims of the war. It operated with the authorization of the French Government under the name \"L\\'Assistance aux Blesses Nerveux de la Guerre.\"  American hospitals after the war contained many of these cases. Some of the victims became incurably insane.  Besides the noble work done by the great army of American physicians, surgeons and nurses, in caring for soldiers and sailors, a service of scarcely less magnitude was rendered to the civilian populations of France, Belgium and Italy. Tuberculosis in France was a real plague, taking a toll of 80,000 lives every year. American physicians and nurses preached the doctrine of fresh air, care of the teeth and proper food for children. Almost immediately this campaign of sanitation had its effect in a decreasing death-rate from tuberculosis.  European nations generally were benefited by the stay of the American army overseas. The straightforward manner in which the social evil was attacked had direct benefits. The important detail of dental care also received an interest through the advent of the American soldier. The London Daily Mail made this comment on that question:  \"One thing about the American soldiers and sailors must strike English people when they see these gallant fighters, and that is the soundness and general whiteness of their teeth. From childhood the \\'Yank\\' is taught to take care of his teeth. He has \\'tooth drill\\' thrice daily and visits his dentist at fixed periods, say, every three or four months. If by chance a tooth does decay, the rot is at once arrested by gold or platinum filling. American dentists never extract a tooth. No matter how badly decayed it may be, they save the molar by crowning it with gold.  \"The United States soldiers have set us a splendid example in this matter. They fairly shame the ordinary \\'Tommy\\' by the brilliance of their molars, but they will do so no longer if young English mothers will only wake up to the fact that bad teeth cause bad health, and that doctors\\' and dentists\\' bills will be saved by the regular use of the tooth-brush.\"    CHAPTER L  THE PIRATES OF THE UNDER-SEAS  Germany relied upon the submarine to win the war. This in a nut-shell explains the main reason why the United States was drawn into the World War. Von Tirpitz, the German Admiral, obsessed with the theory that no effective answer could be made to the submarine, convinced the German High Command and the Kaiser that only through unrestricted submarine warfare could England be starved and the war brought to an end with victory for Germany. Since August, 1914, the theory held by von Tirpitz and his party of extremists had been combated by Prince Maximilian of Baden and by Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg and by others high in the council of the Kaiser. These men pointed out that, leaving out such questions as piracy on the high seas, the drowning of women and children, the destruction of the property of neutrals, there still remained the question of expediency. America, they asserted, was certain to enter the war if unrestricted submarine warfare was decreed. These men were denounced as cowards and von Tirpitz finally triumphed.  The submarine employed by the Germans was of the type designed by Simon Lake, an American. The Germans bought two submarines built by Mr. Lake at Kronstadt for the Russians during the Russian-Japanese war. Various improvements upon the Diesel engine and special training for submarine crews enabled the German navy to strike terrible blows during the early part of the war.  Little by little, however, the Allies discovered the answer to the submarine menace. One of these was the convoy: fleets of merchant vessels surrounded by fast destroyers made life a misery for the submarine crews. In the early days vessels of all character fled from the approach of the submarine. The destroyers of the convoys, however, adopted a different method. They rushed at the periscopes in efforts to ram the submarine, and as they raced over the spot where the submarine had been at the rate of twenty-two knots or more an hour, they dropped huge containers, dubbed \"ash cans\", containing depth charges of trinitrotoluol.  Sea planes carrying bombs, small dirigible balloons known as \"blimps,\" observation balloons moored on the decks of warships, steel nets, and especially devised anti-submarine mines, were also factors in the general work of submarine destruction.  In addition to all these, every ship, both cargo carrier and war vessel, had its well-trained gun crew, and hundreds of thousands of keen-eyed mariners daily and nightly swept the seas with binoculars watching for anything that resembled a periscope.  As a consequence of this combination of destructive agencies the British Admiralty was enabled to announce at the close of the war that more than 150 German submarines had been destroyed.  The names of the commanding officers of the German submarines which had been disposed of were given out by the government in order to substantiate to the world the statement made by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons on August 7th, and denied in the German papers, that \"at least 150 of these ocean pests had been destroyed.\" The statement included no officers commanding the Austrian submarines, of which a number had been destroyed, and did not exhaust the list of German submarines put out of action.  The fate of the officers was given, and of these the majority (116) were dead; twenty-seven were prisoners of war, six were interned in neutral countries where they took refuge, and one succeeded in returning to Germany.  Further light on the subject of German submarines was given on September 18, 1918, by Senator William H. Thompson of Kansas in a speech in which he told the Senate:   The submarine is no longer a serious menace to transportation across the seas. It is, of course, an annoyance and a great hindrance, and as long as there is a single submarine in the waters of the sea every effort must be made by the allied powers to destroy it, for it is an outlaw and must not exist. The truth is that Germany never had more than 320 submarines all told, including all construction before and since the war.  We have positive knowledge of the destruction of more than one-half of these submarines, and we also know that it is practically impossible for Germany to keep in operation more than 10 per cent of those remaining. It is therefore reduced to a negligible quantity so far as its ultimate effect upon the result of the war is concerned.  1 saw a reliable statement in France to the effect that there is one ship of some character leaving the eastern shores of America for the war zone every six minutes, and it is only a few vessels which are ever torpedoed, estimated at about one per cent. This is less than the loss by storm and accident in the earlier days of transportation and is not much greater than such loss now. We must bear in mind that we read only of the ships which have been torpedoed and see but little account of the hundreds of ships which pass over the ocean safely and undisturbed. Three hundred thousand soldiers are conveyed across the Atlantic every thirty days, and an average of about 500,000 tons of freight carried to the French coast. There are warehouses in only one of the many ports of France with a capacity of over 2,000,000 tons.  It is to the navy that the credit for the destruction of this outlaw seagoing craft is due. The navy is and has been the backbone of this war, the same as it has been of almost every great war in history. Without the allied navy the submarine would have perhaps accomplished its nefarious purpose in starving the European allies and in preventing them from securing the necessary munitions of war to defend themselves. It has utterly failed in this respect. The Allies are amply supplied with food, and there are provisions enough on hand now, if every ship should be sunk, to last the Allies and armies for months. The destroyer is the ship which has brought Germany to her knees in submarine warfare and will keep her there. We have not enough destroyers, and it is for this reason we are obliged in this great transportation problem to run risks which would not be taken under ordinary conditions. If every ship was escorted by a sufficient number of destroyers I doubt if there would be a single ship of any consequence sunk, except by the merest accident.   Upon the same subject, Sir Eric Geddes, First Lord of the British Admiralty, on October 14th, reviewing the British effort in the war said that during 1918 the casualties of the British on the western front equaled those of all the Allies combined. The British navy, he said, since the beginning of the war had lost in fighting ships of all classes a total of 230, more than twice the losses in war vessels of all the Allies.  In addition to these, Great Britain had lost 450 auxiliary craft, such as mine-sweepers and trawlers, making a total of 680. He revealed the fact that the effective warship barrage, which had been drawn between the Orkneys and Norway against German submarines and surface craft, was, during the later months of the war, maintained largely by ships of the United States.  The British merchant ships lost since 1914 exceeded 2,400, representing a gross tonnage of 7,750,000, nearly three times the aggregate loss of all other allied and neutral countries.  In his statement on the submarine situation he said:   In February, 1917, the ruthless submarine warfare confronted us, whilst the armies in France at that time were feeling a sense of superiority over the enemy which was illustrated by the successes of the battle of Arras, the taking of Vimy Ridge, the advance between the Ancre and the Somme, the offensive in Champagne, Chemin des Dames, Messines and Passchendaele Ridges. Thus we felt, and rightly felt, that the weakest front at that time was the sea--not on the surface, but under water.  The whole of the available energies of the Allies were consequently thrown into overcoming the submarine and the menace which threatened to destroy the lines of communication of the Alliance. The reduced sinkings which have been published since that period show how we gradually overcame that menace--and today most men say that the submarine menace is a thing of the past.  That it is a thing of the past in so far as it can never win the war for the enemy or enable the enemy to prevent us from winning the war, provided we do not underrate the danger but take adequate steps against it, I affirm now as the opinion of the British Admiralty; but it is a menace that comes and goes.   The end of the great submarine menace came on November 20th, when twenty German submarines were officially surrendered to Rear-Admiral Tyrwhitt of the British Navy, thirty miles off Harwich, England. Within the following week more than eighty other German submarines and a number of Austrian craft were also surrendered to the British. The spectacle of the surrender was most impressive.  After steaming some twenty miles across the North Sea, the Harwich forces, which consisted of five light cruisers and twenty destroyers, were sighted. The flagship of Admiral Tyrwhitt, the commander, was the Curacao. High above about the squadron hung a big observation balloon.  The squadron, headed by the flagship, then steamed toward the Dutch coast, followed by the Coventry, Dragoon, Danal and Centaur. Other ships followed in line with their navigation lights showing. The picture was a noble one as the great vessels, with the moon still shining, plowed their way to take part in the surrender of the German U-boats.  Soon after the British squadron started the \"paravanes\" were dropped overboard. These devices are shaped like tops and divert any mines which may be encountered, for the vessels were now entering a mine field.  Almost everyone on board donned a life belt and just as the red sun appeared above the horizon the first German submarine appeared in sight.  Soon after seven o\\'clock twenty submarines were seen in line, accompanied by two German destroyers, the Tibania and the Sierra Ventana, which were to take the submarine crews back to Germany after the transfer.  All the submarines were on the surface with their hatches open and their crews standing on deck. The vessels were flying no flags whatever and their guns were trained fore and aft, in accordance with the terms of surrender.  A bugle sounded on the Curacao and all the gun crews took up their stations, ready for any possible treachery.  The leading destroyer, in response to a signal from the admiral, turned and led the way towards England and the submarines were ordered to follow. They immediately did so. The surrender had been accomplished.  Each cruiser turned, and, keeping a careful lookout, steamed toward Harwich. On the deck of one of the largest of the submarines, which carried two 5.9 guns, twenty-three officers and men were counted. The craft was estimated to be nearly 300 feet in length. Its number had been painted out.  Near the Ship Wash lightship three large British seaplanes, followed by an airship, were observed. One of the submarines was seen to send up a couple of carrier pigeons and at once a signal was flashed from the admiral that it had no right to do this.  When the ships had cleared the mine field and entered the war channel the \"paravanes\" were hauled aboard. On reaching a point some twenty miles off Harwich the ships dropped anchor and Captain Addison went out on the warship Maidstone.  British crews were then put on board the submarines to take them into harbor. With the exception of the engine staffs all the German sailors remained on deck. The submarines were then taken through the gates of the harbor and the German crews were transferred to the transports and taken back to Germany.  As the boats went through the gates a white signal was run up on each of them with the German flag underneath.  Each German submarine commander at the transfer was required to sign a declaration to the effect that his vessel was in running order, that its periscope was intact, that its torpedoes were unloaded and that its torpedo heads were safe.  Orders had been issued forbidding any demonstration and these instructions were obeyed to the letter. There was complete silence as the submarines surrendered and as the crews were transferred.  On November 21st, the German High Seas fleet that had been protected by the submarines surrendered to the combined fleet consisting of British, American and French battleships. The British admiralty\\'s terse statement concerning the historic spectacle follows:   The commander-in-chief of the Grand Fleet has reported that at 9.30 o\\'clock this morning he met the first and main installment of the German high seas fleet, which is surrendering for internment. Admiral Sir David Beatty is Commander-in-chief of the Grand Fleet.   On the same day another flotilla of German U-boats also was surrendered to a British squadron. There were nineteen submarines in all; the twentieth broke down on the way.  The Grand Fleet, accompanied by five American battleships and three French cruisers, steamed out at 3 o\\'clock on the morning of November 21st, from its Scottish base to accept the surrender. The vessels moved in two long columns.  The German fleet which surrendered consisted of nine battleships, five cruisers, seven light cruisers and fifty destroyers, Seventy-one vessels in all. There remained to be surrendered two battleships, which were under repair, and fifty modern torpedo-boat destroyers.  One German destroyer while on its way across the North Sea with the other ships of the German High Seas fleet to surrender struck a mine. It was so badly damaged that it sank.  Describing the surrender of the German warships to Sir David Beatty, the Commander-in-Chief of the grand fleet, correspondents said that after all the German ships had been taken over, the British admiral went through the line on the Queen Elizabeth, every Allied vessel being manned and greeting the admiral and the flagship with loud and ringing cheers.

THE EYE OF THE SUBMARINE   Diagram of a periscope, showing how, when its tip is lifted out of   water, a picture of the sea\\'s surface is reflected downward from a   prism, through lenses, and then a lower prism, hence to the officer\\'s   eye. It turns in any direction.   The British grand fleet put to sea in two single lines six miles apart, and so formed as to enable the surrendering fleet to come up the center. The leading ship of the German line was sighted between 9 and 10 o\\'clock in the morning. It was the Seydlitz, flying the German naval ensign.  A telegram received in Amsterdam from Berlin gave this list of surrendered warships, which includes one more battleship than later reports showed:  Battleships--Kaiser, 24,113 tons; Kaiserin, 24,113 tons; Koenig Albert, 24,113 tons; Kronprinz Wilhelm, 25,000 tons; Prinzregent Luitpold, 24,113 tons; Markgraf, 25,293 tons; Grosser Kurfuerst, 25,293 tons; Bayern, 28,000 tons; Koenig, 25,293 tons, and Friedrich der Grosse, 24,113.  Battle Cruisers--Hindenburg, 27,000 tons; Derflinger, 28,000 tons; Seydlitz, 25,000 tons; Moltke, 23,000 tons, and Van Der Tann, 18,800 tons.  Light Cruisers--Bremen, 4,000 tons; Brummer, 4,000 tons; Frankfurt, 5,400 tons; Koeln, tonnage uncertain; Dresden, tonnage uncertain, and Emden, 5,400 tons.    CHAPTER LI  APPROACHING THE FINAL STAGE  The might and pride of Germany were smashed and humbled by Foch in frontal attacks divided roughly into three great sectors. The first of these attacks was delivered by the French and Americans in the southern sector which included Verdun and the Argonne. The second smash was delivered by British, French and Americans in the Cambrai sector. The third was delivered by British, Belgians, French and Americans in the Belgian sector on the north of the great battle line.  The Cambrai operation had as its first objectives the possession of the strategic railways both of which ran from Valenciennes, one to the huge distribution center at Douai; the other to Cambrai itself. To reach these objectives the Allies were obliged to cross the Sensee and the Escaut canals under infantry and artillery fire. Besides these natural obstacles, there was the famous Hunding line of fortifications erected by the Germans between the Scarpe and the Oise River.  The attack was opened in force on September 18, 1918, by the Fourth British army under General Rawlinson and the First French army under General Debeney. The assault was successful northwest of St. Quentin and determined German counter-attacks were broken down by French and British artillery fire.  The Third British army under General Byng and the Thirtieth American division co-operating with the First British army under Sir Henry Horne, attacked furiously over a fourteen-mile front toward Cambrai. The net result of this operation was the possession of the Canal du Nord, the taking of several villages, and 6,000 prisoners. This was on September 27th. The following day the same forces captured Fontaine-Notre Dame, Marcoing, Noyelles, and Cantaing. More than 200 guns were captured and 10,000 prisoners. On September 29th the Americans took Bellecourt and Nauroy, and invested the suburbs of Cambrai. The British crossed the Escaut canal and the Canadians penetrated some of the environs of Cambrai.  The resolution and ferocity of the attack thoroughly dismayed the Germans, and the salient produced by the smash forced the Teutons to evacuate the greatly prized Lens coal fields on October 3d. Horne and Byng continued their advance, the former occupying Biache-St. Vaast southwest of Douai, and the latter reaching a position five miles northwest of Cambrai.  Caught between the jaws of the pincers, the German forces occupying Cambrai made haste to escape outright capture. The city that had been the objective of British hopes and thrusts for two years, fell into the hands of the Allies. The German retreat extended over a thirty-mile front and included both St. Quentin and Cambrai. Simultaneously the German forces between Arras and St. Quentin fell steadily backward. Le Cateau and Zazeuel fell into the hands of the British October 17th, three thousand prisoners and a quantity of war material being included in the bag.  In the meantime General Mangin attacking in the Laon sector, drove the Germans from the strategic Chemin des Dames and with General Berthelot captured Berry-au-Bac, the St. Gobain massif and completed contact with Generals Pershing and Gouraud on the right and with Generals Rawlinson and Debeney on the left.  The Allied advance now became a huge steel broom, sweeping the Germans irresistibly before it. The operation extended from the Oise southeast to the Aisne, broadening thence until it included the entire front. The Hindenburg line, the Somme battle-field, the Hunding line, were all quickly overrun. The fortress of Maubeuge, fifty miles northeast of St. Quentin, which was connected with that city by a triple railway connection, was evacuated as a direct result of this operation.  When St. Quentin itself fell into the hands of Debeney, it was found that the Germans had deported the entire civilian population of 50,000.  This was the crux of the operations by Foch. Germans were given no rest; night and day the pressure continued. Every clash showed the increasing superiority of the Allies both in men and material and the corresponding deterioration of the German forces. This demoralization of the Germans extended from the High Command to the private soldier.  Prisoners poured into the hands of  the Allies. Evacuation of Lille was commenced on October 2d and Roubaix and Turcoing also fell.  It was the beginning of Germany\\'s military debacle. The time was ripe for the coup-de-grace soon to be delivered by Americans co-operating with the Allies on a seventy-one mile front.  The Kaiser, Ludendorf and von Hindenburg abandoned hope. The command went forth from the German general headquarters to retreat, retreat, retreat, while Prince Maximilian of Baden appealed to America for an armistice. The sword in Germany\\'s hand was broken. Autocracy, defeated in the eyes of its deluded subjects and discredited in the eyes of the world, was in headlong flight. Its only concern was to save as much as possible from the ruins of the ostentatious temple it had reared.    CHAPTER LII  LAST DAYS OF THE WAR  From November 1st until November 11th, the day when the armistice granting terms to Germany was signed, the collapse of the German defensive was complete. The army that under von Hindenburg and Ludendorf had smashed its way over Poland, Roumania, Serbia, Belgium, and into the heart of France, was now a military machine in full retreat. It is only justice to that machine to say that the great retreat at no place degenerated into a rout. Von Hindenburg and the German General Staff had planned a series of rear-guard actions that were effective in protecting the main bodies of infantry and artillery. Machine-gun nests and airplane attacks were the main reliance of the Germans in these maneuvers of delay, but the German field artillery also did its share.  Immense quantities of material and many thousands of prisoners were captured by the British, Canadians and Australians in the north, and by the French and Americans in the south. Simultaneously with this wide and savage drive upon the Germans along the Belgian and French fronts, came the heaviest Italian attack of the war. Before it the Austrians were swept in a torrent that was irresistible. French, English and American troops co-operated in this thrust that extended from the plains of the Piave into Trentino. The immediate effect of the Italian offensive was to force Austria to her knees in abject surrender. An armistice, humiliating in its terms, was signed by the Austrian representatives, and the back door to Germany was opened to the Allies.  Germany\\'s frantic plea for an armistice followed. There were those in the Allied countries who maintained that nothing short of unconditional surrender should be permitted. Cooler counsel prevailed, and an armistice was offered to the German High Command through General Foch, the terms of which far exceeded in severity those granted to Turkey and Austria. These were read for the first time by Germany\\'s representatives on Friday, November 8th. General Foch, when he gave the document to the German delegation, declared that Germany\\'s decision must be made within seventy-two hours. Eleven o\\'clock on Monday, November 11th, was the time limit permitted to Germany. The armistice was signed by General Foch and the German representatives on the morning of November 11th, but fighting did not actually cease until eleven o\\'clock, several hours after the terms had been agreed to. This was in accordance with arrangement made between the signers.  Sedan, where Marshals McMahon and Bazaine, commanding the armies of Napoleon III, surrendered to the King of Prussia in 1870, marked the last notable victory of the American forces in France. The Sedan of 1870 marked the birth of German militarism. The Sedan of 1918 marked its death.  Preceding the advance of the Americans upon Sedan, came a cloud of aviators in pursuit and bombing planes, headed by the famous aces of the American forces. The First and Second divisions of the First army led the way. In the van of the Second division were the Marines, whose heroism in Belleau Wood marked the beginning of Germany\\'s end. The famous Rainbow division made the most savage thrust of the action, pursuing the foe for ten miles and sweeping the Freya Hills clear of machine nests and German artillery.  The last action of the war for the Americans followed immediately on the heels of the battle of Sedan. It was the taking of the town of Stenay. The engagement was deliberately planned by the Americans as a sort of battle celebration of the end of the war. The order fixing eleven o\\'clock as the time for the conclusion of hostilities, had been sent from end to end of the American lines. Its text follows:   1. You are informed that hostilities will cease along the whole front at 11 o\\'clock A. M., November 11, 1918, Paris time.  2. No Allied troops will pass the line reached by them at that hour in date until further orders.  3. Division commanders will immediately sketch the location of their line. This sketch will be returned to headquarters by the courier bearing these orders.  4. All communication with the enemy, both before and after the termination of hostilities, is absolutely forbidden. In case of violation of this order severest disciplinary measures will be immediately taken. Any officer offending will be sent to headquarters under guard.  5. Every emphasis will be laid on the fact that the arrangement is an armistice only and not a peace.  6. There must not be the slightest relaxation of vigilance. Troops must be prepared at any moment for further operations.  7. Special steps will be taken by all commanders to insure strictest discipline and that all troops be held in readiness fully prepared for any eventuality.  8. Division and brigade commanders will personally communicate these orders to all organizations.   Signal corps wires, telephones and runners were used in carrying the orders and so well did the big machine work that even patrol commanders had received the orders well in advance of the hour. Apparently the Germans also had been equally diligent in getting the orders to the front line. Notwithstanding the hard fighting they did Sunday to hold back the Americans, the Germans were able to bring the firing to an abrupt end at the scheduled hour.  The staff and field officers of the American army were disposed early in the day to approach the hour of eleven with lessened activity. The day began with less firing and doubtless the fighting would have ended according to plan, had there not been a sharp resumption on the part of German batteries. The Americans looked upon this as wantonly useless. It was then that orders were sent to the battery commanders for increased fire.  Although there was no reason for it, German ruthlessness was still rampant Sunday, stirring the American artillery in the region of Dun-sur-Meuse and Mouzay to greater activity. Six hundred aged men and women and children were in Mouzay when the Germans attacked it with gas. There was only a small detachment of American troops there and the town no longer was of strategical value. However, it was made the direct target of shells filled with phosgene. Every street reeked with gas.  Poorly clad and showing plainly evidences of malnutrition, the inhabitants crowded about the Americans, kissing their hands and hailing them as deliverers. They declared they had had no meat for six weeks. They virtually had been prisoners of war for four years and were overwhelmed with joy when they learned that an armistice was probable.  The last French town to fall into American hands before the armistice went into effect was Stenay. Patrols reported they had found it empty not more than a quarter of an hour before eleven o\\'clock. American troops rushed through the town and in a few minutes Allied flags were beginning to appear from the windows. As the church bell solemnly tolled the hour of eleven, troops from the Ninetieth division were pouring into the town.  The inhabitants told the usual stories of German treatment. They were forced to work at all sorts of tasks from seven in the morning until six at night. In return they received paper bills with which they were unable to purchase milk and similar necessities. The majority, however, were so overjoyed at their deliverance that they were almost incoherent in discussing the enemy occupation.  The inhabitants of Stenay remained hiding in their cellars even after the Americans had entered the town. They came out hesitatingly and in small groups.  Hostilities along the American front ended with a crash of cannon.  The early forenoon had been marked by a falling off in fire all along the line, but an increasing bombardment from the retreating Germans at certain points stimulated the Americans to a quick retort. From their positions north of Stenay to southeast of the town the Americans began to bombard fixed targets. The firing reached a volume at times almost equivalent to a barrage.  Two minutes before eleven o\\'clock the firing dwindled, the last shells shrieking over No Man\\'s Land precisely on time.  There was little celebration on the front line, where American routine was scarcely disturbed over the cessation of fighting. In the areas behind the battle zone there were celebrations on all sides. Here and there there were little outbursts of cheering, but even those instances were not on the immediate front.  Many of the French soldiers went about singing.  \"Well, I don\\'t know,\" drawled a lieutenant from Texas while the artillery was sending its last challenge to the Germans, \"but somehow I can\\'t help wondering if we have licked them enough.\"  The Germans were manifestly so glad over the cessation of hostilities that they could not conceal their pleasure. Prisoners taken at Stenay grinned with satisfaction. Their demeanor was in sharp contrast to that of the American doughboys who took the matter philosophically and went about their appointed tasks.  In the front line it was the same. The Americans were happy, but quiet. They made no demonstrations. The Germans, on the other hand, were in a regular hysteria of joy. They waited only until nightfall to set off every rocket in their possession. In the evening the sky was ablaze with red, green, blue and yellow flares all along the line.  Flags appeared like magic over the shell-torn buildings of Verdun, French and American colors flying side by side.  In every village, even those from which the Germans had been driven, there were flags and decorations which were brought up to the front by the soldiers. In the villages back of the line there were impromptu celebrations and the civilians in holiday spirit saluted the Americans, shouting \"the war is finished.\"  Northeast of Verdun, just before 11 o\\'clock, American artillery-men in loading a six-inch howitzer, wrote \"good-luck\" on a ninety-pound shell and \"let \\'er go.\" The shot was aimed at the crossroad at Ornas, just ahead of the American lines.  While the bells of the ancient Verdun Cathedral were ringing the news of peace the fortress city was illuminated and a military procession headed by the drum corps of the Twenty-sixth American division swung along the crowded streets accompanied by a French detachment of buglers representing the famed defenders of Verdun.  Only a half hour before the Germans had thrown large shells within the city walls, apparently as a reminder that Verdun was still within the range of their guns to the hills to the northeast.  Monday afternoon and night virtually was the first time that Verdun had not been shelled in many hours almost since the war began.    CHAPTER LIII  THE DRASTIC TERMS OF SURRENDER  The end of the war came with almost the dramatic suddenness of its beginning. Bulgaria, hemmed in by armies through which no relief could penetrate, asked for terms. The reply came in two words, \"Unconditional Surrender.\"  Turkey, witnessing the rout of her army in Palestine by the great strategist, General Allenby, and a British army, asked for an armistice. The Porte signed without hesitation an agreement comprising twenty-five severe requirements.  The surrender of Bulgaria and Turkey forced Austria\\'s hand. The terms under which it was permitted to capitulate were even harder than those granted to Turkey. They comprised eighteen requirements divided into military and naval clauses.  Germany, proud, imperial Germany, met the greatest humiliation of all the Teutonic allies when the Kaiser and the German High Command were brought to their knees. Thirty-five clauses, the most severe and drastic ever demanded from a great power, were included in the armistice agreement. Only the imminent menace of an invasion of Germany would have sufficed to compel the German representatives to sign such a document. Following are the drafts of the Turkish, Austrian and German armistice agreements.   THE TURKISH AGREEMENT  1. The opening of the Dardanelles and the Bosporus and access to the Black Sea. Allied occupation of the Dardanelles and Bosporus forts.  2.

All the conditions of the article shall be carried into effect within fourteen days. Submarines ready for sea shall be prepared to leave German ports immediately upon orders by wireless, and the remainder at the earliest possible moment.  23. The following German surface warships which shall be designated by the Allies and the United States of America shall forthwith be disarmed and thereafter interned in neutral ports, to be designated by the Allies and the United States of America and placed under the surveillance of the Allies and the United States of America, only caretakers being left on board, namely:  Six battle cruisers, ten battleships, eight light cruisers, including two mine layers, fifty destroyers of the most modern type. All other surface warships (including river craft) are to be concentrated in naval bases to be designated by the Allies and the United States of America, and are to be paid off and completely disarmed and placed under the supervision of the Allies and the United States of America. All vessels of the auxiliary fleet (trawlers, motor vessels, etc.) are to [be] disarmed. Vessels designated for internment, shall be ready to leave German ports within seven days upon directions by wireless, and the military armament of all vessels of the auxiliary fleet shall be put on shore.  24. The Allies and the United States of America shall have the right to sweep all mine fields and obstructions laid by Germany outside German territorial waters, and the positions of these are to be indicated.  25. Freedom of access to and from the Baltic to be given to the naval and mercantile marine of the Allied and associated Powers. To secure this Allies and the United States of America shall be empowered to occupy all German forts, fortifications, batteries and defense works of all kinds in all the entrances from the Cattegat into the Baltic, and to sweep up all mines and obstructions within and without German territorial waters without any question of neutrality being raised, and the positions of all such mines and obstructions are to be indicated.  26. The existing blockade conditions set up by the Allies and associated Powers are to remain unchanged and all German merchant ships found at sea are to remain liable to capture. The Allies and the United States shall give consideration to the provisioning of Germany during the armistice to the extent recognized as necessary.  27. All naval aircraft are to be concentrated and immobilized in German bases to be specified by the Allies and the United States.  28. In evacuating the Belgian coasts and ports, Germany shall abandon all merchant ships, tugs, lighters, cranes and all other harbor materials, all materials for inland navigation, all aircraft and all materials and stores, all arms and armaments, and all stores and apparatus of all kinds.  29. All Black Sea ports are to be evacuated by Germany, all Russian war vessels of all descriptions seized by Germany in the Black Sea are to be handed over to the Allies and the United States of America; all neutral merchant vessels seized are to be released; all warlike and other materials of all kinds seized in those parts are to be returned and German materials as specified in clause twenty-eight are to be abandoned.  30. All merchant vessels in German hands belonging to the Allied and associated Powers are to be restored in ports to be specified by the Allies and the United States of America without reciprocity.  31. No destruction of ships or materials to be permitted before evacuation, surrender or restoration.  32. The German Government will notify neutral governments of the world, and particularly the governments of Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Holland, that all restrictions placed on the trading of their vessels with the Allied and associated countries, whether by the German Government or by private German interests, and whether in return for specific concessions such as the export of shipbuilding materials or not, are immediately canceled.  33. No transfers of German merchant shipping of any description to any neutral flag are to take place after signature of the armistice.  34. The duration of the armistice is to be thirty days, with option to extend. During this period, on failure of execution of any of the above clauses, the armistice may be denounced by one of the contracting parties on forty-eight hours\\' previous notice. It is understood that the execution of Articles 3 and 18 shall not warrant the denunciation of the armistice on the ground of insufficient execution within a period fixed, except in the case of bad faith in carrying them into execution. In order to assume the execution of this convention under the best conditions, the principle of a Permanent International Armistice Commission is admitted. This commission shall act under authority of the Allied military and naval commanders-in-chief.  35. This armistice to be accepted or refused by Germany within seventy-two hours of notification.    CHAPTER LIV  PEACE AT LAST  War came upon the world in August, 1914, with a suddenness and an impact that dazed the world. When it seemed, in 1918, that mankind had habituated himself to war and that the bloody struggle would continue until the actual exhaustion and extinction of the nations involved, peace suddenly appeared. The debacle of the Teutonic alliance was both dramatic and unexpected, except to those who knew how desperate were the conditions in the nations that were battling for autocracy. Bulgaria was first to crumble, then Turkey fell, and Austria-Hungary deserted Germany. The Kaiser and his military advisers, left alone, appealed to the Allies through President Wilson, for an armistice during which peace terms might be negotiated. Prince Maximilian of Baden, a statesman whose liberal ideas were rumored rather than demonstrated, was chosen to open negotiations. President Wilson, acting in concert with the Allies, referred Prince Maximilian to Marshal Foch.  While negotiations were pending, a cabled message was received on November 7th to the effect that the armistice had been signed and that all soldiers would cease fighting on two o\\'clock of that afternoon. It was a false report, but it spread with incredible speed throughout the country. Celebrations which included virtually every American, made the country a gala place for twenty-four hours. The American people with characteristic good nature laughed at the hoax next day and settled down in patience to await the inevitable declaration of an armistice.  The true report arrived about three o\\'clock, Eastern time, in the morning of November 11th. Shrieks of whistles, the booming of cannon, and the clangor of bells, awoke millions of sleeping persons, many of whom trooped into the streets to mingle their rejoicings with those of their neighbors. For a day there was high carnival in town and country throughout the land, then the nation settled down to face the imminent problems of reconstruction.  One of these had to do with the immediate reduction of governmental expenditures during the approaching year. President Wilson had appealed to the voters to elect a Democratic Congress as an evidence of approval for his administration. The reply was a Republican House of Representatives and a Republican Senate.  The Congress that had been in continuous session since America entered the war, ended its labors in mid-November.  For length, bulk of appropriations for the war and the number and importance of legislative measures passed, the session was unprecedented.  Appropriations passed aggregated $36,298,000,000, making the total for this Congress more than $45,000,000,000, of which $19,412,000,000 was appropriated at the first (an extra) session, at which war was declared on Germany.  Legislation passed included bills authorizing billions of Liberty bonds; creation of the War Finance Corporation; government control of telegraphs, telephones and cables; executive reorganization of government agencies, and extensions of the espionage act and the army draft law by which men between eighteen and forty-five years of age were required to register.  Prohibition and woman suffrage furnished sharp controversies throughout the session. The war-time \"dry\" measure was completed, but after the woman suffrage constitutional amendment resolution had been adopted, January 10th, by the House, it was defeated in the Senate by two votes.  Every man, woman and child in the belligerent nations owed almost seven times as much money when peace came as he did at the beginning of the war.  Figures of the war\\'s cost to the world compiled by the Federal Reserve Board were summarized in the statement that the approximate public debt per capita had increased from $60 before the war to almost $400 at the end of July, 1918. To this was added the cost since July, which is at the highest rate of the entire period.  The direct cost of the war was calculated by the board at somewhere between $170,000,000,000 and $180,000,000,000, not taking into account the authorization of the debt or the cost of indemnities.  Four-fifths of the huge burden fell upon the shoulders of the future, only Great Britain and America absorbing a considerable amount by taxation.  The total debt of the seven principal belligerents before the war did not exceed $25,000,000,000.  The board contrasted these figures with the total value of the gold and silver extracted from the earth since the beginning of the world, which, it said, hardly exceeded $30,000,000,000.  The belligerent nations, therefore, owed about six times the amount of all the gold and silver produced in all time.  Prices rose to three times the average of what they were at the beginning of the war.  Great Britain\\'s debt increased almost ten times over in the period of the war, or from $3,580,000,000 to $32,450,000,000 down to June, 1918. These figures do not include the debts of Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa, British colonies.  France\\'s debt was quadrupled by the beginning of 1918, increasing from $6,833,000,000 to $25,410,000,000.  Italy\\'s debt rose from $2,929,000,000 to $6,918,000,000.  Figures for Russia were brought up only to September, 1917, but they showed that at that time she owed $26,287,000,000, as compared with $5,234,000,000 at the beginning of the war.  The public debt of the United States was calculated to January 1, 1918, in order to be in line with those of other countries, increasing by that date to over $8,000,000,000 from a pre-war figure of a billion and a quarter. Since that time $11,500,000,000 have been subscribed to the Liberty Loans, thus increasing the national debt about sixteen fold.  The most extraordinary increase of all was that of Germany, rising from $1,208,000,000 to $26,332,000,000.  Austria owed $2,736,000,000 at the beginning of the war, which was increased by June, 1917, to $11,573,000,000.  Hungary increased her debt from $1,392,000,000 to $5,910,000,000 by December, 1917.  The neutrals, Denmark, Spain, Holland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland together owed $2,871,000,000 when war began and increased their debts only to $3,710,000,000.  Existing war obligations of the United States at the close of 1918 matured as follows:  First Liberty Loan, $2,000,000,000, redeemable at the option of the Treasury after 1932 and payable not later than 1947; Second Liberty Loan, $3,808,000,000, redeemable after 1927, payable in 1942; Third Liberty Loan, $4,176,000,000, redeemable and payable without option in 1928; Fourth Liberty Loan, $6,989,047,000, redeemable after 1933, payable in 1938; War Savings, $879,300,000 up to November, 1918, payable in 1923.  With this program of maturity, the Treasury by exercising its option could call in the nation\\'s war debt for redemption in installments every five years until 1947.  Secretary of the Treasury, William Gibbs McAdoo, who was also Director General of Transportation, created a sensation when he resigned both offices in November, 1918, the resignation to take effect January 1, 1919. Coming upon the eve of the peace conference in Paris and the announcement that President Wilson intended to head the American delegates to the conference, the resignation caused widespread surprise. The reasons given by Mr. McAdoo were ill-health and a serious depreciation of his private fortune during his incumbency of governmental positions.  Following the armistice, steps were immediately taken for the repatriation of a considerable portion of the American forces in France and the return to their homes of the men in American training camps. The Third Army of the United States, commanded by General Dickman, was ordered to the western shore of the Rhine, there to co-operate with the troops of the Allies until the conclusion of peace negotiations.  The country was amazed on November 23d when General March announced that the casualties of the American forces which had been anticipated as being less than 100,000, had in reality exceeded 236,000. Explanation for this lay in the fierce on-rush of the American forces during the last month of the war.  A forecast that many thousands of American boys would remain in France was given by Andre Tardieu, General Commissioner for Franco-American affairs, when addressing the Association of Foreign Correspondents in New York City, after the armistice had been signed.  M. Tardieu appealed for permission to retain American soldiers in France. He said:  \"We want first an immediate assistance in the matter of labor. We hope that, during the preparation and the carrying out of the transportation of your troops back to America your technical units as well as other units with their equipment will be able to co-operate in that effort. We soon will have to carry out a colossal work of transportation in view of the supplying of the regions evacuated by the enemy, of the recovering of the railroads in Northern and Eastern France and in Alsace-Lorraine. We will have to clean the reconquered ground of the ruins accumulated by the German hordes. Your army will help us in this work while our population will restore her cities and villages.  \"Again in reference, not to all purchases--as a large part of our needs will be supplied outside of the United States--but in reference to those purchases which will be made in America, we are in need of credits in dollars covering about fifty per cent of our total purchases for reconstruction. The assurance of that financial help will bring to every one in France, government and private enterprise, the courage and faith necessary to apply to peace reconstruction the energy and the spirit of enterprise she has so prominently shown during the war.  \"We will exact from Germany the restitution of each part of the material taken away from us as can be recovered. But, besides that restitution, we must bear in mind that speed is a primary condition in the reconstruction of France, and that America, on account of her immense capacities for production, ought to give us the first help. We need ships, chartered ships as well as ships transferred to our flag; the speedy reconstruction of the country is strictly depending on the revival of our mercantile fleet.  \"The colossal effort put up by the United States in the building of her fleet for war purposes will not be diverted from this sacred end if it, in part, helps France to recover on the seas, for the revival of her forces in peace, the means of transportation which were lost to her on account of the war.  \"In reference to these four items--labor; credit, raw materials, ships--I have explained in detail our needs to your administration, by whose welcome I have been deeply moved. What I told them, what I asked for, I am telling it to you again, because a policy of secrecy does not befit our day.  \"We have lost two million and a half men; some are dead, some maimed, some have returned sick and incapacitated from German prisons. Whether they be lost altogether, or whether their working capacity be permanently reduced, they will not participate in this reconstruction. The fifteenth part of our people is missing at the very time we need all our material and moral forces in order to build up our life again. The younger part, yea, the stronger part of our nation, the flower of France, has died away on the battle-fields. Our country has been bereft of its most precious resources.  \"Our war expenses, on the other side, 120,000,000,000 francs, are weighing heavily on our shoulders. To payoff this debt there are at hand only such limited resources as invasion has left us. The territories which have been under German occupation for four years were the wealthiest part of France. Their area did not exceed six per cent of the whole country. They paid, however, twenty-five per cent of the sum total of our taxes.  \"These territories which have been, for the last three months, occupied again by us at the cost of our own blood and of the blood of our allies, are now in a state of ruin even worse than we had anticipated. Of the cities and villages nothing remains but ruins; 350,000 homes have been destroyed. To build them up again--I am referring to the building proper, without the furnishings--600 million days\\' of work will be necessary, involving, together with building material, an outlay of 10,000,000,000 francs. As regards personal property of every description either destroyed by battle, or stolen by the Germans, there stands an additional loss of at least 4,000,000,000 francs.  \"This valuation of lost personal property does not include--as definite figures are lacking as yet--the countless war contributions and fines by the enemy, amounting also to billions. I need hardly say that, in those wealthy lands, practically no agricultural resources are left.  \"The losses in horses and in cattle, bovine and ovine species, hogs, goats, amount to 1,510,000 head--in agricultural equipment to 454,000 machines or carts--the two items worth together 6,000,000,000 francs.  \"Now as regards industries, the disaster is even more complete. These districts occupied by the Germans and whose machinery has been methodically destroyed or taken away by the enemy, were, industrially speaking, the very heart of France. They were the very backbone of our production, as shown in the following startling figures:  \"In 1913 the wool output of our invaded regions amounted to 94 per cent of the total. French production and corresponding figures were: For flax from the spinning mills, 90 per cent; iron ore, 90 per cent; pig iron, 83 per cent; steel, 70 per cent; sugar, 70 per cent; cotton, 60 per cent; coal 55 per cent; electric power, 45 per cent. Of all that, plants, machinery, mines, nothing is left. Everything has been carried away or destroyed by the enemy. So complete is the destruction that, in the case of our great coal mines in the north, two years of work will be needed before a single ton of coal can be extracted and ten years before the output is brought back to the figures of 1913.  \"All that must be rebuilt, and to carry out that kind of reconstruction only, there will be a need of over 2,000,000 tons of pig iron, nearly 4,000,000 tons of steel--not to mention the replenishing of stocks and of raw materials which must of necessity be supplied to the plants during the first year of resumed activity. If we take into account these different items we reach as regards industrial needs a total of 25,000,000,000 francs.  \"To resurrect these regions, to reconstruct these factories, raw materials are not now sufficient; we need means of transportation. Now the enemy has destroyed our railroad tracks, our railroad equipment, and our rolling stock, which in the first month of the war, in 1914, was reduced by 50,000 cars, has undergone the wear and tear of fifty months of war.  \"Our merchant fleet, on the other hand, has lost more than a million tons through submarine warfare. Our shipyards during the last four years have not built any ships. For they have produced for us and for our allies cannon, ammunition, and tanks. Here, again, for this item alone of means of transportation we must figure on an expense of 2,500,000,000 francs.  \"This makes, if I sum up these different items, a need of raw material which represents in cost, at the present rate of prices in France, not less than 50,000,000,000 francs.  \"And this formidable figure, gentlemen, does not cover everything. I have not taken into account the loss represented for the future production of France by the transformation of so many factories which for four years were exclusively devoted to war munitions. I have not taken into account foreign markets lost to us as a result of the destruction of one-fourth of our productive capital and the almost total collapse of our trade. I have not taken into account the economic weakening that we will suffer tomorrow owing to that loss, to which I referred a while ago, of 2,500,000 young an vigorous men.\"  This was one of the great by-products of the war. Thousands of young Americans, vigorous evangels of democratic thought, remained in Europe to bring American ideals and American force into the affairs of the old world.  Those who returned were formidable factors in re-shaping the affairs of the nation. Grave injustices were done in some instances to young men who had volunteered in the early days of the war through patriotic motives and who returned to find their places in industry taken by others. In the main, however, the process of absorption went forward steadily and without serious incident.  One factor making for satisfactory adjustment was the insurance system put into effect by the United States Government, affecting its war forces. Immediately following the armistice, the following announcement was made:   Preparations by the government for re-insuring the lives of soldiers and sailors on their return have been hastened by the signing of the armistice. Although regulations have not yet been fully drafted, it is certain that each of the 4,250,000 men in the military or naval service now holding voluntary government insurance will be permitted within five years after peace is declared to convert it without further medical examination into ordinary life, twenty-pay life, endowment maturing at the age of sixty-two, or other prescribed forms of insurance.  This insurance will be arranged by the government, not by private companies, and the cost is expected to be at least one-fourth less than similar forms offered by private agencies. The low cost will result from the fact that the government will pay all overhead administration expenses, which, for private companies, amount to about seventeen per cent of premium receipts; will save the usual solicitation fees and, in addition, bear the risk resulting from the wounding or weakening of men while in the service. Private companies would not write insurance on many wounded men, or their rates would be unusually high.  The government will arrange to collect premiums monthly, if men wish to pay that way, or for longer periods in advance. This may be done through post-offices. The minimum amount of insurance to be issued probably will be $1,000, and the maximum $10,000, with any amount between those sums in multiple of $500. There will be provision for payments in case of disability as well as death, according to the tentative plan.  Thus will be created out of the government\\'s emergency war insurance bureau the greatest life insurance institution in the world for peace times, with more policyholders and greater aggregate risks than a half dozen of the world\\'s biggest private companies combined. Out of the experience gained may eventually develop expansion of government insurance to old age, industrial and other forms of insurance, in the opinion of officials who have studied the subject.  Regulations for reinsuring returning soldiers and sailors are being framed by an advisory board to the military and naval section of the war risk bureau, consisting of Arthur Hunter, actuary of the New York Life Insurance Company; W. A. Fraser, Omaha, of the Woodmen of the World, and F. Robertson Jones, of the Workmen\\'s Compensation Publicity Bureau, New York.  Plans also are under consideration for allowing beneficiaries of men who have died or been killed in the service to choose between taking monthly payments over a period of twenty years or to commute these payments in a lump sum.    CHAPTER LV  AMERICA\\'S POSITION IN WAR AND PEACE  By common consent of the Entente Allies, President Wilson was made the spokesman for the democracy of the world. As Lloyd George, Premier Clemenceau of France, Premier Orlando of Italy, and other Europeans recognized, his utterances most clearly and cogently expressed the principles for which civilization was battling against the Hun. More than that, these statesmen and the peoples they represented recognized that back of President Wilson were the high ideals of an America pledged to the redemption of a war-weary world.  The war produced a sterility in literature. Out of the great mass that was written, however, two productions stood out in their nobility of thought and in their classic directness of expression. These were the address before Congress by President Wilson on the night of April 2, 1917, when, recognizing fully the dread responsibility of his action, he pronounced the words which led America into the World War, and the speech made by him on Monday, November 11, 1918, when addressing Congress he announced the end of the war. Other declarations of the President that will be treasured as long as democracy survives, are those enunciating the fourteen points upon which America would make peace, and two later declarations as to America\\'s purposes.  His address of April 2d was delivered before the most distinguished assemblage ever gathered within the hall of the House of Representatives. The Supreme Court of the United States, headed by the Chief Justice, every member of the embassies then resident in Washington, the entire membership of the House and Senate, and a host of the most distinguished men and women that could crowd themselves into the great hall, listened to what was virtually America\\'s Declaration of War.  The air was still and tragic suspense was upon every face as the President began his address. At first he was pale as the marble rostrum against which he leaned. As he read from small sheets typewritten with his own hand, his voice grew firmer and the flush of indignation and of resolution overspread his countenance. He said:   GENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:  I have called the Congress into extraordinary session because there are serious, very serious, choices of policy to be made, and made immediately, which it was neither right nor constitutionally permissible that I should assume the responsibility of making.  On the third of February last I officially laid before you the extraordinary announcement of the Imperial German Government that on and after the first day of February it was its purpose to put aside all restraints of law or of humanity and use its submarines to sink every vessel that sought to approach either the ports of Great Britain and Ireland on the western coasts of Europe or any of the ports controlled by the enemies of Germany within the Mediterranean. That had seemed to be the object of the German submarine warfare earlier in the war, but since April of last year the Imperial Government had somewhat restrained the commanders of its undersea craft in conformity with its promise then given to us that passenger boats should not be sunk and that due warning would be given to all other vessels which its submarines might seek to destroy, when no resistance was offered or escape attempted, and care taken that their crews were given at least a fair chance to save their lives in their open boats. The precautions taken were meager and haphazard enough, as was proved in distressing instance after instance in the progress of the cruel and unmanly business, but a certain degree of restraint was observed. The new policy has swept every restriction aside. Vessels of every kind, whatever their flag, their character, their cargo, their destination, their errand, have been ruthlessly sent to the bottom without warning and without thought of help or mercy for those on board, the vessels of friendly neutrals along with those of belligerents. Even hospital ships and ships carrying relief to the sorely bereaved and stricken people of Belgium, though the latter were provided with safe conduct through the proscribed areas by the German Government itself and were distinguished by unmistakable marks of identity, have been sunk with the same reckless lack of compassion or of principle.  I was for a little while unable to believe that such things would in fact be done by any government that had hitherto subscribed to the humane practices of civilized nations. International law had its origin in the attempt to set up some law which would be respected and observed upon the seas, where no nation had right of dominion and where lay the free highways of the world. By painful stage after stage has that law been built up, with meager enough results, indeed, after all was accomplished that could be accomplished, but always with a clear view, at least, of what the heart and conscience of mankind demanded.  This minimum of right the German Government has swept aside under the plea of retaliation and necessity and because it had no weapons which it could use at sea except these which it is impossible to employ as it is employing them without throwing to the winds all scruples of humanity or of respect for the understandings that were supposed to underlie the intercourse of the world. I am not now thinking of the loss of property involved, immense and serious as that is, but only of the wanton and wholesale destruction of the lives of noncombatants, men, women, and children, engaged in pursuits which have always, even in the darkest periods of modern history, been deemed innocent and legitimate. Property can be paid for; the lives of peaceful and innocent people can not be. The present German submarine warfare against commerce is a warfare against mankind.  It is a war against all nations: American ships have been sunk, American lives taken, in ways which it has stirred us very deeply to learn of, but the ships and people of other neutral and friendly nations have been sunk and overwhelmed in the waters in the same way. There has been no discrimination. The challenge is to all mankind. Each nation must decide for itself how it will meet it. The choice we make for ourselves must be made with a moderation of counsel and a temperateness of judgment befitting our character and our motives as a nation. We must put excited feeling away. Our motive will not be revenge or the victorious assertion of the physical might of the nation, but only the vindication of right, of human right, of which we are only a single champion.  When I addressed the Congress on the twenty-sixth of February last I thought that it would suffice to assert our neutral rights with arms, our right to use the seas against unlawful interference, our right to keep our people safe against unlawful violence. But armed neutrality, it now appears, is impracticable. Because submarines are in effect outlaws when used as the German submarines have been used against merchant shipping, it is impossible to defend ships against their attacks as the law of nations has assumed that merchantmen would defend themselves against privateers or cruisers, visible craft giving chase upon the open sea. It is common prudence in such circumstances, grim necessity indeed, to endeavor to destroy them before they have shown their own intention. They must be dealt with upon sight, if dealt with at all. The German Government denies the right of neutrals to use arms at all within the areas of the sea which it has proscribed, even in the defense of rights which no modern publicist has ever before questioned their right to defend. The intimation is conveyed that the armed guards which we have placed on our merchant ships will be treated as beyond the pale of law and subject to be dealt with as pirates would be. Armed neutrality is ineffectual enough at best; in such circumstances and in the face of such pretensions it is worse than ineffectual: it is likely only to produce what it was meant to prevent; it is practically certain to draw us into the war without either the rights or the effectiveness of belligerents. There is one choice we can not make, we are incapable of making; we will not choose the path of submission and suffer the most sacred rights of our nation and our people to be ignored or violated. The wrongs against which we now array ourselves are no common wrongs; they cut to the very roots of human life.  With a profound sense of the solemn and even tragical character of the step I am taking and of the grave responsibilities which it involves, but in unhesitating obedience to what I deem my constitutional duty, I advise that the Congress declare the recent course of the Imperial German Government to be in fact nothing less than war against the government and people of the United States; that it formally accept the status of belligerent which has thus been thrust upon it; and that it take immediate steps not only to put the country in a more thorough state of defense but also to exert all its power and employ all its resources to bring the Government of the German Empire to terms and end the war.  What this will involve is clear. It will involve the utmost practicable co-operation in counsel and action with the governments now at war with Germany, and, as incident to that, the extension to those governments of the most liberal financial credits, in order that our resources may so far as possible be added to theirs. It will involve the organization and mobilization of all the material resources of the country to supply the materials of war and serve the incidental needs of the nation in the most abundant and yet the most economical and efficient way possible. It will involve the immediate full equipment of the navy in all respects but particularly in supplying it with the best means of dealing with the enemy\\'s submarines. It will involve the immediate addition to the armed forces of the United States already provided for by law in case of war at least five hundred thousand men, who should, in my opinion, be chosen upon the principle of universal liability to service, and also the authorization of subsequent additional increments of equal force so soon as they may be needed and can be handled in training. It will involve also, of course, the granting of adequate credits to the Government, sustained, I hope, so far as they can equitably be sustained by the present generation, by well conceived taxation.  I say sustained so far as may be equitable by taxation because it seems to me that it would be most unwise to base the credits which will now be necessary entirely on money borrowed. It is our duty, I most respectfully urge, to protect our people so far as we may against the very serious hardships and evils which would be likely to arise out of the inflation which would be produced by vast loans.  In carrying out the measures by which these things are to be accomplished we should keep constantly in mind the wisdom of interfering as little as possible in our own preparation and in the equipment of our own military forces with the duty--for it will be a very practical duty--of supplying the nations already at war with Germany with the materials which they can obtain only from us or by our assistance. They are in the field and we should help them in every way to be effective there.

I shall take the liberty of suggesting, through the several executive departments of the Government, for the consideration of your committees, measures for the accomplishment of the several objects I have mentioned. I hope that it will be your pleasure to deal with them as having been framed after very careful thought by the branch of the Government upon which the responsibility of conducting the war and safeguarding the nation will most directly fall.  While we do these things, these deeply momentous things, let us be very clear, and make very clear to all the world what our motives and our objects are. My own thought has not been driven from its habitual and normal course by the unhappy events of the last two months, and I do not believe that the thought of the nation has been altered or clouded by them. I have exactly the same things in mind now that I had in mind when I addressed the Senate on the 22d of January last; the same that I had in mind when I addressed the Congress on the 3d of February and on the 26th of February. Our object now, as then, is to vindicate the principles of peace and justice in the life of the world as against selfish and autocratic power and to set up amongst the really free and self-governed peoples of the world such a concert of purpose and of action as will henceforth ensure the observance of those principles. Neutrality is no longer feasible or desirable where the peace of the world is involved and the freedom of its peoples, and the menace to that peace and freedom lies in the existence of autocratic governments backed by organized force which is controlled wholly by their will, not by the will of their people. We have seen the last of neutrality in such circumstances. We are at the beginning of an age in which it will be insisted that the same standards of conduct and of responsibility for wrong done shall be observed among nations and their governments that are observed among the individual citizens of civilized states.  We have no quarrel with the German people. We have no feeling towards them but one of sympathy and friendship. It was not upon their impulse that their government acted in entering this war. It was not with their previous knowledge or approval. It was a war determined upon as wars used to be determined upon in the old, unhappy days when peoples were nowhere consulted by their rulers and wars were provoked and waged in the interest of dynasties or of little groups of ambitious men who were accustomed to use their fellow men as pawns and tools. Self-governed nations do not fill their neighbor states with spies or set the course of intrigue to bring about some critical posture of affairs which will give them an opportunity to strike and make conquest. Such designs can be successfully worked out only under cover and where no one has the right to ask questions. Cunningly contrived plans of deception or aggression, carried, it may be, from generation to generation, can be worked out and kept from the light only within the privacy of courts or behind the carefully guarded confidences of a narrow and privileged class. They are happily impossible where public opinion commands and insists upon full information concerning all the nation\\'s affairs.  A steadfast concert for peace can never be maintained except by a partnership of democratic nations. No autocratic government could be trusted to keep faith within it or observe its covenants. It must be a league of honor, a partnership of opinion. Intrigue would eat its vitals away; the plottings of inner circles who could plan what they would and render account to no one would be a corruption seated at its very heart. Only free peoples can hold their purpose and their honor steady to a common end and prefer the interests of mankind to any narrow interest of their own.  Does not every American feel that assurance has been added to our hope for the future peace of the world by the wonderful and heartening things that have been happening within the last few weeks in Russia? Russia was known by those who knew it best to have been always in fact democratic at heart, in all the vital habits of her thoughts, in all the intimate relationships of her people that spoke their natural instinct, their habitual attitude towards life. The autocracy that crowned the summit of her political structure, long as it had stood and terrible as was the reality of its power, was not in fact Russian in origin, character, or purpose; and now it has been shaken off and the great, generous Russian people have been added in all their native majesty and might to the forces that are fighting for freedom in the world, for justice, and for peace. Here is a fit partner for a League of Honor.  One of the things that has served to convince us that the Prussian autocracy was not and could never be our friend is that from the very outset of the present war it has filled our unsuspecting communities and even our offices of government with spies and set criminal intrigues everywhere afoot against our national unity of counsel, our peace within and without, our industries and our commerce. Indeed it is now evident that its spies were here even before the war began; and it is unhappily not a matter of conjecture but a fact proved in our courts of justice that the intrigues which have more than once come perilously near to disturbing the peace and dislocating the industries of the country have been carried on at the instigation, with the support, and even under the personal direction of official agents of the Imperial Government accredited to the Government of the United States. Even in checking these things and trying to extirpate them we have sought to put the most generous interpretation possible upon them because we knew that their source lay, not in any hostile feeling or purpose of the German people towards us (who were, no doubt as ignorant of them as we ourselves were), but only in the selfish designs of a government that did what it pleased and told its people nothing. But they have played their part in serving to convince us at last that that government entertains no real friendship for us and means to act against our peace and security at its convenience. That it means to stir up enemies against us at our very doors the intercepted note to the German Minister at Mexico City is eloquent evidence.  We are accepting this challenge of hostile purpose because we know that in such a government, following such methods, we can never have a friend; and that in the presence of its organized power, always lying in wait to accomplish we know not what purpose, there can be no assured security for the democratic governments of the world. We are now about to accept gauge of battle with this natural foe to liberty and shall, if necessary, spend the whole force of the nation to check and nullify its pretensions and its power. We are glad, now that we see the facts with no veil of false pretense about them, to fight thus for the ultimate peace of the world and for the liberation of its peoples, the German peoples included: for the rights of nations great and small and the privilege of men everywhere to choose their way of life and of obedience. The world must be made safe for democracy. Its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of political liberty. We have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no conquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities for ourselves, no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make. We are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind. We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and the freedom of nations can make them.  Just because we fight without rancor and without selfish object, seeking nothing for ourselves but what we shall wish to share with all free peoples, we shall, I feel confident, conduct our operations as belligerents without passion, and ourselves observe with proud punctilio the principles of right and of fair play we profess to be fighting for.  I have said nothing of the governments allied with the Imperial Government of Germany because they have not made war upon us or challenged us to defend our right and our honor. The Austro-Hungarian Government has, indeed, avowed its unqualified endorsement and acceptance of the reckless and lawless submarine warfare adopted now without disguise by the Imperial German Government, and it has therefore not been possible for this government to receive Count Tarnowski, the Ambassador recently accredited to this government by the Imperial and Royal Government of Austria-Hungary; but that government has not actually engaged in warfare against citizens of the United States on the seas, and I take the liberty, for the present at least, of postponing a discussion of our relations with the authorities at Vienna. We enter this war only where we are clearly forced into it because there are no other means of defending our rights.  It will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves as belligerents in a high spirit of right and fairness because we act without animus, not in enmity towards a people or with the desire to bring any injury or disadvantage upon them, but only in armed opposition to an irresponsible government which has thrown aside all considerations of humanity and of right and is running amuck. We are, let me say again, the sincere friends of the German people, and shall desire nothing so much as the early re-establishment of intimate relations of mutual advantage between us--however hard it may be for them, for the time being, to believe that this is spoken from our hearts. We have borne with their present government through all these bitter months because of that friendship--exercising a patience and forbearance which would otherwise have been impossible. We shall, happily, still have an opportunity to prove that friendship in our daily attitude and actions towards the millions of men and women of German birth and native sympathy who live amongst us and share our life, and we shall be proud to prove it towards all who are in fact loyal to their neighbors and to the government in the hour of test. They are, most of them, as true and loyal Americans as if they had never known any other fealty or allegiance. They will be prompt to stand with us in rebuking and restraining the few who may be of a different mind and purpose. If there should be disloyalty, it will be dealt with with a firm hand of stern repression; but, if it lifts its head at all, it will lift it only here and there and without countenance except from a lawless and malignant few.  It is a distressing and oppressive duty, Gentlemen of the Congress, which I have performed in thus addressing you. There are, it may be, many months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of us. It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war, into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to be in the balance. But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts--for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free. To such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything that we are and everything that we have, with the pride of those who know that the day has come when America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured. God helping her, she can do no other.   His address to Congress on November 11, 1918, while all the Allied Nations were celebrating with exultant hearts the victory that had come to them, was no less dramatic than the speech that had marked the beginning of the war. He prefaced it by reading the drastic terms of the armistice granted to Germany. Continuing he said:   The war thus comes to an end; for, having accepted these terms of armistice, it will be impossible for the German command to renew it.  It is not now possible to assess the consequences of this great consummation. We know only that this tragical war, whose consuming flames swept from one nation to another until all the world was on fire, is at an end and that it was the privilege of our own people to enter it at its most critical juncture in such fashion and in such force as to contribute, in a way of which we are all deeply proud, to the great result. We know, too, that the object of the war is attained; the object upon which all free men had set their hearts; and attained with a sweeping completeness which even now we do not realize. Armed imperialism such as the men conceived who were but yesterday the masters of Germany is at an end, its illicit ambitions engulfed in black disaster. Who will now seek to revive it?  The arbitrary power of the military caste of Germany which once could secretly and of its own single choice disturb the peace of the world is discredited and destroyed. And more than that--much more than that--has been accomplished. The great nations which associated themselves to destroy it have now definitely united in the common purpose to set up such a peace as will satisfy the longing of the whole world for disinterested justice, embodied in settlements which are based upon something much better and more lasting than the selfish competitive interests of powerful states. There is no longer conjecture as to the objects the victors have in mind. They have a mind in the matter, not only, but a heart also. Their avowed and concerted purpose is to satisfy and protect the weak as well as to accord their just rights to the strong.  The humane temper and intention of the victorious governments have already been manifested in a very practical way. Their representatives in the Supreme War Council at Versailles have by unanimous resolution assured the peoples of the Central Empires that everything that is possible in the circumstances will be done to supply them with food and relieve the distressing want that is in so many places threatening their very lives; and steps are to be taken immediately to organize these efforts at relief in the same systematic manner that they were organized in the case of Belgium. By the use of the idle tonnage of the Central Empires it ought presently to be possible to lift the fear of utter misery from their oppressed populations and set their minds and energies free for the great and hazardous tasks of political reconstruction which now face them on every hand. Hunger does not breed reform; it breeds madness and all the ugly distempers that make an ordered life impossible.  For with the fall of the ancient governments, which rested like an incubus on the peoples of the Central Empires, has come political change not merely, but revolution; and revolution which seems as yet to assume no final and ordered form, but to run from one fluid change to another, until thoughtful men are forced to ask themselves, with what governments and of what sort are we about to deal in the making of the covenants of peace? With what authority will they meet us, and with what assurance that their authority will abide and sustain securely the international arrangements into which we are about to enter? There is here matter for no small anxiety and misgiving. When peace is made, upon whose promises and engagements besides our own is it to rest?  Let us be perfectly frank with ourselves and admit that these questions cannot be satisfactorily answered now or at once. But the moral is not that there is little hope of an early answer that will suffice. It is only that we must be patient and helpful and mindful above all of the great hope and confidence that lie at the heart of what is taking place. Excesses accomplish nothing. Unhappy Russia has furnished abundant recent proof of that. Disorder immediately defeats itself. If excesses should occur, if disorder should for a time raise its head, a sober second thought will follow and a day of constructive action, if we help and do not hinder.  The present and all that it holds belongs to the nations and the peoples who preserve their self-control and the orderly processes of their governments; the future to those who prove themselves the true friends of mankind. To conquer with arms is to make only a temporary conquest; to conquer the world by earning its esteem is to make permanent conquest. I am confident that the nations that have learned the discipline of freedom and that have settled with self-possession to its ordered practice are now about to make conquest of the world by the sheer power of example and of friendly helpfulness.  The peoples who have but just come out from under the yoke of arbitrary government and who are now coming at last into their freedom will never find the treasures of liberty they are in search of if they look for them by the light of the torch. They will find that every pathway that is stained with the blood of their own brothers leads to the wilderness, not to the seat of their hope. They are now face to face with their initial test. We must hold the light steady until they find themselves. And in the meantime, if it be possible, we must establish a peace that will justly define their place among the nations, remove all fear of their neighbors and of their former masters, and enable them to live in security and contentment when they have set their own affairs in order. I, for one, do not doubt their purpose or their capacity. There are some happy signs that they know and will choose the way of self-control and peaceful accommodation. If they do, we shall put our aid at their disposal in every way that we can. If they do not, we must await with patience and sympathy the awakening and recovery that will assuredly come at last.   FOURTEEN PRINCIPLES OF PEACE  On Tuesday, January 8, 1918, President Wilson placed the peace terms of the United States Government before both houses of Congress, in joint session. The fourteen principles were:  1. Open covenants of peace, openly arrived at, after which there shall be no private international understanding of any kind, but diplomacy shall proceed always frankly and in the public view.  2. Absolute freedom of navigation upon the seas, outside territorial waters, alike in peace and war, except as the seas may be closed in whole or in part by international action for the enforcement of international covenants.  3. The removal, so far as possible, of all economic barriers and the establishment of an equality of trade conditions among all the nations consenting to the peace and associating themselves for its maintenance.  4. Adequate guarantees given and taken that national armaments will be reduced to the lowest point consistent with domestic safety.  5. A free, open-minded and absolutely impartial adjustment of all Colonial claims based upon a strict observance of the principle that in determining all such questions of sovereignty, the interests of the populations concerned must have equal weight with the equitable claims of the government whose title is to be determined.  6. The evacuation of all Russian territory and such a settlement of all questions affecting Russia as will secure the best and freest co-operation of the other nations of the world in obtaining for her an unhampered and unembarrassed opportunity for the independent determination of her own political development and national policy, and assure her of a sincere welcome into the society of free nations under institutions of her own choosing; and, more than a welcome, assistance also of every kind that she may need and may herself desire. The treatment accorded Russia by her sister nations in the months to come will be the acid test of their good will, of their comprehension of her needs, as distinguished from their own interests, and of their intelligent and unselfish sympathy.  7. Belgium, the whole world will agree, must be evacuated and restored, without any attempt to limit the sovereignty which she enjoys in common with all other free nations. No other single act will serve as this will serve to restore confidence among the nations in the laws which they have themselves set and determined for the government of their relations with one another. Without this healing act the whole structure and validity of international law is forever impaired.  8. All French territory should be freed and the invaded portions restored, and the wrong done to France by Prussia in 1871, in the matter of Alsace-Lorraine, which has unsettled the peace of the world for nearly fifty years, should be righted, in order that peace may once more be made secure in the interests of all.  9. A readjustment of the frontiers of Italy should be effected along clearly recognized lines of nationality.  10. The peoples of Austria-Hungary, whose place among the nations we wish to see safeguarded and restored, should be accorded the freest opportunity of autonomous development.  11. Roumania, Serbia and Montenegro should be evacuated, occupied territories restored; Serbia accorded free and secure access to the sea, and the relations of the several Balkan States to one another determined by friendly counsel along historically established lines of allegiance and nationality; and international guarantees of the political and economic independence and territorial integrity, of the several Balkan States, should be entered into.  12. The Turkish portion of the present Ottoman Empire should be assured a secure sovereignty, but the other nationalities which are now under Turkish rule, should be assured an undoubted security of life and an absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous development, and the Dardanelles should be permanently opened as a free passage to the ships and commerce of all nations under international guarantees.  13. An independent Polish State should be erected which should include the territories inhabited by indisputably Polish populations, which should be assured a free and secure access to the sea, and whose political and economic independence and territorial integrity should be guaranteed by international covenants.  14. General association of nations must be formed under specific covenants for the purpose of affording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike.   President Wilson in his address to Congress on February 11, 1918, presented these four principles which are to be applied in arranging world peace:   1. That each part of the final settlement must be based upon the essential justice of that particular case and upon such adjustments, as are most likely to bring a peace that will be permanent.  2. That peoples and provinces are not to be bartered about from sovereignty to sovereignty as if they were mere chattels and pawns in a game, even the great game now forever discredited, of the balance of power; but that  3: Every territorial settlement must be made in the interest and for the benefit of the populations concerned, and not as part of any mere adjustment or compromise of claims amongst rival states; and,  4. That all well-defined national aspirations shall be accorded the utmost satisfaction that can be accorded them without introducing new or perpetuating old elements of discord and antagonism that would be likely in time to break the peace of Europe and consequently of the world.   President Wilson, in his Liberty Loan address in New York on September 27th, thus stated this government\\'s interpretation of its duty with regard to peace:  1. The impartial justice meted out must involve no discrimination between those to whom we wish to be just and those to whom we do not wish to be just. It must be a justice that plays no favorites and knows no standard but the equal rights of the several peoples concerned;  2. No special or separate interest of any single nation or any group of nations can be made the basis of any part of the settlement which is not consistent with the common interests of all;  3. There can be no leagues or alliances or special covenants and understandings within the general and common family of the League of Nations;  4. And more specifically, there can be no special, selfish economic combinations within the league and no employment of any form of economic boycott or exclusion except as the power of economic penalty by exclusion from the markets of the world may be vested in the League of Nations itself as a means of discipline and control.  5. All international agreements and treaties of every kind must be made known in their entirety to the rest of the world.   [Illustration: Map: Europe, North Africa, East Asia.]   THE WAR ZONE ESTABLISHED BY GERMANY, FEBRUARY, 1917, THAT BROUGHT   AMERICA INTO THE WAR.    CHAPTER LVI  THE WAR BY YEARS  Germany\\'s military strength developed during forty years of preparation, and the offensive plans of the German High Command developed in connection with an extraordinary spy service in France, Belgium, Russia, England and the United States, culminated in a simultaneous campaign on land and by sea, affecting these five nations.  AUGUST 1, 1914-AUGUST 1, 1915  Belgium and Northern France were overrun by a German invading force under General von Kluck. The heroic effort of the French army under General Joffre and a supreme strategic thrust at the German center by General Foch turned back the German tide at the battle of the Marne. The scientific diabolism of the German High Command was revealed when poison gas was projected against the Canadians at Ypres, torturing, blinding and killing thousands.  German terrorism on the high seas culminated in the sinking of the Cunard liner Lusitania by a German submarine off the Irish coast. Men, women and children to the number of 1,152 lost their lives. Of these 102 were Americans.  German colonies in South Africa were invaded by British South African troops under General Louis Botha, who during the Boer War commanded a division against the British. The German holdings at Tsing-Tau and in the Marshall Islands were seized by Japan.  German cruisers that had raided sea-going commerce were destroyed. The most noted of these was the Emden, which was defeated and destroyed by the Australian cruiser Sydney off the Cocos Islands.  German sea power was further humiliated in a running fight off Helgoland in which the battle cruiser Blucher was sunk and in a battle off the Falkland Islands in which three German cruisers were destroyed.  Italy entered the war on May 23,1915, and invaded Austria on a sixty-mile front. Russian forces, after early successes, were defeated at Tannenburg by von Hindenburg, the outstanding military genius on the German side.  The development of aircraft as an aid to artillery and as a destructive force on its own account, was rapid, and the use of machine guns and hand grenades in trench operations became general.   AUGUST 1, 1915-AUGUST 1, 1916  The tragic sea and land operations at the Dardanelles and Gallipoli marked this year with red in British history. Sir Douglas Haig succeeded Sir John French as Commander-in-Chief of British forces in France. The outstanding operation of the British forces on the western front was the bloody battle of the Somme, beginning July 1st, and continuing until the fall of 1915. The losses on both sides in that titanic struggle staggered two continents. Especially heroic were the attacks of the Canadians in that great battle and especially heavy were the losses in killed and wounded of the Canadian regiments. They ranked in magnitude with the depletion that came to the Australian and New Zealand armies in the fatal Gallipoli campaign.  This year will be glorious forever in the annals of France because of the heroic defense at Verdun. That battle tested to the limit the offensive strength of the German machine and it was found lacking in power to pierce the superhuman defense of the heroic French forces under Petain and Nivelle.  Bulgaria entered the war on October 14, 1915, with a declaration of war against helpless Serbia. Greece, torn by internal dissensions, inclined first to one side, then to the other. The occupation of Saloniki by French and British expeditionary forces finally swung the archipelago to the Allies.  A British Mesopotamian force under General Townshend, poorly equipped and unsupported, was cut off in Kut-el-Amara, and surrendered to the Turks on April 29, 1916.  The Italian forces under General Cadorna made a sensational advance terminating in the capture of Gorizia. Portugal entered the war on the side of the Allies after it had refused to give up to Germany several German ships interned in Portuguese ports.  An object lesson in German submarine possibilities was given America when the Deutschland, a super-submarine cargo vessel, arrived in Baltimore, Maryland, on July 9, 1916. The Deutschland later was converted into a naval submarine and re-visited American shores, sinking a number of merchant vessels. It was one of the German submarine fleet surrendered to the Allies in November, 1918.  Russia proved itself to be a military ineffective. German armies under von Mackensen and von Hindenburg occupied Warsaw, Brest-Litovsk, Lutsk, and Grodno. Grand Duke Nicholas was removed from the command of the Russian armies and Czar Nicholas assumed command.  Germany\\'s pretensions to sea power ended with the battle of Jutland, May 31, 1916, when its High Seas fleet fled after a running fight with British cruisers and destroyers. Never, thereafter, during the war did the German ships venture out of the Bight of Helgoland.   AUGUST 1, 1916-AUGUST 1, 1917  This year was marked by two dramatic episodes. The first of these was the sudden entrance and the equally sudden exit of Roumania as a factor in the World War.  The second was the appearance of the United States which became the deciding factor in the war.  Roumania created enthusiasm in Allied countries when it declared war on Austria-Hungary August 27th. A sudden descent by a Roumanian army into Transylvania on August 30th was hailed as the harbinger of further successes. These hopes were turned to ashes when von Mackensen headed an irresistible German and Austrian rush which fairly inundated Roumania. The retreat from Transylvania by the Roumanians was turned into a rout. Bulgarian forces invaded the Dobrudja region of Roumania and on November 28th the seat of the Roumanian Government was transferred from Bucharest, the capital, to Jassy. Roumania ceased to be a factor in the war on December 6th, when Bucharest fell to von Mackensen. Emperor Franz Josef of Austria-Hungary died on November 22d, while Austrian hopes were at their highest.  America\\'s appearance as a belligerent was forecast on January 31, 1917, when Germany announced its intention of sinking all vessels in a blockade zone around the British Isles. Count von Bernstorff was handed his passports on February 3d, and on April 2d President Wilson, in a remarkable address to Congress, advised a declaration of war by the United States against Germany. This was consummated by a formal vote of Congress declaring war on April 6th.  This action by America was followed by the organization of a Council of National Defense. Under this body the resources of the nation were mobilized. The council was later virtually abandoned as an organizing factor, its functions going to the War Industries Board, presided over by Bernard Baruch; the Fuel Administration, under Dr. Harry A. Garfield; the War Trade Board, with Vance C. McCormick at its head; and other governmental bodies. George Creel headed the Committee on Public Information.  Conscription was decided upon as the foundation of America\\'s war-making policy, and the training of officers and privates in great training camps was commenced. Great shipping and aircraft programs were formulated and the nation as a whole was placed upon a war footing.  The Russian revolution beginning in bread riots in Petrograd, spread throughout that country, with the result that Russia disappeared as one of the Entente Allies.   FROM AUGUST 1, 1917-NOVEMBER 11, 1918  America\\'s might and efficiency were revealed in the speed and thoroughness with which her military, naval and civilian resources were mobilized and thrown into the conflict. Under the supervision of the Chief of Staff, two million American soldiers received the final touches in their military training and were transported safely overseas. They became the decisive factor in the war during the summer and fall of 1918. To their glory be it recorded they never retreated. Chateau-Thierry, St. Mihiel, Siecheprey, Boureches Wood, Cantigny, Belleau Wood, the Argonne, Sedan and Stenay are names that will rank in American history with Yorktown, New Orleans and Gettysburg. The \"land of dollars\" became over night the \"land of high ideals\" to the civilized world. Lightless nights in cities, restriction of the use of gasoline on Sundays and daylight-saving legislation linked civilians to soldiers in war effort.  Italy suffered a severe reverse beginning October 24, 1917, when the German forces rushed through a portion of the Italian army that had been honey-combed with pro-German Socialistic propaganda.  Canada again emblazoned its name in history through the heroic capture of Passchendaele on November 6, 1917.  The Russian revolution turned to the Bolsheviki when Lenine and Trotsky at the head of the Reds seized Petrograd on November 7th and deposed Alexander Kerensky, leader of the Moderate Socialists. The Czar Nicholas was executed by the victorious Bolsheviki and the Imperial family made captives.  The British Mesopotamian forces advanced into Palestine and Mesopotamia, destroying the Turkish army under Ahmed Bey in a battle terminating September 29, 1917. General Stanley Maude, the leader of the expedition, died in Mesopotamia November 18, 1917.  General Allenby commanding British and Arabian forces, routed and destroyed three Turkish armies in Palestine, capturing Jerusalem which had been held by the Turks for six hundred and seventy three years.  The turning point of the war came on March 29, 1918, when General Foch was chosen Commander-in-Chief of all the Allied forces. This followed Germany\\'s great drive on a fifty-mile front from Arras to La Fere. Successive German thrusts were halted by the Allied forces now strongly reinforced by Americans.  Foch, patiently biding his time, elected to halt the German drive with Americans. The Marines of the United States forces were given the post of honor, and at Chateau-Thierry the counter-thrust of Foch was commenced by a complete defeat of the Prussian Guard and other crack German regiments, by the untried soldiers of America.  From Chateau-Thierry to the armistice which went into effect at eleven o\\'clock on November 11th was only a short span of time, but in it was compressed the humiliation of arrogant Teutonic imperialism, the destruction of militaristic autocracy, and the liberation of the world.    CHAPTER LVII  BEHIND AMERICA\\'S BATTLE LINE  GENERAL MARCH\\'S OWN STORY OF THE WORK OF THE MILITARY INTELLIGENCE DIVISION--OF THE WAR PLANS DIVISION--OF THE PURCHASE AND TRAFFIC DIVISION--HOW MEN, MUNITIONS AND SUPPLIES REACHED THE WESTERN FRONT.  It is important that a general summary of America\\'s military preparations, a detailed description of the operations behind the battle line and a detailed chronology of America\\'s principal military operations in France during the year 1918 should be presented to the reader. Such a summary is afforded by the report of General Peyton C. March, Chief of Staff, United States Army, for the last year of the war. Addressing the Secretary of War, General March wrote in part:   The signing of the armistice on November 11, 1918, has brought to a successful conclusion the most remarkable achievement in the history of all warfare.  The entry of the United States into the war on April 6, 1917, found the Nation about as thoroughly unprepared for the great task which was confronting it as any great nation which had ever engaged in war. Starting from a minimum of organized strength, within this short period of sixteen months the entire resources of the country in men, money, and munitions have been placed under central control, and at the end of this period the Nation was in its full stride and had accomplished, from a military standpoint, what our enemy regarded as the impossible. The most important single thing, perhaps, in this record of accomplishment, was the immediate passage by Congress of the draft law, without which it would have been impossible to have raised the men necessary for victory. In organizing, training, and supplying the vast numbers of men made available by the draft law very many changes have been made necessary in the organization of the War Department and in the methods existing therein which were inherited from the times of profound peace.  Shortly after my installation as Chief of Staff I adopted the principle of interchange of the personnel of the various staff corps of the War Department with men who had training in France, and in the application of this principle placed as the heads of various bureaus officers selected on account of their ability and experience in the system of warfare as conducted in France.  At this time, also, I found that the divisions organized in our armies were still regarded as separate units, designated by different titles in accordance with their origin. This made three different kinds of divisions in the United States army--the Regular army, the National Guard, and National army divisions. All these distinctions were abolished and the entire army consolidated into a United States army, without regard to the source from which drawn. The source of supply of all replacements for the various elements of the army, without regard to their origin, was drafted men; and the titles had no significance whatever and were a source of possible disturbance from the standpoint of military efficiency. There was, in fact, no actual difference between these divisions with respect to efficiency--all have done high-grade work from whatever source drawn. All have shown courage and capacity for quick absorption of the fundamentals of modern military training and irresistible dash and force in actual fighting.  When I returned from France on March 1, 1918, I came back with the belief that the most fundamental necessity, both for the American Expeditionary Force and for the success of the allies, was that the shipment of troops to France should be vastly increased and should have priority over everything else; and as this policy became effective a study was instituted looking to our putting in France, if that was possible, enough men to bring the war to a conclusion in the shortest period possible. After a study of the entire situation, including as accurate an estimate of the potential strength of our allies on the western front and of the probable German strength as was possible, I came to the conclusion that the war might be brought to an end in 1919, provided we were able to land in France by June 30th of that year eighty American divisions of a strength of 3,360,000 men. On July 18, 1918, I submitted to you a formal memorandum, accompanied by a study of methods by which the men could be obtained, the supplies procured, and an analysis of the shipping which must be obtained in order to accomplish this very large military program. This was accompanied by an estimate of the cost of the proposed program.  In this study I recommended to you the adoption, as the American program, of eighty divisions in France and eighteen at home by June 30, 1919, based on a total strength of the American army of 4,850,000 men. This was approved by you and by the President of the United States and adopted as our formal military program. To carry this program into effect required the adoption by Congress of a change in the draft ages so as to include men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five years, and also created a deficiency over the enormous appropriations already made by Congress of some $7,000,000,000. The presentation of the program to Congress, accompanied by the statement that this increase in the army, if laws were passed by Congress which would make it effective, would lead to success in 1919, produced prompt and favorable consideration by that body. Up to the signing of the armistice troops were being transported to France monthly in accordance with that program. The results speak for themselves....

In the towns and villages soldiers were assigned or   \"billeted\" to the houses of the inhabitants with the result that a   deep mutual respect grew up between the two nationalities.   During the year, the most important in the history of the country both from a military and civil standpoint, there have been four heads of the General Staff: Major-General Hugh L. Scott, from the outbreak of the war until his retirement, September 22, 1917; General Tasker H. Bliss, from that date until May 19, 1918; Major-General John Biddle, Acting Chief of Staff at periods during the absence of General Bliss in France, from October 29, 1917, to December 16, 1917, and from January 9, 1918, to March 3, 1918. I assumed the duties of Acting Chief of Staff on March 4, 1918, became Chief of Staff May 20, 1918, and have continued on that duty since.  It was evident, as the war progressed, that the General Staff was acting under an organization and in accordance with regulations which were not only unsuited to the duties and responsibilities confronting it, but were wholly out of date and were not suited to any General Staff organization. Successive revisions of the orders under which the General Staff was acting were made as events demanded, until the experience of the year crystallized the organization of the General Staff into that set forth in General Order No. 80 of the War Department. This order divides the work of the General Staff into four primary divisions: 1. Operations; 2. Purchase, Storage, and Traffic; 3. Military Intelligence; 4. War Plans. Each of these divisions is under the direction of a director; who is Assistant Chief of Staff and is a general officer.   OPERATIONS DIVISION  The Operations Division is under the charge of Major-General Henry Jervey, United States army, as Director of Operations and Assistant Chief of Staff. This division is a consolidation of the former Operations Committee and Equipment Committee, which pertained to the War College under the previous organization. The Operations Division has had charge of the increase in the personnel of the army during the year. On June 30, 1917, the Regular army consisted of 250,357 officers and enlisted men. On August 5,1917, 379,323 officers and men of the National Guard were drafted into the Federal service. There were a few special drafts of small numbers of National Guardsmen into the Federal service after August 5, 1917. During the period covered by this report this division handled the calls into service of men obtained under the draft, the organization of these men into divisions and units necessary for the army, and turned over for shipment overseas up to November 8, 1918, 2,047,667 men. The grand total of men in the army from returns for the period ending October 15th is 3,624,774. This force was organized into divisions, the proper proportion of corps, army, and service of supply troops, and of replacement camps and training centers for Infantry, Field Artillery, and Machine Guns in the United States. Central officers\\' training schools were organized at each of the replacement camps. Replacement camps and training centers for the various staff departments were also organized. Development battalions were organized at all division camps and large posts and camps for the purpose of developing men of poor physique and the instruction of illiterates and non-English-speaking men of the draft. During the fiscal year 5,377,468 officers and men were moved by railroad to and from the camps.  The Operations Division has during the year also handled all matters connected with the adoption of new types of equipment, fixing allowances for various units, the preparation of tables of equipment for them, and the distribution and issue of equipment, and the determination of priorities of such issue.  It has supervised and studied the needs of camps and construction work therein, and this work in general has been characterized by marked ability and devotion to duty.   PURCHASE, STORAGE AND TRAFFIC DIVISION  The Division of Purchase, Storage and Traffic is under the charge of Major-General George W. Goethals, United States army, as Assistant Chief of Staff and Director of Purchase, Storage and Traffic. This division was organized by merging divisions previously created, and which had been called \"Storage and Traffic\" and \"Purchase and Supply.\" The new division thus organized was subdivided into Embarkation Service, Storage, Inland Traffic Service, and Purchase and Supply Branch.  Embarkation.--At the outbreak of the war the Quartermaster\\'s Department had charge of the transportation of troops and supplies and continued to exercise these functions until August 4, 1917, when they were transferred to a separate division of the General Staff, specially created for the purpose, and designated as the Embarkation Service. As already noted, this was subsequently merged with the Storage and Traffic Division.  Two primary ports of embarkation were established, one with headquarters at Hoboken, N. J., and the other at Newport News, Va., each under the command of a general officer.  The Quartermaster\\'s Department was operating a service to Panama from New York, but with the shipment of troops to France a new condition arose which was met only in part by taking over the Hoboken piers, formerly owned by the Hamburg-American and North German Lloyd steamship companies, and the magnitude of the undertaking necessitated additional facilities. The situation at New York is complicated by the large amount of general shipping using the port, the diversified interests, even those of the government, and the complicated jurisdiction. An effort was made to bring about such a consolidation and unification as to secure greater co-operation with increased efficiency. To this end the War Board for the Port of New York was established in November, 1917. It was vested with full power and authority to make rules and regulations for operating the facilities of the port, to determine priorities, and to do what was necessary to provide for the prompt and economical dispatch of the business of the government in and about the port. Mr. Irving T. Bush was selected as the board\\'s representative, with the title of chief executive officer. In addition to representing the board he was to arrange for the co-operative use of piers, warehouses, lighterage, terminals, railroads, trucking, and all other transportation facilities in and about the port.  In addition the need was felt for having a shipping expert closely associated with the Embarkation Service, familiar with the facilities at various ports, so that he could properly assign ships, select ships for the cargo to be moved, and arrange for their loading. Mr. Joseph T. Lilly was selected for this work and appointed director of embarkation.  In February, 1918, the available cargo ships were not sufficient to carry the supplies needed for maintaining the troops overseas. To secure the requisite additional tonnage necessitated taking ships from the existing trade routes and determining from what imports and exports they could best be spared without interference with those which were absolutely necessary. This brought about a new situation which could be handled only by those having a knowledge of the trades as well as the characteristics of various ships serving them, since some of them were suitable for War Department needs and some were not. It had happened that an advantageous exchange of ships could have been made with the Allies by which valuable time could have been saved in getting over cargo, but there was lack of knowledge as well as lack of authority. The whole situation was gone over at a conference between the Secretary of War and the chairman of the Shipping Board, as a result of which the Shipping Control Committee was created, consisting of Mr. P. A. S. Franklin, chairman; Mr. H. H. Raymond; and Sir Connop Guthrie, representative of the Allies\\' shipping interests. The allocation and distribution of available tonnage, as well as questions of exchange of ships, was vested in this committee. So far as the work of the War Department was concerned the committee was charged with the loading and unloading cargo, coaling, supplies, repairs, and, except where vessels are commanded by the navy, of inspection and manning. They also have charge of the management and operation of docks, piers, slips, loading and discharging facilities under the control of the department, or of any board, officers, or agency operating such facilities, together with the direction and management of minor craft to be used in connection with the handling of steamers and their cargoes in port. The amount of cargo shipped overseas, the efficiency of the loading, and the reduction of the time of stay in the ports attest to the efficient manner in which the committee has operated, and it is not too much to say that they are to be largely credited with the results that have been accomplished.  Expeditionary depots were operated at Boston, Mass., Philadelphia, Pa., and Baltimore, Md., primarily for the movement of freight. When cargo ships having accommodations for troops were loaded at these ports troops for the available space were sent from the camps under the direction of the commanding general at Hoboken; similarly shipments of troops were made from Montreal, Canada, and Halifax, Nova Scotia, when practicable. Cargo shipments were also made from other ports on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts.  On May 25, 1918, the water transport branch of the Quartermaster\\'s Department was transferred and made a part of the Embarkation Service.  In April conditions abroad necessitated the speeding up shipments of troops, and brought to the service such transports as the British Government could spare for the purpose, which have been continued in use. The army transports are officered and manned by the navy, as is the greater number of the cargo ships. The arrangements for transferring ships to naval control as well as for convoys for troop and cargo ships are handled through the Chief of Operations of the navy, who has given every assistance. The way in which the work has been handled by the navy is shown by the loss of no troop ships which were under their protection on the eastbound trips.  Inland Traffic.--The inland traffic service was established on January 10, 1918. As the government had taken over all of the railroads, the necessity for working in harmony with the organization that was placed in charge was apparent, and the Railroad Administration was requested to recommend a competent traffic man to handle the work. This resulted in the selection and assignment of Mr. H. M. Adams as chief of the section. He in turn secured his expert assistants through the Railroad Administration.  At the time the section was formed approximately 15,000 carloads of War Department property held in cars were congesting various Atlantic ports. Steps were taken which relieved this condition and brought about an orderly movement of the traffic when and in the quantities desired. The value of the inland traffic service was soon demonstrated and led to a reorganization, with authority to take over the transportation organizations of the various bureaus of the War Department, both at Washington and throughout the country, so that as now organized the chief of the inland traffic service exercises direct control of the transportation of troops, of the supplies of and for the various bureaus of the War Department, and for the contractors working for the several bureaus. This control extends over the entire country through the medium of representatives stationed at various traffic centers.  Working in conjunction with the Railroad Administration has resulted in minimizing the burdens of the carriers. The work has been performed most efficiently. More than 5,000,000 troops have been moved from their homes, from one camp to another, and from camps to the points of embarkation within the period covered by this report.  Arrangements have been made by which this branch will take charge of all express movements for the War Department, as well as the tracing of the movements of all War Department property, including the contractors and others for the various bureaus.  Purchase and Supply.--The Purchase and Supply Branch is organized into the following subsections: Supply Program, Purchase, Production, Finance, and Emergency.   MILITARY INTELLIGENCE DIVISION  The Military Intelligence Division has as director Brigadier-General Marlborough Churchill, United States army, Assistant Chief of Staff. This division, which had been a branch, first of the War Plans Division and then of the Executive Division of the General Staff, was separated completely and made an independent division by general orders which reorganized the General Staff, thus putting the Military Intelligence Division on a par with similar services of general staffs of other nations of the world.  The duties of the Military Intelligence Division consist, in general, in the organization of the intelligence service, positive and negative, including the collection and coordination of military information; the supervision of the department intelligence officers and intelligence officers at posts, stations, camps, and with commands in the field, in matters relating to military intelligence; the direction of counter-espionage work; the preparation of instruction in military intelligence work for the use of our forces; the consideration of questions of policy promulgated by the General Staff in all matters of military intelligence; the co-operation with intelligence branches of the general staffs of other countries; the supervision of the training of officers for intelligence duty, the obtaining and issuing of maps: and the disbursement of and accounting for intelligence funds.  One of the important functions of the Director of the Military Intelligence Division is that of coordinating the work of this service with other intelligence agencies. Possible duplications of work and investigation by the State Department, Treasury Department, Department of Justice, Navy Department, War Trade Board, and the War Department are avoided or adjusted at weekly conferences held at the Department of Justice and attended by representatives of these departments who consider matters of common interest. For a similar purpose, the Director of Military Intelligence is a member of the Fire Prevention Committee, the War Industries Board, and the National Research Council.  For the purpose of securing close co-operation between the military intelligence services of the nations associated in the war, the British and French Governments were requested by the United States to send officers to this country for liaison duty. These officers have been of great assistance in accomplishing this end, because of their knowledge of the details of intelligence work in Europe.  For the performance of the service for which the Military Intelligence Division was developed, eight sections have been established, each dealing with its peculiar problems, and working in close liaison with its fellows....  It may not be amiss to call attention to the enthusiastic co-operation which this division has consistently received from the various other intelligence agencies, civilian and others. The American Protective League, the Department of Justice, the Office of Naval Intelligence, the Customs, the War Trade Intelligence have all co-operated in the heartiest manner with each and every effort of the Military Intelligence Division. Indeed, it is hardly saying too much to state that the success of the Military Intelligence Division has in a very large measure been due to the loyal assistance which it has received at all times from the various agencies whose functions are similar to its own.   WAR PLANS DIVISION  The War Plans Division of the General Staff is under the direction of Brigadier-General Lytle Brown, as Director and Assistant Chief of Staff. A very large volume of work has been accomplished by this division during the year. Exclusive of subjects pertaining to the historical branch, the inventions section, and routine matters, 9,287 cases were handled by the division during the year.  These included studies as to policies for defense and the organization of the military forces in general as published in Tables of Organization, completed studies on the policy and plans for training the army in general, training replacement troops, training cadres, training centers, training schools, schools for senior and staff officers, and plans for physical reconstruction and vocational training of wounded soldiers.  In addition, through the Training Section, the War Plans Division has supervision of training in general and has kept in touch by inspections by its officers with methods used and progress made.  The Legislative, Regulations, and Rules Branch of the War Plans Division has handled numerous changes in Army Regulations and War Department orders made necessary by the present emergency, and has considered bills before Congress pertaining to the army.  The Historical Branch of the General Staff was organized March 5, 1918, to collect and compile the records pertaining to the war under the approved policy, and satisfactory progress is being made. To June 30, 1918, 67,022 photographs and 2,590 feet of motion-picture film had been received.  The Inventions Section was organized April 16, 1918. This section has taken over from the different agencies of the government the preliminary consideration of inventions and ideas of inventions of a military nature, with a view to placing before the proper bureaus of the War Department those having sufficient military value to warrant test and development at the expense of the government. From April 16, 1918, to June 30, 1918, 4,645 cases were handled, a number of which were of exceptional merit and have already been put to use....  The Chief of Staff has as his principal assistant Major-General Frank McIntyre, United States army, who acts as executive officer for the General Staff and also for the Chief of Staff in his absence.  Beside the General Staff divisions which have been referred to in the foregoing, there has been established in the General Staff a Morale Section, under charge of Brigadier-General E. L. Munson, United States army, which has for its object primarily the stimulation of morale throughout the army, and maintaining a close connection and liaison with similar activities in civil life. This section had only gotten fairly into operation before the signing of the armistice, but had already shown its value as a military asset.  Another important addition to the organization of the General Staff has been the establishment of a Personnel Section, under charge of Brigadier-General P. P. Bishop, United States army. In this section has been consolidated the handling of appointments, promotions, and commissions of the entire official personnel of the United States army. This section has proved to be of the greatest value and has come to stay.  The signing of the armistice has interrupted the conclusion of the organization now under way for the consolidation of Procurement and Storage under the Director of Purchase, Storage, and Traffic, but the principle is sound from the standpoint of organization and extremely economical in its results.  The supply of officers for the very large military program has been throughout one of the most important problems which confronted the General Staff. I have already indicated in the statement of the functions of the Operations Division of the General Staff the organization of central training camps for officers throughout the United States. When, however, we embarked upon the final program of placing eighty divisions in France and eighteen at home by June 30, 1919, which involved an army of approximately 4,800,000, the problem of the supply of officers became so serious that an understanding was obtained with the great mass of educational institutions throughout the United States, resulting in the development of the Student Army Training Corps. This scheme absorbed for military purposes the academic plants of some 518 colleges and universities throughout the country, and for vocational training in the army embraced some eighty more. This corps was put under the charge of Brigadier-General Robert I. Rees, United States army, and in its development we have had the energetic cooperation of college presidents and responsible college authorities throughout the entire United States. At the same time, in order to increase the supply of officers, the course at West Point was cut down to one year\\'s intensive training, with the idea of placing at the disposal of the government 1,000 officers a year graduated from that extremely efficient plant rather than the graduation of about 200, which had been the case previously throughout the war.  The separation of the Air Service from the Signal Corps, under the provisions of the Overman bill, and the establishment of a Bureau of Military Aeronautics, under Major-General William L. Kenly, United States army, and of a Bureau of Aircraft Production, under Mr. John D. Ryan, marked an extremely important step forward in the development of this portion of the Military Establishment. The armistice closes out this matter with the two branches of the Air Service in a state of marked efficiency and establishes unquestionably the necessity for the permanent separation of the Air Service from the Signal Corps in the reorganization of the army.  During this period another new agency created in the War Department by Executive order was the office of the Chief of Field Artillery. This office has been filled by Major-General William J. Snow, United States army. This establishment was accompanied by the creation in the American Expeditionary Force in France of the office of Chief of Artillery on General Pershing\\'s staff, having similar relation to all the artillery of the Expeditionary Force which the Chief of Field Artillery has toward the mobile artillery at home. The work of this office has been accompanied by a marked increase in the efficiency of the training system in the various Field Artillery camps, and the office itself has proved to be of distinct value.  I have directed the divisions of the General Staff concerned to study and submit for your consideration a plan for the reorganization of our army, which will take advantage of our experience in this war, which has brought about many changes in organization of all arms of the service, and has developed new arms not known when the war started. The Air Service, the Tank Corps, the development of heavy mobile artillery, the proper organization of divisions, corps, and armies, all will be set forth in the scheme which will be submitted to you with the recommendation that it be transmitted for the consideration of Congress.   The conduct of the American troops in France, their progressive development in military experience and ability, the fine staff work, and the modesty and gallantry of the individual soldier is a matter of pride to all Americans. General Pershing and his command have earned the thanks of the American people.  The work of General Tasker H. Bliss as military representative of the War Department with the American Section of the Supreme War Council at Versailles has been of the greatest value to the War Department.  I cannot close this report without making of record the appreciation of the War Department of the work of the many trained and patriotic officers of the army whom the destiny of war did not call to France. These officers, forced to remain behind in the United States by the imperative necessity of having trained men to keep the machine moving, have kept up their work with such intelligence, zeal, and devotion to duty as to show a high order of patriotism. The officers and men who have not been able on account of the armistice to be transported to France deserve also, with their comrades in France, the thanks of the American people.    CHAPTER LVIII  GENERAL PERSHING\\'S OWN STORY [Footnote: From General Pershing\\'s official report to the Secretary of War. November 20, 1918]  Immediately upon receiving my orders I selected a small staff and proceeded to Europe in order to become familiar with conditions at the earliest possible moment.  The warmth of our reception in England and France was only equaled by the readiness of the commanders-in-chief of the veteran armies of the Allies and their staffs to place their experience at our disposal. In consultation with them the most effective means of co-operation of effort was considered. With French and British armies at their maximum strength, and all efforts to dispossess the enemy from his firmly intrenched positions in Belgium and France failed, it was necessary to plan for an American force adequate to turn the scale in favor of the Allies. Taking account of the strength of the central powers at that time, the immensity of the problem which confronted us could hardly be overestimated. The first requisite being an organization that could give intelligent direction to effort, the formation of a General Staff occupied my early attention.   GENERAL STAFF  A well-organized General Staff through which the commander exercises his functions is essential to a successful modern army. However capable our division, our battalion, and our companies as such, success would be impossible without thoroughly coordinated endeavor. A General Staff broadly organized and trained for war had not hitherto existed in our army. Under the Commander-in-Chief, this staff must carry out the policy and direct the details of administration, supply, preparation, and operations of the army as a whole, with all special branches and bureaus subject to its control. As models to aid us we had the veteran French General Staff and the experience of the British who had similarly formed an organization to meet the demands of a great army. By selecting from each the features best adapted to our basic organization, and fortified by our own early experience in the war, the development of our great General Staff system was completed.  The General Staff is naturally divided into five groups, each with its chief who is an assistant to the Chief of the General Staff. G. 1 is in charge of organization and equipment of troops, replacements, tonnage, priority of overseas shipment, the auxiliary welfare association and cognate subjects; G. 2 has censorship, enemy intelligence, gathering and disseminating information, preparation of maps, and all similar subjects; G. 3 is charged with all strategic studies and plans, movement of troops, and the supervision of combat operations; G. 4 coordinates important questions of supply, construction, transport arrangements for combat, and of the operations of the service of supply, and of hospitalization and the evacuation of the sick and wounded; G. 5 supervises the various schools and has general direction and coordination of education and training.  The first Chief of Staff was Col. (now Maj.-Gen.) James G. Harbord, who was succeeded in March, 1918, by Maj.-Gen. James W. McAndrew. To these officers, to the deputy chief of staff, and to the assistant chiefs of staff, who, as heads of sections, aided them, great credit is due for the results obtained not only in perfecting the General Staff organization but in applying correct principles to the multiplicity of problems that have arisen.   ORGANIZATION AND TRAINING  After a thorough consideration of allied organizations it was decided that our combat division should consist of four regiments of infantry of 3,000 men, with three battalions to regiment and four companies of 250 men each to a battalion, and of an artillery brigade of three regiments, a machine-gun battalion, an engineer regiment, a trench-mortar battery, a signal battalion, wagon trains, and the headquarters staffs and military police. These, with medical and other units, made a total of over 28,000 men, or practically double the size of a French or German division. Each corps would normally consist of six divisions--four combat and one depot and one replacement division--and also two regiments of cavalry, and each army of from three to five corps.  With four divisions fully trained, a corps could take over an American sector with two divisions in line and two in reserve, with the depot and replacement divisions prepared to fill the gaps in the ranks.  Our purpose was to prepare an integral American force, which should be able to take the offensive in every respect. Accordingly, the development of a self-reliant infantry by thorough drill in the use of the rifle and in the tactics of open warfare was always uppermost. The plan of training after arrival in France allowed a division one month for acclimatization and instruction in small units from battalions down, a second month in quiet trench sectors by battalion, and a third month after it came out of the trenches when it should be trained as a complete division in war of movement....   ARTILLERY, AIRPLANES, AND TANKS  Our entry into the war found us with few of the auxiliaries necessary for its conduct in the modern sense. Among our most important deficiencies in material were artillery, aviation, and tanks. In order to meet our requirements as rapidly as possible, we accepted the offer of the French Government to provide us with the necessary artillery equipment of seventy-fives, one fifty-five millimeter howitzers, and one fifty-five G P F guns from their own factories for thirty divisions. The wisdom of this course is fully demonstrated by the fact that, although we soon began the manufacture of these classes of guns at home, there were no guns of the calibers mentioned manufactured in America on our front at the date the armistice was signed. The only guns of these types produced at home thus far received in France are 109 seventy-five millimeter guns.  In aviation we were in the same situation, and here again the French Government came to our aid until our own aviation program should be under way. We obtained from the French the necessary planes for training our personnel, and they have provided us with a total of 2,676 pursuit, observation, and bombing planes. The first airplanes received from home arrived in May, and altogether we have received 1,379. The first American squadron completely equipped by American production, including airplanes, crossed the German lines on August 7, 1918. As to tanks, we were also compelled to rely upon the French. Here, however, we were less fortunate, for the reason that the French production could barely meet the requirements of their own armies.  It should be fully realized that the French Government has always taken a most liberal attitude and has been most anxious to give us every possible assistance in meeting our deficiencies in these as well as in other respects. Our dependence upon France for artillery, aviation, and tanks was, of course, due to the fact that our industries had not been exclusively devoted to military production. All credit is due our own manufacturers for their efforts to meet our requirements, as at the time the armistice was signed we were able to look forward to the early supply of practically all our necessities from our own factories.  The welfare of the troops touches my responsibility, as Commander-in-Chief to the mothers and fathers and kindred of the men who came to France in the impressionable period of youth. They could not have the privilege accorded European soldiers during their periods of leave of visiting their families and renewing their home ties. Fully realizing that the standard of conduct that should be established for them must have a permanent influence in their lives and on the character of their future citizenship, the Red Cross, the Young Men\\'s Christian Association, Knights of Columbus, the Salvation Army, and the Jewish Welfare Board, as auxiliaries in this work, were encouraged in every possible way. The fact that our soldiers, in a land of different customs and language, have borne themselves in a manner in keeping with the cause for which they fought, is due not only to the efforts in their behalf but much more to other high ideals, their discipline, and their innate sense of self-respect. It should be recorded, however, that the members of these welfare societies have been untiring in their desire to be of real service to our officers and men. The patriotic devotion of these representative men and women has given a new significance to the Golden Rule, and we owe to them a debt of gratitude that can never be repaid.   COMBAT OPERATIONS  During our periods of training in the trenches some of our divisions had engaged the enemy in local combats, the most important of which was Seicheprey by the Twenty-sixth on April 20th, in the Toul sector, but none had participated in action as a unit. The First Division, which had passed through the preliminary stages of training, had gone to the trenches for its first period of instruction at the end of October and by March 21st, when the German offensive in Picardy began, we had four divisions with experience in the trenches, all of which were equal to any demands of battle action. The crisis which this offensive developed was such that our occupation of an American sector must be postponed.  On March 28th I placed at the disposal of Marshal Foch, who had been agreed upon as Commander-in-Chief of the Allied armies, all of our forces to be used as he might decide. At his request the First division was transferred from the Toul sector to a position in reserve at Chaumont en Vexin. As German superiority in numbers required prompt action, an agreement was reached at the Abbeville conference of the Allied premiers and commanders and myself on May 2d by which British shipping was to transport ten American divisions to the British army area, where they were to be trained and equipped, and additional British shipping was to be provided for as many divisions as possible for use elsewhere.  On April 26th the First Division had gone into the line in the Montdidier salient on the Picardy battle front. Tactics had been suddenly revolutionized to those of open warfare, and our men, confident of the results of their training, were eager for the test. On the morning of May 28th this division attacked the commanding German position in its front, taking with splendid dash the town of Cantigny and all other objectives, which were organized and held steadfastly against vicious counter-attacks and galling artillery fire. Although local, this brilliant action had an electrical effect, as it demonstrated our fighting qualities under extreme battle conditions, and also that the enemy\\'s troops were not altogether invincible.  The Germans\\' Aisne offensive, which began on May 27th, had advanced rapidly toward the River Marne and Paris, and the Allies faced a crisis equally as grave as that of the Picardy offensive in March. Again every available man was placed at Marshal Foch\\'s disposal, and the Third Division, which had just come from its preliminary training in the trenches, was hurried to the Marne. Its motorized machine-gun battalion preceded the other units and successfully held the bridge-head at the Marne, opposite Chateau-Thierry.  The Second Division, in reserve near Montdidier, was sent by motor trucks and other available transport to check the progress of the enemy toward Paris. The division attacked and retook the town and railroad station at Bouresches and sturdily held its ground against the enemy\\'s best guard divisions. In the battle of Belleau Wood, which followed, our men proved their superiority and gained a strong tactical position, with far greater loss to the enemy than to ourselves. On July 1st, before the Second was relieved, it captured the village of Vaux with most splendid precision.  Meanwhile our Second Corps, under Maj.-Gen. George W. Read, had been organized for the command of our divisions with the British, which were held back in training areas or assigned to second-line defenses. Five of the ten divisions were withdrawn from the British area in June, three to relieve divisions in Lorraine and the Vosges and two to the Paris area to join the group of American divisions which stood between the city and any farther advance of the enemy in that direction.  The great June-July troop movement from the States was well under way, and, although these troops were to be given some preliminary training before being put into action, their very presence warranted the use of all the older divisions in the confidence that we did not lack reserves. Elements of the Forty-second Division were in the line east of Rheims against the German offensive of July 15th, and held their ground unflinchingly. On the right flank of this offensive four companies of the Twenty-eighth Division were in position in face of the advancing waves of the German infantry. The Third Division was holding the bank of the Marne from the bend east of the mouth of the Surmelin to the west of Mezy, opposite Chateau-Thierry, where a large force of German infantry sought to force a passage under support of powerful artillery concentrations and under cover of smoke screens. A single regiment of the Third wrote one of the most brilliant pages in our military annals on this occasion. It prevented the crossing at certain points on its front while, on either flank, the Germans, who had gained a footing, pressed forward. Our men, firing in three directions, met the German attacks with counter-attacks at critical points and succeeded in throwing two German divisions into complete confusion, capturing 600 prisoners.  The great force of the German Chateau-Thierry offensive established the deep Marne salient, but the enemy was taking chances, and the vulnerability of this pocket to attack might be turned to his disadvantage. Seizing this opportunity to support my conviction, every division with any sort of training was made available for use in a counter-offensive. The place of honor in the thrust toward Soissons on July 18th was given to our First and Second divisions in company with chosen French divisions. Without the usual brief warning of a preliminary bombardment, the massed French and American artillery, firing by the map, laid down its rolling barrage at dawn while the infantry began its charge. The tactical handling of our troops under these trying conditions was excellent throughout the action. The enemy brought up large numbers of reserves and made a stubborn defense both with machine guns and artillery, but through five days\\' fighting the First Division continued to advance until it had gained the heights above Soissons and captured the village of Berzy-le-sec. The Second Division took Beau Repaire farm and Vierzy in a very rapid advance and reached a position in front of Tigny at the end of its second day. These two divisions captured 7,000 prisoners and over 100 pieces of artillery.  The Twenty-sixth Division, which, with a French division, was under command of our First Corps, acted as a pivot of the movement toward Soissons. On the 18th it took the village of Torcy while the Third Division was crossing the Marne in pursuit of the retiring enemy. The Twenty-sixth attacked again on the 21st, and the enemy withdrew past the Chateau-Thierry-Soissons road. The Third Division, continuing its progress, took the heights of Mont St. Pere and the villages of Charteves and Jaulgonne in the face of both machine-gun and artillery fire.  On the 24th, after the Germans had fallen back from Trugny and Epieds, our Forty-second Division, which had been brought over from the Champagne, relieved the Twenty-sixth and, fighting its way through the Foret de Fere, overwhelmed the nest of machine guns in its path. By the 27th it had reached the Ourcq, whence the Third and Fourth divisions were already advancing, while the French divisions with which we were co-operating were moving forward at other points.  The Third Division had made its advance into Roncheres Wood on the 29th and was relieved for rest by a brigade of the Thirty-second. The Forty-second and Thirty-second undertook the task of conquering the heights beyond Cierges, the Forty-second capturing Sergy and the Thirty-second capturing Hill 230, both American divisions joining in the pursuit of the enemy to the Vesle, and thus the operation of reducing the salient was finished. Meanwhile the Forty-second was relieved by the Fourth at Chery-Chartreuve, and the Thirty-second by the Twenty-eighth, while the Seventy-seventh Division took up a position on the Vesle. The operations of these divisions on the Vesle were under the Third Corps, Maj.-Gen. Robert L. Bullard, commanding.   BATTLE OF ST. MIHIEL  With the reduction of the Marne salient we could look forward to the concentration of our divisions in our own zone. In view of the forthcoming operation against the St. Mihiel salient, which had long been planned as our first offensive action on a large scale, the First Army was organized on August 10th under my personal command. While American units had held different divisional and corps sectors along the western front, there had not been up to this time, for obvious reasons, a distinct American sector; but, in view of the important parts the American forces were now to play, it was necessary to take over a permanent portion of the line. Accordingly, on August 30th, the line beginning at Port sur Seille, east of the Moselle and extending to the west through St. Mihiel, thence north to a point opposite Verdun, was placed under my command. The American sector was afterwards extended across the Meuse to the western edge of the Argonne Forest, and included the Second Colonial French, which held the point of the salient, and the Seventeenth French Corps, which occupied the heights above Verdun.  The preparation for a complicated operation against the formidable defenses in front of us included the assembling of divisions and of corps and army artillery, transport, aircraft, tanks, ambulances, the location of hospitals, and the molding together of all of the elements of a great modern army with its own railheads, supplied directly by our own Service of Supply. The concentration for this operation, which was to be a surprise, involved the movement, mostly at night, of approximately 600,000 troops, and required for its success the most careful attention to every detail.

[Illustration: Photograph]   NOTED AMERICAN GENERALS   General March is chief of staff of the American Army,   Lieutenant-Generals Liggett and Bullard commanded the First and Second   Armies respectively, and Major-Generals Wright and Read are corps   commanders.   The French were generous in giving us assistance in corps and army artillery, with its personnel, and we were confident from the start of our superiority over the enemy in guns of all calibers. Our heavy guns were able to reach Metz and to interfere seriously with German rail movements. The French Independent Air Force was placed under my command which, together with the British bombing squadrons and our air forces, gave us the largest assembly of aviation that had ever been engaged in one operation on the western front.  From Les Eparges around the nose of the salient at St. Mihiel to the Moselle River the line was roughly forty miles long and situated on commanding ground greatly strengthened by artificial defenses. Our First Corps (Eighty-second, Ninetieth, Fifth, and Second divisions) under command of Major-General Hunter Liggett, restrung its right on Pont-a-Mousson, with its left joining our Third Corps (the Eighty-ninth, Forty-second, and First divisions), under Major-General Joseph T. Dickman, in line to Xivray, were to swing in toward Vigneulles on the pivot of the Moselle River for the initial assault. From Xivray to Mouilly the Second Colonial French Corps was in line in the center and our Fifth Corps, under command of Major-General George H. Cameron, with our Twenty-sixth Division and a French division at the western base of the salient, were to attack three difficult hills--Les Eparges, Combres, and Amaramthe. Our First Corps had in reserve the Seventy-eighth Division, our Fourth Corps the Third Division, and our First Army the Thirty-fifth and Ninety-first Divisions, with the Eightieth and Thirty-third available. It should be understood that our corps organizations are very elastic, and that we have at no time had permanent assignments of divisions to corps.  After four hours\\' artillery preparation, the seven American divisions in the front line advanced at 5 A. M., on September 12th, assisted by a limited number of tanks manned partly by Americans and partly by the French. These divisions, accompanied by groups of wire cutters and others armed with bangalore torpedoes, went through the successive bands of barbed wire that protected the enemy\\'s front line and support trenches, in irresistible waves on schedule time, breaking down all defense of an enemy demoralized by the great volume of our artillery fire and our sudden approach out of the fog.  Our First Corps advanced to Thiaucourt, while our Fourth Corps curved back to the southwest through Nonsard. The Second Colonial French Corps made the slight advance required of it on very difficult ground, and the Fifth Corps took its three ridges and repulsed a counter-attack. A rapid march brought reserve regiments of a division of the Fifth Corps into Vigneulles in the early morning, where it linked up with patrols of our Fourth Corps, closing the salient and forming a new line west of Thiaucourt to Vigneulles and beyond Fresnes-en-Woevre. At the cost of only 7,000 casualties, mostly light, we had taken 16,000 prisoners and 443 guns, a great quantity of material, released the inhabitants of many villages from enemy domination, and established our lines in a position to threaten Metz. This signal success of the American First Army in its first offensive was of prime importance. The Allies found they had a formidable army to aid them, and the enemy learned finally that he had one to reckon with.   MEUSE-ARGONNE OFFENSIVE, FIRST PHASE  On the day after we had taken the St. Mihiel salient, much of our corps and army artillery which had operated at St. Mihiel, and our divisions in reserve at other points, were already on the move toward the area back of the line between the Meuse River and the western edge of the forest of Argonne. With the exception of St. Mihiel, the old German front line from Switzerland to the east of Rheims was still intact. In the general attack all along the line, the operation assigned the American army as the hinge of this Allied offensive was directed toward the important railroad communications of the German armies through Mezieres and Sedan. The enemy must hold fast to this part of his lines or the withdrawal of his forces with four years\\' accumulation of plants and material would be dangerously imperiled.  The German army had as yet shown no demoralization and, while the mass of its troops had suffered in morale, its first-class divisions, and notably its machine-gun defense, were exhibiting remarkable tactical efficiency as well as courage. The German General Staff was fully aware of the consequences of a success on the Meuse-Argonne line. Certain that he would do everything in his power to oppose us, the action was planned with as much secrecy as possible and was undertaken with the determination to use all our divisions in forcing decision. We expected to draw the best German divisions to our front and to consume them while the enemy was held under grave apprehension lest our attack should break his line, which it was our firm purpose to do.  Our right flank was protected by the Meuse, while our left embraced the Argonne Forest whose ravines, hills, and elaborate defense screened by dense thickets had been generally considered impregnable. Our order of battle from right to left was the Third Corps from the Meuse to Malancourt, with the Thirty-third, Eightieth, and Fourth divisions in line, and the Third Division as corps reserve; the Fifth Corps from Malancourt to Vauquois, with Seventy-ninth, Eighty-seventh, and Ninety-first divisions in line, and the Thirty-second in corps reserve; and the First Corps, from Vauquois to Vienne le Chateau, with Thirty-fifth, Twenty-eighth, and Seventy-seventh divisions in line, and the Ninety-second in corps reserve. The army reserve consisted of the First, Twenty-ninth, and Eighty-second divisions.  On the night of September 25th our troops quietly took the place of the French who thinly held the line in this sector which had long been inactive. In the attack which began on the 26th we drove through the barbed wire entanglements and the sea of shell craters across No Man\\'s Land, mastering the first-line defenses. Continuing on the 27th and 28th, against machine guns and artillery of an increasing number of enemy reserve divisions, we penetrated to a depth of from three to seven miles, and took the village of Montfaucon and its commanding hill and Exermont, Gercourt, Cuisy, Septsarges, Malancourt, Ivoiry, Epinonville, Charpentry, Very, and other villages. East of the Meuse one of our divisions, which was with the Second Colonial French Corps, captured Marcheville and Rieville, giving further protection to the flank of our main body. We had taken 10,000 prisoners, we had gained our point of forcing the battle into the open and were prepared for the enemy\\'s reaction, which was bound to come as he had good roads and ample railroad facilities for bringing up his artillery and reserves.  In the chill rain of dark nights our engineers had to build new roads across spongy, shell-torn areas, repair broken roads beyond No Man\\'s Land, and build bridges. Our gunners, with no thought of sleep, put their shoulders to wheels and dragropes to bring their guns through the mire in support of the infantry, now under the increasing fire of the enemy\\'s artillery. Our attack had taken the enemy by surprise, but, quickly recovering himself, he began to fire counter-attacks in strong force, supported by heavy bombardments, with large quantities of gas. From September 28th until October 4th we maintained the offensive against patches of woods defended by snipers and continuous lines of machine guns, and pushed forward our guns and transport, seizing strategical points in preparation for further attacks.   OTHER UNITS WITH ALLIES  Other divisions attached to the Allied armies were doing their part. It was the fortune of our Second Corps, composed of the Twenty-seventh and Thirtieth divisions, which had remained with the British, to have a place of honor in co-operation with the Australian Corps, on September 29th and October 1st, in the assault on the Hindenburg line where the St. Quentin Canal passes through a tunnel under a ridge. The Thirtieth Division speedily broke through the main line of defense for all its objectives, while the Twenty-seventh pushed on impetuously through the main line until some of its elements reached Gouy. In the midst of the maze of trenches and shell craters and under cross-fire from machine guns the other elements fought desperately against odds. In this and in later actions, from October 6th to October 19th, our Second Corps captured over 6,000 prisoners and advanced over thirteen miles. The spirit and aggressiveness of these divisions have been highly praised by the British army commander under whom they served.  On October 2d to 9th our Second and Thirty-sixth divisions were sent to assist the French in an important attack against the old German positions before Rheims. The Second conquered the complicated defense works on their front against a persistent defense worthy of the grimmest period of trench warfare and attacked the strongly held wooded hill of Blanc Mont, which they captured in a second assault, sweeping over it with consummate dash and skill. This division then repulsed strong counter-attacks before the village and cemetery of Ste. Etienne and took the town, forcing the Germans to fall back from before Rheims and yield positions they had held since September, 1914. On October 9th the Thirty-sixth Division relieved the Second and, in its first experience under fire, withstood very severe artillery bombardment and rapidly took up the pursuit of the enemy, now retiring behind the Aisne.   MEUSE-ARGONNE OFFENSIVE, SECOND PHASE  The Allied progress elsewhere cheered the efforts of our men in this crucial contest as the German command threw in more and more first-class troops to stop our advance. We made steady headway in the almost impenetrable and strongly held Argonne Forest, for, despite this reinforcement, it was our army that was doing the driving. Our aircraft was increasing in skill and numbers and forcing the issue, and our infantry and artillery were improving rapidly with each new experience. The replacements fresh from home were put into exhausted divisions with little time for training, but they had the advantage of serving beside men who knew their business and who had almost become veterans over night. The enemy had taken every advantage of the terrain, which especially favored the defense, by a prodigal use of machine guns manned by highly-trained veterans and by using his artillery at short ranges. In the face of such strong frontal positions we should have been unable to accomplish any progress according to previously accepted standards, but I had every confidence in our aggressive tactics and the courage of our troops.  On October 4th the attack was renewed all along our front. The Third Corps tilting to the left followed the Brieulles-Cunel road; our Fifth Corps took Gesnes while the First Corps advanced for over two miles along the irregular valley of the Aire River and in the wooded hills of the Argonne that bordered the river, used by the enemy with all his art and weapons of defense. This sort of fighting continued against an enemy striving to hold every foot of ground and whose very strong counter-attacks challenged us at every point. On the 7th the First Corps captured Chatel-Chehery and continued along the river to Cornay. On the east of Meuse sector one of the two divisions co-operating with the French captured Consenvoye and the Haumont Woods. On the 9th the Fifth Corps, in its progress up the Aire, took Fleville, and the Third Corps, which had continuous fighting against odds, was working its way through Brieulles and Cunel. On the 10th we had cleared the Argonne Forest of the enemy.  It was now necessary to constitute a second army, and on October 9th the immediate command of the First Army was turned over to Lieutenant-General Hunter Liggett. The command of the Second Army, whose divisions occupied a sector in the Woevre, was given to Lieutenant-General Robert L. Bullard, who had been commander of the First Division and then of the Third Corps. Major-General Dickman was transferred to the command of the First Corps, while the Fifth Corps was placed under Major-General Charles P. Summerall, who had recently commanded the First Division. Major-General John L. Hines, who had gone rapidly up from regimental to division commander, was assigned to the Third Corps. These four officers had been in France from the early days of the expedition and had learned their lessons in the school of practical warfare.  Our constant pressure against the enemy brought day by day more prisoners, mostly survivors from machine-gun nests captured in fighting at close quarters. On October 18th there was very fierce fighting in the Caures Woods east of the Meuse and in the Ormont Woods. On the 14th the First Corps took St. Juvin, and the Fifth Corps, in hand-to-hand encounters, entered the formidable Kriemhilde line, where the enemy had hoped to check us indefinitely. Later the Fifth Corps penetrated further the Kriemhilde line, and the First Corps took Champigneulles and the important town of Grandpre. Our dogged offensive was wearing down the enemy, who continued desperately to throw his best troops against us, thus weakening his line in front of our Allies and making their advance less difficult.   DIVISIONS IN BELGIUM  Meanwhile we were not only able to continue the battle, but our Thirty-seventh and Ninety-first divisions were hastily withdrawn from our front and dispatched to help the French army in Belgium. Detraining in the neighborhood of Ypres, these divisions advanced by rapid stages to the fighting line and were assigned to adjacent French corps. On October 31st, in continuation of the Flanders offensive, they attacked and methodically broke down all enemy resistance. On November 3d the Thirty-seventh had completed its mission in dividing the enemy across the Escaut River and firmly established itself along the east bank included in the division zone of action. By a clever flanking movement troops of the Ninety-first Division captured Spitaals Bosschen, a difficult wood extending across the central part of the division sector, reached the Escaut, and penetrated into the town of Audenarde. These divisions received high commendation from their corps commanders for their dash and energy.   MEUSE ARGONNE--LAST PHASE  On the 23d the Third and Fifth corps pushed northward to the level of Bantheville. While we continued to press forward and throw back the enemy\\'s violent counter-attacks with great loss to him, a regrouping of our forces was under way for the final assault. Evidences of loss of morale by the enemy gave our men more confidence in attack and more fortitude in enduring the fatigue of incessant effort and the hardships of very inclement weather.  With comparatively well-rested divisions, the final advance in the Meuse-Argonne front was begun on November 1st. Our increased artillery force acquitted itself magnificently in support of the advance, and the enemy broke before the determined infantry, which, by its persistent fighting of the past weeks and the dash of this attack, had overcome his will to resist. The Third Corps took Aincreville, Doulcon, and Andevanne, and the Fifth Corps took Landres et St. Georges and pressed through successive lines of resistance to Bayonville and Chennery. On the 2d the First Corps joined in the movement, which now became an impetuous onslaught that could not be stayed.  On the 3d advance troops surged forward in pursuit, some by motor trucks, while the artillery pressed along the country roads close behind. The First Corps reached Authe and Chatillon-Sur-Bar, the Fifth Corps, Fosse and Nouart, and the Third Corps Halles, penetrating the enemy\\'s line to a depth of twelve miles. Our large caliber guns had advanced and were skillfully brought into position to fire upon the important lines at Montmedy, Longuyon, and Conflans. Our Third Corps crossed the Meuse on the 5th and the other corps, in the full confidence that the day was theirs, eagerly cleared the way of machine guns as they swept northward, maintaining complete coordination throughout. On the 6th, a division of the First Corps reached a point on the Meuse opposite Sedan, twenty-five miles from our line of departure. The strategical goal which was our highest hope was gained. We had cut the enemy\\'s main line of communications, and nothing but surrender or an armistice could save his army from complete disaster.  In all forty enemy divisions had been used against us in the Meuse-Argonne battle. Between September 26th and November 6th we took 26,059 prisoners and 468 guns on this front. Our divisions engaged were the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Twenty-sixth, Twenty-eighth, Twenty-ninth, Thirty-second, Thirty-third, Thirty-fifth, Thirty-seventh, Forty-second, Seventy-seventh, Seventy-eighth, Seventy-ninth, Eightieth, Eighty-second, Eighty-ninth, Ninetieth, and Ninety-first. Many of our divisions remained in line for a length of time that required nerves of steel, while others were sent in again after only a few days of rest. The First, Fifth, Twenty-sixth, Forty-second, Seventy-seventh, Eightieth, Eighty-ninth, and Ninetieth were in the line twice. Although some of the divisions were fighting their first battle, they soon became equal to the best.   OPERATIONS EAST OF THE MEUSE  On the three days preceding November 10th, the Third, the Second Colonial, and the Seventeenth French corps fought a difficult struggle through the Meuse Hills south of Stenay and forced the enemy into the plain. Meanwhile, my plans for further use of the American forces contemplated an advance between the Meuse and the Moselle in the direction of Longwy by the First Army, while, at the same time, the Second Army should assure the offensive toward the rich coal fields of Briey. These operations were to be followed by an offensive toward Chateau-Salins east of the Moselle, thus isolating Metz. Accordingly, attacks on the American front had been ordered and that of the Second Army was in progress on the morning of November 11th, when instructions were received that hostilities should cease at 11 o\\'clock A. M.  At this moment the line of the American sector, from right to left, began at Port-Sur-Seille, thence across the Moselle to Vandieres and through the Woevre to Bezonvaux in the foothills of the Meuse, thence along to the foothills and through the northern edge of the Woevre forests to the Meuse at Mouzay, thence along the Meuse connecting with the French under Sedan....  There are in Europe altogether, including a regiment and some sanitary units with the Italian army and the organizations at Murmansk, also including those en route from the States, approximately 2,053,347 men, less our losses. Of this total there are in France 1,338,169 combatant troops. Forty divisions have arrived, of which the infantry personnel of ten have been used as replacements, leaving thirty divisions now in France organized into three armies of three corps each.  The losses of the Americans up to November 18th are: Killed and wounded, 36,145; died of disease, 14,811; deaths unclassified, 2,204; wounded, 179,625; prisoners, 2,163; missing, 1,160. We have captured about 41,000 prisoners and 1,400 guns, howitzers and trench mortars....  Finally, I pay the supreme tribute to our officers and soldiers of the line. When I think of their heroism, their patience under hardships, their unflinching spirit of offensive action, I am filled with emotion which I am unable to express. Their deeds are immortal, and they have earned the eternal gratitude of our country.    CHAPTER LIX  PRESIDENT WILSON\\'S REVIEW OF THE WAR  On December 2, 1918, just prior to sailing for Europe to take part in the Peace Conference, President Wilson addressed Congress, reviewing the work of the American people, soldiers, sailors and civilians, in the World War which had been brought to a successful conclusion on November 11th. His speech, in part, follows:  \"The year that has elapsed since I last stood before you to fulfil my constitutional duty to give to the Congress from time to time information on the state of the Union has been so crowded with great events, great processes and great results that I cannot hope to give you an adequate picture of its transactions or of the far-reaching changes which have been wrought in the life of our Nation and of the world. You have yourselves witnessed these things, as I have. It is too soon to assess them; and we who stand in the midst of them and are part of them are less qualified than men of another generation will be to say what they mean or even what they have been. But some great outstanding facts are unmistakable and constitute in a sense part of the public business with which it is our duty to deal. To state them is to set the stage for the legislative and executive action which must grow out of them and which we have yet to shape and determine.  \"A year ago we had sent 145,918 men overseas. Since then we have sent 1,950,513, an average of 162,542 each month, the number in fact rising in May last to 245,951, in June to 278,760, in July to 307,182 and continuing to reach similar figures in August and September--in August 289,570 and in September 257,438. No such movement of troops ever took place before, across 3,000 miles of sea, followed by adequate equipment and supplies, and carried safely through extraordinary dangers of attack, dangers which were alike strange and infinitely difficult to guard against. In all this movement only 758 men were lost by enemy attacks, 630 of whom were upon a single English transport which was sunk near the Orkney Islands.  \"I need not tell you what lay back of this great movement of men and material. It is not invidious to say that back of it lay a supporting organization of the industries of the country and of all its productive activities more complete, more thorough in method and effective in results, more spirited and unanimous in purpose and effort than any other great belligerent had ever been able to effect. We profited greatly by the experience of the nations which had already been engaged for nearly three years in the exigent and exacting business, their every resource and every proficiency taxed to the utmost. We were the pupils. But we learned quickly and acted with a promptness and a readiness of co-operation that justify our great pride that we were able to serve the world with unparalleled energy and quick accomplishment.  \"But it is not the physical scale and executive efficiency of preparation, supply, equipment and dispatch that I would dwell upon, but the mettle and quality of the officers and men we sent over and of the sailors who kept the seas, and the spirit of the Nation that stood behind them. No soldiers, or sailors, ever proved themselves more quickly ready for the test of battle or acquitted themselves with more splendid courage and achievement when put to the test. Those of us who played some part in directing the great processes by which the war was pushed irresistibly forward to the final triumph may now forget all that and delight our thoughts with the story of what our men did. Their officers understood the grim and exacting task they had undertaken and performed with audacity, efficiency and unhesitating courage that touch the story of convoy and battle with imperishable distinction at every turn, whether the enterprise were great or small--from their chiefs, Pershing and Sims, down to the youngest lieutenant; and their men were worthy of them--such men as hardly need to be commanded, and go to their terrible adventure blithely and with the quick intelligence of those who know just what it is they would accomplish. I am proud to be the fellow-countryman of men of such stuff and valor. Those of us who stayed at home did our duty: the war could not have been won or the gallant men who fought it given their opportunity to win it otherwise; but for many a long day we shall think ourselves \\'accursed we were not there, and hold our manhoods cheap while any speaks that fought\\' with these at St. Mihiel or Thierry. The memory of those days of triumphant battle will go with these fortunate men to their graves; and each will have his favorite memory. \\'Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot, but he\\'ll remember with advantages what feats he did that day!\\'  \"What we all thank God for with deepest gratitude is that our men went in force into the line of battle just at the critical moment, and threw their fresh strength into the ranks of freedom in time to turn the whole tide and sweep of the fateful struggle--turn it once for all, so that henceforth it was back, back, back for their enemies, always back, never again forward! After that it was only a scant four months before the commanders of the central empires knew themselves beaten, and now their very empires are in liquidation!  \"And throughout it all how fine the spirit of the Nation was; what unity of purpose, what untiring zeal! What elevation of purpose ran through all its splendid display of strength, its untiring accomplishment. I have said that those of us who stayed at home to do the work of organization and supply will always wish that we had been with the men whom we sustained by our labor; but we can never be ashamed. It has been an inspiring thing to be here in the midst of fine men who had turned aside from every private interest of their own and devoted the whole of their trained capacity to the tasks that supplied the sinews of the whole great undertaking! The patriotism, the unselfishness, the thoroughgoing devotion and distinguished capacity that marked their toilsome labors, day after day, month after month, have made them fit mates and comrades of the men in the trenches and on the sea. And not the men here in Washington only. They have but directed the vast achievement. Throughout innumerable factories, upon innumerable farms, in the depths of coal mines and iron mines and copper mines, wherever the stuffs of industry were to be obtained and prepared, in the shipyards, on the railways, at the docks, on the sea, in every labor that was needed to sustain the battle lines men have vied with each other to do their part and do it well. They can look any man-at-arms in the face, and say, we also strove to win and gave the best that was in us to make our fleets and armies sure of their triumph!  \"And what shall we say of the women--of their instant intelligence, quickening every task that they touched; their capacity for organization and co-operation, which gave their action discipline and enhanced the effectiveness of everything they attempted; their aptitude at tasks to which they had never before set their hands; their utter self-sacrificing alike in what they did and in what they gave? Their contribution to the great result is beyond appraisal. They have added a new luster to the annals of American womanhood.  \"The least tribute we can pay them is to make them the equals of men in political rights as they have proved themselves their equals in every field of practical work they have entered, whether for themselves or for their country. These great days of completed achievement would be sadly marred were we to omit that act of justice. Besides the immense practical services they have rendered, the women of the country have been the moving spirits in the systematic economies by which our people have voluntarily assisted to supply the suffering peoples of the world and the armies upon every front with food and everything else that we had that might serve the common cause. The details of such a story can never be fully written, but we carry them at our hearts and thank God that we can say we are the kinsmen of such.  \"And now we are sure of the great triumph for which every sacrifice was made. It has come, come in its completeness, and with the pride and inspiration of these days of achievement quick within us we turn to the tasks of peace again--a peace secure against the violence of irresponsible monarchs and ambitious military coteries and made ready for a new order, for new foundations of justice and fair dealing.  \"We are about to give order and organization to this peace, not only for ourselves, but for the other peoples of the world as well, so far as they will suffer us to serve them. It is international justice that we seek, not domestic safety merely.  \"So far as our domestic affairs are concerned the problem of our return to peace is a problem of economic and industrial readjustment. That problem is less serious for us than it may turn out to be for the nations which have suffered the disarrangements and the losses of war longer than we. Our people, moreover, do not wait to be coached and led. They know their own business, are quick and resourceful at every readjustment, definite in purpose and self-reliant in action. Any leading strings we might seek to put them in would speedily become hopelessly tangled because they would pay no attention to them and go their own way. All that we can do as their legislative and executive servants is to mediate the process of change here, there and elsewhere as we may. I have heard much counsel as to the plans that should be formed and personally conducted to a happy consummation, but from no quarter have I seen any general scheme of reconstruction emerge which I thought it likely we could force our spirited businessmen and self-reliant laborers to accept with due pliancy and obedience.  \"While the war lasted we set up many agencies by which to direct the industries of the country in the services it was necessary for them to render, by which to make sure of an abundant supply of the materials needed, by which to check undertakings that could for the time be dispensed with and stimulate those that were most serviceable in war, by which to gain for the purchasing departments of the government a certain control over the prices of essential articles and materials, by which to restrain trade with alien enemies, make the most of the available shipping and systematize financial transactions, both public and private, so that there would be no unnecessary conflict or confusion--by which, in short, to put every material energy of the country in harness to draw the common load and make of us one team in accomplishment of a great task.  \"But the moment we knew the armistice to have been signed we took the harness off. Raw materials upon which the government had kept its hand for fear there should not be enough for the industries that supplied the armies have been released, and put into the general market again. Great industrial plants whose whole output and machinery had been taken over for the uses of the government have been set free to return to the uses to which they were put before the war. It has not been possible to remove so readily or so quickly the control of foodstuffs and of shipping, because the world has still to be fed from our granaries and the ships are still needed to send supplies to our men oversea and to bring the men back as fast as the disturbed conditions on the other side of the water permit; but even there restraints are being relaxed as much as possible, and more and more as the weeks go by.  \"Never before have there been agencies in existence in this country which knew so much of the field of supply of labor, and of industry as the War Industries Board, the War Trade Board, the Labor Department, the Food Administration and the Fuel Administration have known since their labors became thoroughly systematized; and they have not been isolated agencies; they have been directed by men which represented the permanent departments of the government and so have been the centers of unified and co-operative action. It has been the policy of the Executive, therefore, since the armistice was assured (which is in effect a complete submission of the enemy) to put the knowledge of these bodies at the disposal of the businessmen of the country and to offer their intelligent mediation at every point and in every matter where it was desired. It is surprising how fast the process of return to a peace footing has moved in the three weeks since the fighting stopped. It promises to outrun any inquiry that may be instituted and any aid that may be offered. It will not be easy to direct it any better than it will direct itself. The American business man is of quick initiative....  \"I welcome this occasion to announce to the Congress my purpose to join in Paris the representatives of the governments with which we have been associated in the war against the Central Empires for the purpose of discussing with them the main features of the treaty of peace. I realize the great inconveniences that will attend my leaving the country, particularly at this time, but the conclusion that it was my paramount duty to go has been forced upon me by considerations which I hope will seem as conclusive to you as they have seemed to me.  \"The Allied governments have accepted the bases of peace which I outlined to the Congress on the 8th of January last, as the Central Empires also have, and very reasonably desire my personal counsel in their interpretation and application, and it is highly desirable that I should give it, in order that the sincere desire of our government to contribute without selfish purpose of any kind to settlements that will be of common benefit to all the nations concerned may be made fully manifest. The peace settlements which are now to be agreed upon are of transcendent importance both to us and to the rest of the world, and I know of no business or interest which should take precedence of them. The gallant men of our armed forces on land and sea have consciously fought for the ideals which they knew to be the ideals of their country; I have sought to express those ideals; they have accepted my statements of them as the substance of their own thought and purpose, as the associated governments have accepted them; I owe it to them to see to it, so far as in me lies, that no false or mistaken interpretation is put upon them, and no possible effort omitted to realize them. It is now my duty to play my full part in making good what they offered their life\\'s blood to obtain. I can think of no call to service which could transcend this....  \"May I not hope, gentlemen of the Congress, that in the delicate tasks I shall have to perform on the other side of the sea in my efforts truly and faithfully to interpret the principles and purposes of the country we love, I may have the encouragement and the added strength of your united support? I realize the magnitude and difficulty of the duty I am undertaking. I am poignantly aware of its grave responsibilities. I am the servant of the Nation. I can have no private thought or purpose of my own in performing such an errand. I go to give the best that is in me to the common settlements which I must now assist in arriving at in conference with the other working heads of the associated governments. I shall count upon your friendly countenance and encouragement. I shall not be inaccessible. The cables and the wireless will render me available for any counselor service you may desire of me, and I shall be happy in the thought that I am constantly in touch with the weighty matters of domestic policy with which we shall have to deal. I shall make my absence as brief as possible and shall hope to return with the happy assurance that it has been possible to translate into action the great ideals for which America has striven.\"   [Illustration: Photograph]   Copyright Harris and Ewing.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenbergâ\\x84¢  Project Gutenbergâ\\x84¢ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.  Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenbergâ\\x84¢â\\x80\\x99s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenbergâ\\x84¢ collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenbergâ\\x84¢ and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.  Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundationâ\\x80\\x99s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your stateâ\\x80\\x99s laws.  The Foundationâ\\x80\\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundationâ\\x80\\x99s website and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact  Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenbergâ\\x84¢ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.  The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.  International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.  Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.  Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenbergâ\\x84¢ electronic works  Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenbergâ\\x84¢ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenbergâ\\x84¢ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.  Project Gutenbergâ\\x84¢ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.  Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org.  This website includes information about Project Gutenbergâ\\x84¢, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.'"
